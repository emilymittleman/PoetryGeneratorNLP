To map the consequences of regardless, of underestimate,
   Of feverish faith, of the mechanical modernism of your false terrain. As if
Port Sulphur remained nominal, its slick globules merely figurative
      Between territories of wait and wetlands of trust.
 
To etch the shallow-water horizon— a techno-utopian tribute
         To shrimp estuaries, bird rookeries, oyster bays,
To tube worms & sea turtles. To watercolor these pelican grasses,
            Oxidized, unapologetic executive marshes, roseated spoonbills.
 
For you who longed to smear concentric circles,
            To have trusted you with longitude and latitude,
To blur this sargassum border between mourning,
               Fighting, and willful denying of objects and subjects. As if
 
Generations of fishermen, scaling orders of magnitude,

Skeletal, ghostly swarms of now-opaque, milky jellyfish. As if

She says she had a baby
but I don’t believe her
Let me tell you the feeling
of relief when I started to believe her
baby wasn’t real
“What’s she getting out of it?”
I surrender without a fight
Ok, you can have your baby
 
Sometimes all you can do is reify your worst fears
What if I can’t have healthy relationships
Ever
With anything
Even your cat
 
Undressing in the open window
Like being in public
Is it not knowing or not caring?

I give a mini-lecture on insecure attachment

                    The Invention of the Saxophone
                ","
It was Adolphe Sax, remember,
not Saxo Grammaticus, who gets the ovation.
And by the time he had brought all the components
together–the serpentine shape, the single reed,
the fit of the fingers,
the upward tilt of the golden bell–
it was already 1842, and one gets the feeling
that it was also very late at night.
 
There is something nocturnal about the sound,
something literally horny,
as some may have noticed on that historic date
when the first odd notes wobbled out of his studio
into the small, darkened town,
 
summoning the insomniacs (who were up
waiting for the invention of jazz) to their windows,
but leaving the sleepers undisturbed,
evening deepening and warming the waters of their dreams.
 
For this is not the valved instrument of waking,
more the smoky voice of longing and loss,
the porpoise cry of the subconscious.
No one would ever think of blowing reveille
on a tenor without irony.
The men would only lie in their metal bunks,
fingers twined behind their heads,
afloat on pools of memory and desire.
 
And when the time has come to rouse the dead,
you will not see Gabriel clipping an alto
around his numinous neck.
 
An angel playing the world’s last song
on a glistening saxophone might be enough
to lift them back into the light of earth,
but really no further.
 
Once resurrected, they would only lie down
in the long cemetery grass
or lean alone against a lugubrious yew
and let the music do the ascending–
curling snakes charmed from their baskets–
while they wait for the shrill trumpet solo,
that will blow them all to kingdom come.

For Judy Williams Fraser 



1963-69 I lived on
the corner of Yew & York
on the 2nd floor
above  a corner store
with my sister Leni  & boyfriend soon to be husband Neap  Hoover
her friend Jo-Ann Huffman & her boyfriend Mike Sawyer
then  Elsa Young  (just left Robert who was with Maxine)
who met her lover Jack Wise next door
then my sister Mary
and my boyfriend  soon to be (later to unbe) husband Cliff Andstein
below us
bill bissett & martina & oolya  then painter-jogger  Gordon Payne
& Merrilyn  (who becomes my friend later)  then bill again then Gordon again
next to us
Bing Thom, Jay Bancroft & often Marian Penner, Rick Clarke
across the landing
John and Susan Newlove & children fathered by gerry gilbert
later the Ridgeways
and next to them directly opposite us:
Gerry Geisler (New Design Gallery)
and Helen Sturdy & children 
our kitchen faced theirs
apple pies in my oven & stew or toast in theirs
we cd smell everything like the time we fell asleep as pork hocks
simmered in my big red pot
charred and burned almost caught on fire
would have if Gerry hadnt woken us up
and that building a total tinderbox
always worried bill wd start one 
my bedroom / study faced
the Molson’s sign and Burrard Street Bridge
and I could watch the west end and highrises and planetarium grow
and white sheets on a clothesline across the street dry
as I’d sit at my bay window
and write and mark
on a smooth board cut to fit exactly the sill 
I’d glance up and see
people like  you  &  Jamie  &  Carol  &  Joan  &  Marcia  & the Trumans
and the Gadds  and the Lathams  and Lanny Beckman
walking up and down Yew Street
open the window & shout
drop by on your way back 
dropping by
everybody did it
days filled with coffee, tea, poetry, cigarette smoke
crises, trips, talkedy talk talk 
painting hard edged  strong coloured
also  intricate silver point mandalas
and collages 
a gallon of Calogna Red
one summery Saturday night
became a party
of 100 or even more
dancing in my bedroom to one music on a tape recorder
dancing in the other to another
drumming in the kitchen
talking in the room with the blue-tile fireplace
so many bodies I couldnt hear the music
from  inside the  hallway
just saw the taller heads
moving together to different beats
in almost darkness 
that crazy night at the Wahs’ place
if that wasnt a party of this kind
everybody landing on that bed
everybody kissing everybody
we had to go outside to pee
because the lineup for the can so long 
somehow to do with that small space
that it was so tight that everybody had to rub every
body simply to go anywhere
It was gorgeous 
after the Vancouver Poetry Conference (1963)
Roy Kiyooka started
dropping by   when he left his studio
there’d always be a light on
somewhere in our building
and he could visit  any of us
separately or clustered 
one time
he told me he had a painting he wanted to give me
but it was big and heavy
he borrowed a truck and someone helped him
up the dusty always dirty long stairs
with Hoarfrost
which we hung on a wall in a room just big enough to hold
my round oak table
(used to be Bowerings’ they bought a whole household of furniture for $80 and
when they moved they gave it to Joan and then when she moved she stored it
with me)
a wall that later Elsa and I tore apart with a screwdriver and hammer
shouting angry hexes at Robert all the way 
after and during that conference--
Olson, Creeley, Duncan, Levertov, Avison, Whalen, Ginsberg--
Roy and I became friends
and there were readings in my room
every second Sunday
red cast iron pot full of bean soup, corn chowder, spicey meatball vegetable stew
simmering and then cheese scones in the oven
people would come and read their new work one week
and the next week there’d be a Tish meeting
with Daphne Marlatt, Dan MacLeod, Pete Auxier, David Cull & David Dawson 
rent $60 a month didnt change
and some years it was cold
the wind so cold on side facing the North Shore
that Hydro was $60 per month
and that wall frozen behind my pillows 
the police were something else
they felt they had a right to question anybody so
Cliff would be up at the laundromat on 4th or
at Jackson’s to get some hamburger and be walking back with an
economics book in one hand and meat wrapped in brown paper in the other
and they’d stop him and ask him what he was doing and my friend Ray Wargo
would get stopped almost every second time he’d drop in to visit
where are you going and why and how long will you be 
someone was always getting busted
someone was always tripping out
someone was always visiting from   or going to  Europe or Japan 
here is a journal entry on June 9:
evening of the first ever national leaders debate on TV
“I am looking forward to seeing Trudeau--hope he gets pushed into/onto
answering more directly than he has in the past. I, like many others including
every gay man I know, do have a crush on him: he has much more style than
any Canadian politician so far. I mean style in the true sense of the word, it is
him, not affected… Cliff, of course, doesn’t trust him at all and thinks he’s a sell-
out. I don’t go that far, yet. But I do think that compromising is the only way a
politician can work this country and I do not like all the PR, razzmatazz,
fundraising, and allegiances that go into just getting elected: our system seems
to be based on gullibility…”  
coming home at night up Yew Street
whether from downtown or the beach or Paul the butcher’s or Elsie the baker’s
I loved looking up at my North-facing windows
goldy  gold  mesh curtains
light filtering through
so warm  and so inviting

I am forced to sleepwalk much of the time.
We hold on to these old ways, are troubled
sometimes and then the geyser goes away,
time gutted. In and of itself there is
no great roar, force pitted against force that
makes up in time what it loses in speed.
The waterfalls, the canyon, a royal I-told-you-so
comes back to greet us at the beginning.
How was your trip? Oh I didn’t last
you see, folded over like the margin
of a dream of the thing-in-itself. Well, and
what have we come to? A paper-thin past,
just so, and ‘tis pity. We regurgitate
old anthems and what has come to pass, and why
dwell on these. Why make things more difficult

and we can go on scrolling as though nothing had risen,

                    To disappear Black girls at a low volume of sustained public panic is to insinuate the inconstancy of Black girls. The disposability of Black girls who are prone to disappearance. A body bag somewhere waits with little hoopla about its lot. Absence becomes the lot of Black girls.
 
_________ will eventually accept as fact that absence becomes a lot of Black girls. In what becomes the normal day-to-day, Black girls are harder to find, _________ would think first, not that there are few attempts to find them. The question isn’t whether Black girls often go missing. If no one else, Black girls miss each other.
 
_________  would be remiss to not recognize how everything is made less in the absence of Black girls, if _________ could miss what _________ have never been required to recognize, such as:
 
Unlike missing Black girls, taking Black girls is a Western custom. It seems likely that such a statement will soon appear inaccurate: the white space in new textbook editions will have nothing to say about it, if the white spaces behind those textbooks have anything to say about it. That Black girls are quintessential American palimpsests is not a question but an anxiety. _________ would rather forget that Black girls were made receptacles for what the authors of Liberty and Independence would not speak. That Liberty and Independence were imaginable only in the absent-presence of taken Black girls, enslaved Black girls, Black girls on whom a foundational economic system so depended that white men would kill each other and take taken Black girls.
 
The constancy of Black girls is someone’s anxiety. The soil is thick with hidden Black girls, the myth that only quiet Black girls are worthwhile Black girls. The soil turns as _________  turn away from loud Black girls and their cacophonic insistence on Black girls.
 
_________ have not insisted enough upon the fact of Black girls, are often loudly shocked to find Black girls disappeared. Loud, unsustainable shock has a way of disappearing Black girls. Outrage, too, has a way of being disappeared.

The first step is to stop just beyond the weight of organs.
The sense of gravity sitting in tissue is like the space between
carcass and curb, before the reek worms into rock pores:
a sleeplessness there, that continual niche-trash. You too
 
once knew what it was to feel impressive. As the bed dissolves
into the walls, the walls disrobe themselves of their edges
and your resolve is now acute in the locking jaw of darkness.
Beg to be let. You, like bravery, leave behind the breath-inflated
 
lump, its depths, and its refusal to lace the cells of scars over even
the metaphorical guttings. To manage the act exceeds the box-
and-whisker of lately’s along-going. You’ve grown so accustomed
to mereness that what you call a life no longer houses the sublime.
 
It seems easy to leave. It seems this easy to leave. After
a second you’ll want to consider the centimeters of resistance
stitching air between here and all of elsewhere. But, still,
inhabit the bodiless second. To possess it is a bearable joy.

Strange to remember a visit, really not so
Long ago, which now seems, finally, past.   Always, it’s a
Kind of obvious thing I guess, amazed by that
Cycle: that first you anticipate a thing & it seems
Far off, the distance has a weight you can feel
Hanging on you, & then it’s there – that
Point – whatever – which, now, while
It’s happening seems to be constantly slipping away,
“Like the sand through your fingers in an old movie,” until
You can only look back on it, & yet you’re still there, staring
At your thoughts in the window of the fire you find yourself before.
We’ve gone over this a thousand times: & here again, combing that
Same section of beach or inseam for that – I’m no
Longer sure when or exactly where – “& yet” the peering,
Unrewarding as it is, in terms of tangible results,
Seems so necessary.
 
Hope, which is, after all, no more than a splint of thought
Projected outwards, “looking to catch” somewhere –
What can I say here? – that the ease or
Difficulty of such memories doesn’t preclude
“That harsher necessity” of going on always in
A new place, under different circumstances:
& yet we don’t seem to have changed, it’s
As if these years that have gone by are
All a matter of record, “but if the real
Facts were known” we were still reeling from
What seems to have just happened, but which,
“By the accountant’s keeping” occurred years.
Ago.   Years ago.   It hardly seems possible,
So little, really, has happened.
 
We shore ourselves hour by hour
In anticipation that soon there will be
Nothing to do.   “Pack a sandwich
& let’s eat later.”   And of course,
The anticipation is quite appropriate, accounting,
For the most part, for whatever activity
We do manage.    Eternally buzzing over the time,
Unable to live in it…
 
“Maybe if we go upaways we can get a better
View.”   But, of course, in that sense, views don’t
Improve.   “In the present moment” (if we could only see
It, which is to say, to begin with, stop looking with
Such anticipation) what is enfolding before us puts to
Rest any necessity for “progression”.
 
So, more of these tracings, as if by some magic
Of the phonetic properties of these squiggles…   Or
Does that only mystify the “power” of “presence"" which
Is, as well, a sort of postponement.

otherwise. Water will quiver in driftwood. Sound preceding absence,
a white dog trailing a smaller one: ghost and noon shadow, two motes
disappearing into surf. And when the low tide comes lapping and clear, the curled
fronds of seaweed will furl and splay, their algal sisters brushing strands
against sands where littleneck clams feed underwater. Light rain will fall
and one cannot help but lean into the uncertainty of the sea. Bow: a knot

will dip our hands to feel what can’t be seen. Horseshoe crabs whose blue
blood rich in copper will reach for cover, hinged between clouds and

                    Will haul this gelatinous body, will lash forward this non-form, will push this organism of gas through the gray regions.
 
A sour wind tears through the thin white hair. A wind of vinegar and henbane tears in the rustling, discarded bird-shells that were abandoned empty and fragile when the throbbing bird-boils moved on toward so-called life. Now I see the cunning needle-trees sling these clumps of heavy pouch-flesh back and forth between them: small feather-birds “fly” above my heads.
 
I haul myself, I haul myself, I haul my dragging structure along the river furrow’s muddy, sloppily overlapping slopes. I am so bitter, so wet, so the mouth smears the inside with the sweetness of the chewed-up blood-chisel. Out of this blood I am going to suck my nourishment for some time.
 
I haul, I urge my dissolved substance, slowly forward across the metal of calm stones, the hovering thread-glue’s suction toward a point in the distant middle of the perspective. Where the river’s banks will meet and like the thinnest needle of silver of liquid will drill its dark tunnel-water straight into the heart of the dying image, this moistly broken-up surface of paper to which we cling.
 
I haul I haul I touch myself, touch the skin-rind with chafed-up viscous fingers. Little mermaid from ocean foam molded–I haul my long veils, layers of elastic cartilage, of slippery, shimmering membranes, chlorophyll. The gills shudder and glow deep down in this chasm of tissue–constantly rustling, squeaking, gasping for air. This whirling, howling, desperate lack of oxygen; the scream–if it had had enough oxygen to scream and a mouth with which to scream–the scream to swallow the entire lung full of clear wind.
 
Lizards play, glitter green, blue, and red between the skin membranes of the body dress. Where does this mass end? I search inward through strata to find the core of my plasma wet from juices, to find the core of body-flesh despite the outer, surrounding flesh, the naked body’s stable surface, a kind of human here inside the bluing, plant-becoming. Something to hold on to behind the spread of the sickness of mud, fermentation. But there is nothing to grasp beneath this mantle of slippery webbed skin, burst through by a pounding net of veins.
 
I now lick my tongue against the outer claws of the fingers to tear life into the ions, to make sores bitter in the tongue’s blue ventricles. A kind of pain therefore radiates against the inner glands, a faint spasm of cheers before this, the nervous system’s last chance to communicate with the dying I. The mists smart, shimmer, the lumps of blue cobalt from the mustard gas corrode through the otherwise red shroud-clouds that drag their bellies against the river’s surface. In one of the skin-folds between the pockets of the genital dress, lizards gather in heaps of glimmering scales.
 
But time runs on time and starvation and the weakness carries me in across the gray regions. And the soul’s dark night will slowly be lowered through me. That is why I now slowly fold myself like a muscle against the wet clay to press the flesh against the sleep-gland’s mouths. I will sleep now in my bird body in the down, and a bitter star will radiate eternally above the glowing face’s watercourse.

Up on the roof, waiting for the fireworks to begin
in warm winter rain, a moment ago I stepped
from the elevator into the black air
of an almost New Year
and need a minute to catch my breath
at the spread of city open to my eye.
I can't go to the edge; I never could.
The old fear of height still troubles me,
the sensation that nothing can be under me
if I am surrounded by mist and rain
and all of the dark night air we breathe.
Even a glimpse at the treetops in the park,
with its slick crisscrossing roads that plunge
into the jumbled panorama of East Side Manhattan,
hysterical tonight with its own incandescence,
gives me the willies. I feel as if
I were standing on the deck of a showboat of a cloud
as it drifts down some dark river, waiting for it
to bang into some other building's fifteenth floor.
How can these old people hunch the railing,
hoisting their plastic glasses of champagne
from under dripping umbrellas, as if
they drank the rain as they laugh
their analyses of the weather?
Maybe now, like me, they have nothing to lose.
I moved in three weeks ago; this is my first trip
to the roof. I don't want to die tonight,
the first fatality of 1990! There's too much of me
I left in pieces last year, oh, the whole last decade:
But I'm up here to distract myself, temporarily,
from what I don't want or can't have
in the way of love. . . . That must be
the Triborough Bridge, tied in its strings
of blue lights, and I can see in Central Park
the skating rink, like a scoured mirror below,
where some madman waves a red lantern; he
must be drunk. I have only sipped a speck of Drambuie,
which I didn't carry in my Coca-Cola glass
up to these festivities. This is the first New Year's
I've spent alone in twenty, twenty-two years.
I never could go to the edge; but I did.
Out there in the dark: my marriage, the woman
I loved badly, as she did me, or none too well;
the places we lived; the apartment I once half-owned;
the thousands of books I had to leave behind
(though I am to be granted library privileges)
and the black and white cat I really miss.
My wife's with her friends tonight somewhere in Brooklyn;
friends of mine out there, too, though I don't know
where. It's just like me to move in the middle
of a telephone company strike. Thus, no calls
from anyone—and I don't even have
a telephone yet, so who could call? Damp but trying
to smile, I eye the revelers. Two young men
and their enormous girlfriends have joined us,
really large women who carry balloons, all ready
to froth in merry champagne. We check
our watches to the screams from swarms
of apartment windows to the west
as the sky lights up with the first furious
bombardment of colored shells. I can see that
red lantern swinging toward the rockets—aha!
So it wasn't a drunk, but the fireworks engineer
preparing to blow the year's last sky
to smithereens for our delight!
I like to follow the tiny spurts of flame
from the launching pad in their heavenward trajectory
as much as I like the rockets' red glare,
the bombs bursting in air, which give proof
to the night that I am still here, hands
jammed in the pockets of my sodden raincoat,
face dripping with rain, hat soaked, wondering
if the skinny guy in the army jacket behind me
(who looks just like I did in the sixties)
is mumbling his way into a combat flashback
and ready to hurl me over the edge of the roof
and into kingdom come. I guess not yet. We've
survived the first blasts of spinning green,
corkscrews of spangled flame, buds of fireballs
spewed in arching gold sprays, the whistling fire-fish
that curl and howl as they flare, falling to ash.
Screaming its head off, the New York New Year enters.
I feel sad that beautiful things must die,
even shadows made of smoke and flame,
whatever I thought I had made out of my life—
music, poems, books, kisses, a little useless fame.
The army guy behind me grumbles at the haze
of rocket smoke that coils around the trees,
then tumbles up into the air toward Harlem.
That bump and thud and bump sound everywhere,
more clouds smacking each other head-on.
The flashes of the explosions are close enough
to touch if you wanted to burn your fingers
on the sky, and the glare rocks our shadows back
against the brick, as if chaos snapped
our pictures in the dark. I smile for my portrait,
curious at the New Year, smelling the acrid smoke
of the one we've just destroyed. Then I squeeze into
the tiny elevator car with the others, anonymous,
reconciled to be so, back to my little apartment
and the waiting glass of amber drink I'll raise,
only half in jest, to my new life.

For Rebecca Feldman and Brian Roessler



That's what the first line says
of the song I've been playing all summer
at the keyboard—trying to get my hands
around its dark, melancholy chords,
its story line of a melody that twists
up like snakes from melodic minor scales
that I've also been trying to learn, though
I'm no great shakes as a practicer of scales. 
Come to think of it, neither am I much
when it comes to love—no great shakes, I mean.
Not that I haven't had my chances.
Twenty years married, I made a lousy husband,
half asleep, selfish, more like a big baby
than a grown man, the poet laureate
of the self-induced coma when it came to
doing anything for anybody but me.
""Now and then he took his thumb
out of his mouth to write an ode to
or a haiku about the thumb he sucked all day."" 
That's what I imagined my ex-wife said
to our therapist near the end. She did say:
""It's all about Bill."" She was right.
And suddenly it frightens me, remembering
how, at our wedding, our poet friends
read poems of (mostly) utter depression
to salute us. I wondered if their griefs in love
had double-crossed our union, if strange
snakes in the grass of our blissful Eden
had hissed at us, and now I worry,
on your wedding day, if I'm not
doing the same damned thing . . . . 
I haven't come to spring up and put my curse
on your bliss. Here's what I want to say:
You're young. You don’t know what love is.
And as the next line of the song goes, you won't
—""Until you know the meaning of the blues.""
Darlings, the blues will come (though not
often, I hope) to raise their fiery swords
against your paradise. A little of that
you unwittingly got today, when it rained
and you couldn't be married outside under
the beautiful tree in Nan and Alan's yard.
But paradise doesn't have to be structured
so that we can never reenter it. After
you've kicked each other out of it
once or twice (I'm speaking metaphorically,
of course), teach yourself how to say
a few kind words to each other.
Don't stand there angry, stony.
Each of you let the other know
what you are feeling and thinking 
and then it may be possible
to return to each other smiling,
hand in hand. For arm in arm,
you are your best Eden. Remember
the advice the old poet sang to you
on the afternoon of August 4, 2001,
the day you got married.
May you enjoy a good laugh
thinking of him and his silver thumb
now that you've turned the key
into your new life in the beautiful
Massachusetts rain and—hey, now—sun!

                    Where X Marks the Spot
                ","
Not long after you had told me, gently,
that you still grieved for your last love,
though that had ended almost a year before,
and that you could have no intimate relationship
with me, maybe not with anyone for a time,
I stopped my fork in the air with whatever hung
on the end of it that I was eating.
My throat wouldn't swallow.
I felt weak and sick, as if it were myself
that I devoured, piece by piece, as you talked away
the hopes that I had put in your lovely face.
It was the old story coming true for me once more,
though you were hardly mine. . . .
When we finished I walked you back to your car;
I don't remember having much to say.
Why would I? Buildings drifted by,
and cars, and faces. Then we arrived at the place
where, afterwards, I would never see you again,
at a parking lot near Times Square.
There I marked the sidewalk with X's
visible only to me: ""At this place
I was lost again,"" they'd say to me
when I walked there in the future.
""Dig here and find what's left of me,
or what I left behind, where X marks the spot.""
I felt like the death's-head and crossed bones
that surmount the treasure chest.
I only felt a little like gold coins and jewels.
I have signed the City with these sphinxes
—in parks, in streets, in bedrooms,
in my own apartments. And there we stood,
you and I, hemmed in by the stitches of X's
that could not hold you to me. But X's
mean kisses, I realized, as well as
what is lost: all the kisses I couldn't give you
chalked like symbols on the sidewalk.
After all, you yourself had been marked
by loss, even in your laughter that afternoon
at the show I had taken you to. Bright-eyed
and smiling in the seat beside me, you
stole my glances with your dark, dark eyes
and your long hair. I thought that I had not been
this happy in a long time with a woman
and was ready to become even more happy,
ready to do anything that you wanted
in order to please you, to see that smile come up,
not knowing what you were soon to say to me
as we dined. And when you spoke,
I felt life fall away from me. Again I felt
that I would never be happy. I felt the words
that I had wanted to say to you leaving me, rushing
out of my chest like dead air, until I had no more words
to say. I seemed to cut and swallow my food
as if it were me myself that stuck in pieces
on the end of the fork I had raised to my mouth.
Had I been chewing on my own flesh?
Self-Pity the Devourer took me by the hand
that held the fork, and once again I feasted
on all that was dark and hopeless in myself,
in lieu of all that was beautiful, desirable,
and unattainable in you. And then
I stood beside you in the lot where you
had parked your car, with the X's buzzing
in the air, sticking themselves to you
and me and the blacktop and the cars.
When you reached out to embrace me, I
moved to embrace you in return—and then came
the part that I don't want to remember,
the part I hate: I caught a glimpse of your
face as we put our arms around each other,
and your face said everything to me about
how you had wasted the afternoon, how eager
you were to speed away in your car, a mixture
of disgust and relief that the thing would soon
be over, that I would be crossed out forever
from your life—and everything that I hated
about myself, my stupid chin, my ugly nose,
my hopeless balded head, my stuck-out ears,
my wreck of a heart, crashed over me,
spinning me into the vortex of a palpable self-hate
that I have only ever let myself feel
a little bit at a time, though it is always there

Like guns and cars, cameras
are fantasy-machines whose use is addictive.
—Susan Sontag

 



I place a photograph of my uncle on my computer desktop, which means I learn to ignore it. He stands by a tank, helmet tilting to his right, bootlaces tightened as if stitching together a wound. Alive the hand brings up a cigarette we won't see him taste. Last night I smoked one on the steps outside my barn apartment. A promise I broke myself. He promised himself he wouldn't and did. I smell my fingers and I am smelling his. Hands of smoke and gunpowder. Hands that promised they wouldn't, but did.           
This album is a stop-loss. By a dim lantern
or in the latrine
he flips through it.
He looks at himself
looking nearly as he does—
closest to himself then
as he could be, just learning
how to lean into his new body.
He suspends there
by standing order,
a spreading fire in his chest,
his groin. He is on stage
for us to see him, see him?
He stands in the noontime sun.

how they propel you, 
how they can kick in

in an aerial bombardment,
mosquito netting doused 
in napalm–cheekbones fragile
as moth wings beneath the heel.
You tighten your laces

swings you forward,
goose-stepping pendulums 
a body less and less yours–

But I sat rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets
But it was not a table of fallen men
But my hand registered fatigue

Operation Ramadan was an offensive in the Iran-Iraq War. It was launched by Iran in July 1982 near Basra and featured the use of human wave attacks in one of the largest land battles since World War II. Aftermath: The operation was the first of many disastrous offensives which cost thousands of lives on both sides. This one in general boosted the casualty limit up to 80,000 killed, 200,000 wounded, and 45,000 captured. In retrospect, the Iranians lacked effective command and control, air support, and logistics to sustain an attack in the first place. Saddam Hussein offered several ceasefire attempts in the following year, none of which were accepted by the Revolutionary regime. [6] [dead link]

he's at the center of it, 
everyone else in the house
falling into the backdrop— 
my mother, grandmother,
an uncle, all dead now—props 
in our story: father and daughter
caught in memory's half-light. 
I'm too young to recall it,
so his story becomes the story: 
1969, Hurricane Camille
bearing down, the old house 
shuddering as if it will collapse.
Rain pours into every room 
and he has to keep moving,
keep me out of harm's way— 
a father's first duty: to protect.
And so, in the story, he does: 
I am small in his arms, perhaps
even sleeping. Water is rising 
around us and there is no
higher place he can take me 
than this, memory forged
in the storm's eye: a girl 
clinging to her father. What

Here too, for the Confederacy,

how they tore open tea bags

made of Lipton. How this finger of spring
dug one delicate root down

The door to the past is a strange door. It swings open and things pass through it, but they pass in one direction only. No man can return across that threshold, though he can look down still and see the green light waver in the weeds.

A door opens in the wilderness.
People cross through it—bloused women families
 
Acquaintances friends all the ones I have loved
Sleep-walkers night-walkers each dazed and shorn—
 
Street aurous with ice, a snowfall scratched into
Moons—and everything I’d known—
 
Inside the bleak floating light of my lungs
In the capillaries of my eyes a blood
 
Glancing through the hatches—
If I said I would always be grateful
 
If I lied or touched with spite
If night is just a foamline of shadows
 
Though we were both lost—the door
Opening—the fear of being shown
 
Whole to the one who must love you still—
And stopped as if on a walk to say
  Look at that and what matters what really counts 
And I’ll tell you everything if you promise I promise
 
I stood at door and behind me heard
Snow-plows scrape against roads
 
At the center of night—unknown to yourself 
And the word I said out-loud to no one
 
That meant it was all to no purpose 
The word for the desire inside destruction 
 
For everything that can never be brought back—
Loose snow blown hard to each bank
 
And the common reel of those who
To avoid one extreme rush toward its opposite—
 
Snow blasted to piles—and never opened up to
Anything that could reach me until you reached me—
 
Which hours belonged to us
When was I unknowingly alone
 
Why did you always return to walk here a path
Behind my closed eyes shedding salt
 
Dry snowfall and sticks—still were you here
With me I might say The moon rose in the casement window 
  The red-haired boy across the street has learned to ride his bike
There are still picnics there are fountains
 
And the world I am leaving behind says One learns to see one learns to be kind—
 
I closed my eyes I closed my hands
I shut down the fields in my arms
 
The cattle on the plains veins ditches
Blue ravines a gray bird
 
Sailing through a poplar brake kids
Throwing snow I closed the last swinging juncos
 
Sheep wool caught on barbed wire I closed
Fumes and clear patches of sky I seized
 
The river the town I shut down
The hard muscles of sleep farmlands
 
Warming under midnight salt-lights scruff-pines
On the ridge animals scattering across slopes I closed
 
The smooth bone of evening a storm
On the hills white and noiseless spindled
 
Prairies where I was born I shut I seized
The clouds I closed in anger—fervor—ardor

Everything you thought you knew
must be relearned overnight.
 
How to walk.
Walk, not trip, over cords, 2x4s,
used coffee cups, concrete cores.
Walk, 40 pounds on your shoulder, across
rebar or a wood plank; glide,
not wobble, not look like the bounce
beneath each bootstep scares you.
 
How to dress yourself
to work outdoors all day midwinter
and keep warm, keep working, fingers moving;
or midsummer, with no hint of breasts.
 
How to climb ladders–
not a stepstool or a 4-footer–
ladders that stretch up two stories
where someone’s impatient
for that bundle of pipe.
 
How to get coffee–
hot and how they like it–to a crew
spread out 10 floors; to carry muffins
three blocks in a paper sack
through sheets of rain.
 
How to look.
To never go back empty-handed
when you’re told, Grab me a This/That from the gangbox, if all you’ve done
is move things around, poke here and there;
if you haven’t emptied out the full contents
so the journeyman won’t shame you
by finding This/That in a quick minute,
after you’ve said, We don’t have any. 
 
How to be dependable
but not predictable-provokable.
Not the lunch break entertainment.
 
How to read
blueprints,
delivery orders,
the mood on the job;
how long it’s okay to sit down for coffee;
how early you can start rolling up cords.
 
How to do well in school
from the back row
of a seats-assigned-Jim-Crow classroom
How to learn tricks-of-the-trade
from someone who does not like you.
 
How to listen, to act-don’t-ask.
To duck when someone motions, Duck! 
Or when someone tells you, Don’t talk to Zeke,
to know what they mean
so you don’t even look
at Zeke, the ironworker who’s always first out,
last in, standing there, so four times a day–
start, lunch, quit–all the workers walk past him,
like a sandbar, waves washing back and forth,
that catches debris.
 
How to pick up the phone and call your friend,
the only one of the women not at class
the night the apprenticeship director met you all
at the door
carrying the nervous rumor
that one of the women had been raped
and you all look at each other
and it wasn’t any of you five.
 
How to respond–within protocol–
when someone takes your ladder or tools,
imitates your voices on the loudspeaker,
spraypaints Cunt on your Baker staging,
urinates in your hardhat,
drives to your home
where you live alone
with your daughter
and keys your truck parked
in your own driveway.
 
Later, you’ll need the advanced skills:
how–without dislodging the keystone–
to humiliate a person, how to threaten
a person. Deftly.
So no one’s certain for absolute
that’s what happened. Not even you.

My lost sister used to try the trick
with the tablecloth, waiting until

smug as a matador, staring down

paying no mind to the ancestor gloom
gliding across the wallpaper like clouds

the trick would work this time, all those she loved

to be called to the mahogany room
for supper, to find something missing,

flopping in my heart.
Each an ambition bird.
 
The bird wants to be dropped

He wants to light a kitchen match

He wants to fly into the hand of Michelangelo

He wants to pierce the hornet’s nest

He wants to take bread and wine
and bring forth a man happily floating in the Caribbean.
 
He wants to be pressed out like a key
so he can unlock the Magi.
 
He wants to take leave among strangers
passing out bits of his heart like hors d’oeuvres.
 
He wants to die changing his clothes

— Rainer Maria Rilke, tr. by Stephen Mitchell



The fresco cracks cooperatively over time. Not to give a secret away
but gradually to break off keeping it. In the sky you make birds
like this, one wing longer than the other, an asymmetrical v
wedged against wind, one stroke longer than another,
never the bodies turned the same direction, each finding
its own angle, and one, in the distance,
a dot. These are the Deadly Birds of the Soul
Rilke was forced to call terrifying.
Migratory, weighing no more than a pencil.
Because every flying thing is passionate, and every flight
a posture torn from stone.
There was a time it was a theme
parents would pay an artist to realize — the face of a beloved son,
a Luca or Piero, painted onto the shoulders of Tobias,
painted into the company of Raphael. You tell yourselves
and your quiet house
no harm will come to the boy
as he goes out. A guardian, though, is not a guard. To keep safe
is subtly different from confining. Radiance can strategically
direct itself to seem like us, ready, as it were, to walk.
As a mirror goes through the appearance of requiring
subsistence, goes through the motions of a meal
whose food appears to be food.
Radiance, we know, is never quite as warm as light.
Who has not tasted the silver in sea mist?
Whosever they are, angels are the first to surface there.
You know a guardian by the silver of a river-crossing,
of a father’s filmy eyes, in gall, heart, fire,
and mostly smoke. In smoke and mostly mirror.
As, wedged between forward and backward being,
rehashing and planning ahead, presence will be specked again
with being erased, a reusable writing surface
calling down to the life without rest, the self-propelled
surveillances of sharks.

lust past all lost 
astronomy and wipeout,

of suicide in syllables, fifth

Can you akin? Can you 
hear it, pinned to the unseasonable underearth, 
an option for music and water 
constantly changing shape, an answer 
in dissonance? To hear desire 
is to wake yourself inside, upturned, 
long enough to know 
tomorrow is exile. Chaos, body harp, 
and painted butt music, crowd-crawl, rose 
crowned to the chest, rabbit 
call and playing cards    ...    listen, 
I’m hell-humming in 
your direction, giddy, I am too taken 
to leave it alone, the will 
locked in as if it is already 
inside of me now: to fall.

crave, spilled gut-platter

I have a need to see the painting when no one is looking. The god-
thought if there was such a thing, inconsolable, of Saturday
reaching for Sunday to ride out onto the Indian Ocean like
an argument of starched waves in their coffin-white lace I might
finger as I pass. There are hands in the paintings: raised, pointing,
folded, reaching, reaching    ...    there’s a leporello book intended for
my ex-lover’s breathing, weather balloons like colored severed heads
laughing their way up the sky’s fever-continuing threshold of three
miles withholding this formula for desire. Beside the one body and its
skying figures of speech, night’s impressionist-flecked mask captured
by singing: try to inhale. And again, please. Cough up cadmium twice,
suddenly. Carry the caraway seed page away, fill your sea purse head
with the tiny unborn. Painting, like digging up your garden in the dark,
isn’t spring. Isn’t daddy root, mama bud pullulating for some creation.
Isn’t spring. Isn’t season’s salt measure for your worth. Whoever
told you that lied about what’s to be framed next.

An erasure of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s “Palingenesis”



I, sobbing in the rolling mist,
Started for peopled days. In dreams
A faded, lonely promontory shed petals.
Belief exists. Cunning with its perfume
Working from youth, defiance. A phantom
Vanished. The swift surrenders, leap into
The old dead heart of lies.

Into foliage. Of what light unseen!
What, what, what, what, what, what
Will hold still without its end?

On occasion, when the mood takes him
as it so often does, he will put down 
his papers, get up from his kindly old chair,
and leave for a while the sweeping beam 
to sow its charitable seed — that seed which,
when falling on the ground 
of a helmsman’s fertile consciousness,
ought germinate in it a cautious vigilance. 
He descends then, the long corkscrew of
the stairs and opens at their base the metal door 
so that he may take a closer look at what might
be beyond his tower’s environs. There he always 
finds the churning world, she laps at him from
every side with no respite, and spatters him 
with spray. Thanks to a certain modulation,
a tone which he adopted long ago

there is no danger here from neither shark

Indeed, were there such creatures hidden

knowingly at the whole thing. And so it is
that as he gazes out, he cannot help

When the language teacher talks about le capitalisme: 
the gesture of three fingers rubbing imaginary fabric. 
I’m a tourist, vulnerable and stupid, 
my legs showing, shoes practical, face red. 
Together, we try to reconstruct an anecdote 
whose contents have scattered. A motorcycle passes, a French police siren 
you say sounds innocuous then we both laugh sourly. 
I hadn’t seen a woman slap a child in some time. 
A truck reversing, and the alarm that continues for hours one morning. 
Porn on a handheld device, its tinny echo in a room 
with bare floors and very little furniture. 
Across the courtyard, this T-shirt on a hanger out the window 
turns in the light breeze as if trying to look behind itself. 
I’m consumed with not knowing where to buy paper, safety pins, stamps. 
The window frames of that building are red, emerging from gray gables. 
Enormous bumblebee at the threshold investigates the doorway, doesn’t enter. 
The flies do; they’re promiscuous; they leave. 
I don’t know the word for because. 
So each act is disconnected from another. 
I can almost imagine there are no consequences, 
the days just pass, one sunny, one cloudy, someone unseen shouts, sirens 
every few hours, clouds move in a solemn procession across 
a wide sky staggered with chimneys, 
people wait to cross the street, a large tree tosses its wig a little. 
Other small trees in the courtyard flicker. 
They are responsive. 
The sun heats the pavement; le pavé répond. 
You send me a short erotic video, you’re naked, propositioning me. 
Do you act more like the coin or the water? 
Across the narrow street this bird 
sipping from roof puddles 
seems more dove than pigeon. 
Pacing, grandmotherly, she stops to look at me. 
Do you just know how to love another person 
like someone knew to paint those window frames red? 
Most of the architecture looks floral, like a boring math problem. 
The crosses that reach and reach. 
Why does the scrape of the furniture when I rearrange it 
sound like crass American English to me? 
I slept late, now I’m watching the clouds, like clouds 
in an eighteenth-century painting. Overly articulate. 
Except these clouds are not trying to symbolize anything. 
Where’s my dove. 
I always want to go look at people. 
A booth selling copies of copies of Louis Vuitton. 
The small shadow the roof makes on another roof right next to it. 
When my friend came to Paris she wanted to break everything. 
Impeccable shoes on the impeccable feet. 
Clothes so new they’re creamy, and to seem to never have to  compromise. 
I feel tattered when I’m actually not. 
I’m an American, I eat. 
A huge decorative basket of citrus snugged beside me in the upscale bistro. 
The woman from a building opposite comes down, indignant: 
Who threw a pomelo into my window? 
You read to me about the history of the barricade. 
I picture the drab suburbs. 
The shoulders and elbows of people in the museum evoke more reaction 
in me than most of the paintings. 
A young lithe person with live eyes tends bar, gender trouble tattooed up their arm. 
I count twenty-nine sleeping bags lined up beneath the overhang 
and each one inhabited. 
I read to you about the history of enclosure. 
Two people talking on a balcony, their black hair blowing. 
One leaning over into the courtyard. 
Behind the cathedral, vulgar black felt stapled in the raised flowerbeds 
to mask their frames. 
The river stinks, allures, as a specific person can. 
A repository, a consequence, a long sentence, an ongoing story. 
The generous current cut through by a party boat shouting 
wooo! wooo! wooooooo! wooo! 
emitting an obscene light 
waving at whatever will wave back.

It was winter. The opposite of burning,
which is also burning.
My banner displayed clock parts,
a cup of wine, a worm eating its opposite head.
My motto was Try to Be Responsible,
but every new moon was a sacrificial moon.
Thirteen paving slabs were flipped into the river. 
The extra light of spring threw our business
into relief. My banner displayed a sunburst,
a bloodied hand dropping a knife, and
in the other hand an avocado withholding
its stone. War would soon come but not
for us, and this became our motto, Not for Us.
Then a crime in our community led to anger.
Gossip gathered the truth into a ball;
paperwork was spoiled; a man was removed
from the yellow light of the barn.
We heard his sobs coming from the orchard,
and these were a source of comfort. 
Summer roused lanterns of dust under doorways,
though a vinegar taste kept the air difficult.
Antifa angels bathed their eyes in milk,
as horses refused riders. The timid among us
signed petitions swearing that when the time came
we would know it by the rocks in our hands.
I made a banner for the protests to come
depicting the planting of milk teeth,
the burning of a noose, a stadium left empty. 
Autumn was just my luck. I could not stomach
the broth I boiled, and slept badly.
Arguments I won in my head lost direction
when formed out loud. The riots continued
but quietly now, indoors.
It was a time for manifestos, though the wrongs
were too many for anything less than a lake.
Friends kept the counsel of friends.
In the yellow light of the barn we tried to write
sentences each other would like, or not desire
to alter. Together we designed a quilt depicting
the wolf taking scent, water moving quickly,
the sign of the errant cloud and alphabet,
a baby resisting sleep, a worm eating
its opposite head, only this time surrounded
by snow, which hasn’t stopped falling since
Thursday, the name we gave to our child.

When, sticky with pink barbe à papa,

Resembled the crazy-maze passage of our caroming bumper car,
We were met by a stream of sangliers —

Cavillargues. The acres of Cavillus, perhaps. 
The hairy pigs had emigrated, perhaps from the Caucasus,
And no doubt had settled the Val de Tave long before Cavillus
Arrived to begin gentrification.
He wandered from the marble steps of the Maison Carrée,
Perhaps having paid obeisance to Roman gods and governors,
Perhaps uncertain from an encounter with the local plonk,
And les sangliers came out to give him a thrill,

Choice by extinction sounded ominous
to Yanks like us — we all remembered the war.
But that was just Herr Schreiff’s personal English.
We were on the same side now, building the thing,
the thing,
the VTOL fighter. What’s today? There must be
some big dates coming up, historic dates.
He’d say, Cold hands frog heart, and it became a gag
among the engineers: Soft hands wombat heart,
Sweaty hands lawnmower heart. The docs in this place
want to put in a pacemaker; I said no,
I’m not in this for the long run. 
On his birthday Schreiff brought in three bottles of schnapps
and we sat around half pickled trying to do the
do the
debug the navigation. What a fright?
Patty —     Debbie —    Susan called, wanted to know
could she bring me anything. I told her, My old brain.
I used to be smart, you know? I’m assuming someone
is in charge of the dates, the historic dates. 
Schreiff had worked for Heinkel during the war,
on those last-ditch plywood jet fighters
that kept disintegrating in midair
and killing their precious test pilots.
Ah Christ, look at this mess! Where’s the thing,
the thing
to call the nurse? Someone needs to deal
with those important dates, it’s all so disorganized.

Two men share
one tooth. From 
one tooth the men
predict the world.

Two men and one
tooth is not a problem. 
One man is wide
and one man is sober. 
Sometimes the men are
the same. Little tooth 
is the light of the
orchard. From 
it all things are
made up. Once 
the two men lost
the tooth and every 
one disappeared.
No one was angry 
because no one was
there. The men 
found the tooth
when the tooth 
started laughing.
The men said what 
is that noise and
the world came 
back on. They told
the tooth that’s not 
funny but it was
very funny. One 
man swallowed
the tooth and put 
on all the sad
knowledge. 
He wanted to
punish the tooth 
but the tooth
punished him. It 
lasted three hours
and then he threw 
up. The two men
live in a cave with 
bay windows. To
be in love is so 
solemn think the
two men once 
a year. The tooth
never thinks any

What if it didn’t matter how much
you trod over the body of your mother, what happened
when you were younger, how you tried forgetting
and forgot to forgive. Something has to hold you: numbers, columns,
cards to swipe, books to shelve, 
pints to pour. A life filled with fixed wings, with hard grasps,
with the grateful. What’s worth keeping?
Not the sad boy who blamed you for all the ways he was broken.
Not the man’s name on the wing, but
why not the battered wing itself. Why not the woman thinking.
Why not the river below, its lips wet, footprints animal.

Over the years they hunted,
the wayward apprentice watchmakers,
the disappointing sons who transformed
their surnames, hunted over acres
of hinges, cogs, calluses, hidden whiskey,
mustaches a breath from feral,
poured an ocean of fortune
into fabrications of brass and iron,
spent entire seasons strumming
massive harps of wire into perfect
calibrations of invisibility,
prayed to the gods of adjustable mirrors,
cursed the gods of temperamental gaslights,
broke the legs of imitators and thieves,
chewed holes in each other’s pockets,
harnessed nightmares of giant silver hoops
making endless passes over the bodies
of the dead, hoisted high a cenotaph
for hundreds of sacrificed rabbits,
breathed miles of delicate thread
into the lost labyrinths of their lungs,
all to make a woman float
to make a woman float
and none of them ever thought
of simply asking her.

Six years ago, the big museum sold eight famous paintings

Gustave Caillebotte’s Man at His Bath.
Now it’s hip to have a print of it,
and whenever I see one hung for decoration,
I’m almost certain that this is what Caillebotte
had in mind when he broke out the oils
in 1884: some twenty-first-century bitch in Boston
catching a glimpse of a framed reproduction,
recollecting a study about how washing oneself may induce
a sense of culpability. What I remember 
is he insisted I clean before leaving. That, and he was
trying to be dreamlike. He took my jaw in his hand
and said in the next life, we’ll really be together,
and the clamp in his voice made me almost
certain he knew something I did not. Now I eat right,
train hard, get my shots. This life — I’m angling

After Nadia Reid



This spirit she came upon me as I slept — in such a way
my life or yours could come to be so thoroughly owned — 
she was reckless — I knew she would make me run away
with her — I said spirit, slow down — but the spirit wanted
to ride — but I am so afraid, I said — I have all this tenderness
to impart — but the tenderness is not mine to give away — 
but all your tenderness is your own tenderness, said the spirit — 
it is not, I said — why then did you give it all away? — I did
not give it away — then it is yours to give away — the spirit
riddled like this — if in her arms I read a story — if out of her
arms I had the choice to write one but I chose not — chose not
because I did not know where I was going — because my path
broke down & I had this choice — stay or split — if I knew that
were I to split one part of me would become a ghost — if I did
not know yet which part — if the voice calling me out asked me
to describe the splitting & I did — if I said it was like smoke
spiraling outwards — it was like smoke lifting off me taking on
form & leaving me — if  it was like a delicate girl I never met
but dreamed of — if it was like the flags of my youth fluttering,
far out at sea — like breathing out a breath you will never take
back in — but you know you can never take any breath back in — 
if I saw her outside of myself & mourned her like I have mourned
no other loss — if I knew it was both a miracle & the most terrible
tragedy — to open up — release a flame — watch the flame go — 
have you seen it? A flame that can ride water — she was my
daughter & if I could I would send her to you, if I sent her to you
would you take her? Listen, I ran this out of me because I knew
it would burn me down — my trainers press the ground & lift up
again — I saw myself on my back in high grass in high summer
with everything coming to me — how this ghost left me & printed
a new person all over me — I could peel her off or live like this — 
I cried — one or both will destroy me! — the spirit called it fate but
I knew it was just drama — I will never know why a good person must die — 
fate does not exist I said, but every door I opened showed yes yes yes — I shut each one & locked it — checked the locks
three times — went back & checked them again — shook them to be
sure — drew hearts round the keyholes so the spirit would know
I loved her — it wasn’t — it was never — that I didn’t love her —

What can I tell you? It was a summer that seemed to be
making history — their personal history — almost before
it began, and they stood back slightly, still in it, but
observing it, saying “the summer this,” “the summer that,”
all the while it was going on. They became obsessed with
a fountain, for example, one they walked past each day,
how abundantly it would reach upwards and yet be pouring
back down itself the whole time — all winter this fountain
had been dry, not saying a word. What more can I tell you?
Oh, everything — like how they would walk home in
the evenings when the light was soft, anything bad sliding
off them, and they would feel owned, completely owned,
in a good way, by the air, which would touch them constantly,
sometimes urgently, sometimes lightly, just to let them know
it was there, and they would think maybe this is what being
alive is, when they saw how complicated a tree was and how
it wanted them looking at it and saying this, how the color
of a particular flower at this particular moment was redder
even than the life force, whatever that is, if you could open
it up and get right down inside it, if you could put your mouth
to it and become as red as that rose even, it was still redder
than that, and they wouldn’t know what to do with themselves
so they wouldn’t do anything except listen to the songs in their
heads which were sad ones like nearly all good songs and watch
this feeling rolling in, sunshine or rain, we don’t know yet,
it’s a good one, it’s the best one, though it has no name.

How hard it is to sleep
in the middle of a life.
— Audre Lorde



We wake in the middle of a life,                    hungry.
We smear durian            along our mouths, sing soft
death a lullaby. Carcass breath, eros of  licked fingers
and the finest perfume. What is love if  not         rot?
We wear the fruit’s hull as a spiked crown, grinning
in green armor.   Death to the grub, fat in his milky
shuffle! Death to the lawlessness       of dirt! Death
to mud and its false chocolate!   To the bloated sun
we want to slice open and yolk                      all over
the village. We want a sun-drenched           slug feast,
an omelet loosening its folds like hot Jell-O. We want
the marbled fat of steak and all        its swirling pink
galaxies. We want the drool, the gnash, the pluck of
each corn kernel, raw and summer                   swell.
Tears welling up                     oil. Order up! Pickled
cucumbers piled like logs for a fire, like fat limbs we
pepper and succulent                in. Order up: shrimp
chips curling in a porcelain bowl like subway seats.
Grapes peeled from bitter bark — almost translucent,
like eyes we would rather see. Little girl, what do you
leave, leaven              in your sight? Death to the open
eyes of  the dying. Here,           there are so many open
eyes we can’t close each one.          No, we did not say
the steamed eye of a fish. No eyelids fluttering like
no butterfly wings. No purple yam lips. We said eyes.
Still and resolute as a heartbreaker.         Does this break
your heart?                                      Look, we don’t want
to be rude, but seconds, please. Want: globes of oranges
swallowed whole like a basketball or Mars or whatever
planet is the most delicious.                   Slather Saturn!
Ferment Mercury! Lap up its film of dust, yuk sung!
Seconds, thirds, fourths! Meat wool! A bouquet of
chicken feet! A garden of                   melons, monstrous
in their bulge!               Prune back nothing. We purr
in this garden. We comb through berries and come out
so blue. Little girl,                            lasso tofu, the rope
slicing its belly clean. Deep fry a cloud so it tastes like
bitter gourd or your father leaving — the exhaust of
his car, charred. Serenade a snake and slither its tongue
into yours and                           bite. Love! What is love
if  not knotted in garlic? Child, we move through graves
like eels, delicious         with our heads first, our mouths
agape. Our teeth:         little needles to stitch a factory of
everything made in China.      You ask: Are you hungry?
Hunger eats through the air like ozone. You ask: What
does it mean to be rootless? Roots are good to use as
toothpicks. You: How can you wake in the middle of
a life? We shut and open our eyes like the sun shining
on tossed pennies in a forgotten well. Bald copper,
blood. Yu choy bolts                  into roses down here.
While you were sleeping, we woke to the old leaves
of  your backyard shed and ate that and one of your
lost flip-flops too. In a future life, we saw rats overtake
a supermarket with so much milk, we turned opaque.
We wake to something boiling. We wake to wash dirt
from lettuce, to blossom into your face. Aphids along
the lashes. Little girl, don’t forget              to take care
of  the chickens, squawking in their mess and stench.
Did our mouths buckle                                at the sight
of  you devouring slice                after slice of  pizza and
the greasy box too? Does this frontier swoon for you?
It’s time to wake up. Wake the tapeworm who loves
his home. Wake the ants,                  let them do-si-do
a spoonful of  peanut butter. Tell us, little girl, are you
hungry, awake,                               astonished enough?

something about it has changed

recently     has changed     since the last time we talked     the shell has opened, and — 

calm down      please      I’m about to tell you     I’ve waited years to tell you     how?     how could I have called you?     I don’t know where you live: I don’t even know your name!

I spend an hour with it every morning      and if the weather’s mild, after they’ve gone to bed, I take it out at night, lie on my back in the grass, hold the jar on my chest, and together we watch the metallic flower petals spin at each other in that dangerous memory of  heaven, or the past    please     don’t cry    no one’s to blame     and nothing’s ruined, nothing’s wrong      there’s no discomfort      there seems to be no pain     there’s only time, letting something looser     and I’ve made the preparations     it will die when I die

bed as stiff as metal and a cardboard
breakfast of cardboard bread and eggs and between us
we talked cardboard, shirts from the cleaners with sheets of
cardboard we drew on, cardboard soles in ruined shoes
we both wore when we were children, cardboard hats,
cardboard to lie on listening to outdoor concerts
and cardboard masks we made with scissors and crayon
for costume dances, balls is what we called them
as if we were art students in Paris about to
swim in the nearest fountain.  Though what I want to
say is the bees were too busy to do us any
harm and it was packs of wild dogs, not swarms
of bees, that terrified me (Larry, too) except for one
occasion when I pushed the wrong end of an old
broom into a hive of yellow jackets on the underside
of a low-lying garage roof and an angry swarm chased
me through the yard and over a fence hating
any form of criminal intrusion, urban renewal, or
gentrification, I who couldn’t resist intrusions,
who never could, omnivorous as I was, living on
apples and bananas as well as baby lamb chops,
who ran like hell that day (Larry, too)
for we in our separate ways didn’t want to be
paralyzed then eaten by larvae, none of us dead ones did.

Outside the room where you have lived a long time
Are other rooms, another building, just like yours. 
Each night a ship sails past, wider than the building, taller than the highest church.
And though the passengers would like to visit the city,
No one in the city ever boards the ship. Would you? 
Each night this spectacle is seen by you.
The street surveyed,
The air inhaled. 
Grapes from the west,
Cinnamon from the east —  
If I’ve employed too liberally the passive voice,
Remember it’s the thoughts,
The feelings that are of consequence here,
Not the one who feels them. 
 
2  
Shall we walk to the market?
You could walk there blind, like Gloucester, smelling your way. 
Shall we stop for coffee? Which café?
The one that’s commandeered by women, delicate cups?
Or the one where men preside, baristas in tuxedos, the coffee rich enough for rainy days? 
A window, the desk, a lamp, and a chair — 
You’ve liked the room, you like to rearrange it for winter,
Put things back for spring. 
But you’ve been young for a long time,
An embarrassingly long time.
Look what you wrote!
Remember how much, despite
Your ridiculous behavior, you’ve been loved. 
 
3  
The city never changes, it’s never the same.
Sometimes the inhabitants restore a building, patch it up,
But in a generation they’re dissatisfied, they try again,
Expose the old parts so you see them
Plainly, ruined or not. 
Who schooled you?
What made you scared of change? 
Vividly you remember a child’s body; likewise you remember a man’s.
You woke up one morning,
There you were, a stinking adult. 
What happened between? What will it be like,
You’ve seen the images, to watch your body spoiling
From the inside out, your lungs, your arms,
The muscles in your face —  
Look out the window,
Choose a single brick.
Once, a long time ago, the city was old. 
 
4  
Clouds desire the sky, the sky the sun. The wave
Desires the land on which it trembles,
Repeating the same question, day after day —  Am I allowed to ask for what I want? 
And every day the land responds, Of course you’re allowed. You’re allowed to be angry, to rail,
You’re allowed to curse the God who put you here. 
I’ve buried many people, old people, young people.
I’ve buried children while their parents wept beside the grave. 
But I’ve also seen miracles.
Remember when they told you
You might die? You didn’t, you’re alive.
And every month since then, each minute, every second is a miracle. 
What happens next you cannot know.
Is it better or worse to live longer?
Really the words better and worse do not obtain.",James Longenbach,"Living,Growing Old,The Body,The Mind,Time & Brevity,Youth,Social Commentaries,Cities & Urban Life"

                ","
it started with the first time
i opened the closet in my new
bedroom. paper flecks bursting from
behind the door. they had been waiting
all millennia. you helped
me pick them from my hair but even
weeks later we’d still find pieces
in between teeth — under tongues — 
on shoulders & lodged beneath fingernails.
you were always so gentle as you’d release
them out the window — same as you’d do
for a spider. when finished with
a rainbow it is the task of the youngest
angel to put it through the paper shredder.
he crouches in the cloud mist — taking
handfuls of the body’s remnants.
he learns not to weep after years of practice.
the first rainbow he shredded was that one
that we tried to follow in your car — 
driving around wet fallen trees — mist
rising from the asphalt. we never did get there
but we did stop for ice cream. you bit
the bottom off the cone. the sound
of the rainbow’s destruction was only a dull
static noise to us down here. i noticed
it but didn’t want to tell you. the next
time i was tearing open what looked like
a credit card offer in the mail & out
came the confetti. we had just stopped finding
it on everything — gushing like an artery
i covered my face until it was through.
mounds upon mounds of color. stole the rake
from my aunt’s shed we had used to rake leaves
in early october before the weather gave
herself over to frost. i resisted the impulse
to make the confetti into piles to leap into.
you were coming over & i wanted to be
clean. the next time we slept together
i transported myself somewhere else as you kissed me.
sat on the collarbone of the rainbow as
it was shred along with my hair. me, with the
thousand-piece body. me, getting blown
away by the first breeze. me, inhaling
the tears of the kneeling angel. i came
back to the room when you knelt,
spitting paper out of your mouth. confetti began to
pour out from behind my lips, miraculously dry.
each time i tried to apologize more came out;
you, naked on the bedroom floor trying to dispose
of the colors as they came. flow mountain spring.
flow slit neck of a pig. flash flood &
flow melted ice cream down to our elbows.
by the time it stopped your fear turned to anger.
slammed the door as you left & there i
was with all this color. i put some in my mouth
but it was too bitter too swallow.
if i don’t kiss anyone this won’t happen again — 
i can keep it a beautiful secret. routine:
each morning removing the piles of cut paper.
when you come over i sometimes find them on your
skin. you don’t notice so i kiss them off
your neck. i’m trying i’m trying.
i peel the rainbows free & roll them up like
yoga mats in the closet. the shredding has
gotten so loud — i ask you if you hear
it & you shake your head, unknowingly.
i can’t stand it — i can’t stand it.
caress this color out of me.

                ","
all the rain came down at once like a dropped bag
of aquarium pebbles. too much for the street to swallow:
all gravel & grit. i feel the saltwater rushing
in my mouth as i hit the shore — sand becoming rice.
the pot on the stove — put on the lid. we read the
back of the bag — bring the water to a boil — it
protests in the clouds. rainwater peeling open
car windows to fill the floor — make mobile your
lakes & the herons will come — don’t feed the birds rice.
my favorite summer storms are the ones
that come too fast. they remind me so much of myself:
gathering their gray hair in a bouquet to beat
against the highway. i think of the times the thunder
would toss geodes at the street until they cracked open,
about dad telling my brother & i to go upstairs
& shut the windows before the storm snuck inside.
the car prayed until it drove on water — ocean barreling
toward us like a great big whale: blueness open & mouth full
of salt. you ask if we should stir the rice & the water
hisses & spits. we often forget about the ghosts
who kneel in pots of water. there’s always a wooden spoon. i keep
mine in the glove box. taking it out, i park the car with
the four-ways on. other monsters slosh past.
we get out on the side of the road. kneeling i plunge
the spoon into the bank: chicken broth & rice.
rain warming our bodies until there’s no
mistaking us from the stove. i burn my feet getting
back into the car. our flesh turns chicken-white & tender.
somewhere in all of this i managed
to drive across the whole unknown ocean — the one
without a name that shows up only when it downpours.
makes tides that eat radar & sailors.
picks rice grains from her teeth.
the other side is not land, but soft rice steaming
& ready. our legs sink in. take a spoonful of me
before i drive home a second time. the sun emerging like
a quartered bell pepper. i’m thinking of
lying in a rain puddle with you & falling apart
into a palm full of cooked rice.

A black sun rises in the West of me & will never set. God of my fathers, sleep like the one sleeping next to me; inert & tenderly coiled. I am so grateful to yóu, that breathes as the dead breathe in their shallow land — barely, below the range of my hearing. That draws in the thin streams of black air & shifts & puts a white arm around me. I want to know, Né, what it is like in the kingdom of the dead where you are. Is the one I fear there with her train of silver hair? Have you seen John, the temples of his glasses duct-taped to the hinge? I know it is not still there; I know everything is in furious motion beneath the black sun & the sky white as chalk —  the torrent of silver hair whipped about her face that woke in the moonlight on the last morning, lucid & fluent, & turned toward my father & said, “I love you,” walking backward on the white road into the white sky toward the white city, black sun clearing the horizon & a wind lifting in the torn leaves like the wind in the wood above Lady’s Walk where I trespassed in spring, singing, Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more, the bluebells hissing like cats & the canopy a violent array, violently outside me in flickering Islamic greens / Spanish grays, the topside / bellyside of milled leaves, the harebells biting their bitter tongues, & raising its head in panic, a juvenile fallow deer stippled with thick white spots. Then someone shouted, “Oy, stay there, you fúck,” Oyé, Whale, & my launces in his side, & I went down the hill with the sweetgrass pulling at me & the spit in my mouth. Né, I cannot sleep. Ever since I lost my little children. I look for their shapes on the ceiling, in the dark, & they are not there. Né, never, no, no, never, never, never, never. There is nothing, Né. Neither the night nor the white city like Conholt in its great estate. Not the hart, nor the furious wood. O,           John, John. I came downstairs still drunk to find you asleep with your head on the hoover, & the hoover still running; half-shaved, the tape on your glasses, your mouth open & the tattered Crombie. Then years later when Oli called & you were, O John. Y am alpha and oo, the firste and the laste, bigynnyng and ende. O,           John, John. No white city as a wijf ourned to hir hosebonde, no voice in the wind, in the (clouds) crying Lo! Y make alle thingis newe. I make all things new. Como una novia adornada para su esposo. Como tu cuerpo en la noche, Né; like this body that pregnancies have raged over & I have loved with my mouth moost feithful and trewe. i              And let him that is athirst come. ii             And let him that heareth say, Come. iii            And let the dawn thunder up in the street while you are sleeping with the first cars sauntering by & the dustmen & women whistling. Lord, I will stand before yóu when yóu wish in death’s little house & yóu will eat my pronoun.
 
•  In that other life that will be ours where there is neither marriage nor children, I may kneel beside you, Mouse, & not know you — our eyes like a golem’s, empty of their own will, but full of hís, the dead Lord at the center of hís dead city. In the days when my glory is stripped from me, & yours from you, & all are made equal — no aesthetic splendor, no charm, no subversive, faithless glances to- ward those I have loved & have loved me; no property, no desire, no variation, no sparrowhawk thrusting through birches in the snow toward the wood, for hé never stepped in a wood, nor saw a harebell easing its frail metaled head, its light pinks & papery blues, through the first tranche of snow in November, nor the gray cere of the plunderer beneath her blue helmet, her single attention, wings volute in air, head w/ beak narrowly ajar in concentration & hunger breaking the line of the fence at the old house in Broadway; in the snow; in the snow that has flattened everything, the bells ringing out, the clouds heaped above the Blackdowns dragging themselves from the earth, headlights on the ridge in the wind groping toward them, the hills featureless, snuffed, white, black, dull, shining w/ no light. No drinking in the afternoon, no dope, no flaring temper. No bed to sleep it off, Mouse, while you draw catkins & piggies & pussybears with gorgeous happy frowns in the cold. No sleep, no flesh to rest in, for there is only day in the white irradiate city where the lamb lights hís terrible mercy in to worldis of worldis, forever & ever & hís government will never fail, for no glory is allowed but hís glory, no bone gouvernance but hís bone gouvernance, no prison camp but hís prison camp, hís plantations, hís will & techne, hís punishment beatings, hís censorship, hís textual criticism, hís forgiveness, hís rehabilitation, O ferdful men, & vnbileueful & cursid & manquelleris. Mouse, on that day, will you turn toward me & will I see in the insubstantial glass of your eyes the memory of these days; myself, father, authority, half chocolate & half steel, still carrying you at six up the hill & down the hill, still playing the Ticklepuss & Crocopotamus, the horn of plenty, salver, lessener of cries, bringer of swallows & dragonflies, the Emperor & Downy Emerald hovering over still waters in the valei of teeris, wolves in the mist in the hills above Antequera where the rocks bared themselves like teeth & you were asleep on my chest with fine alabaster eyelids & eyelashes plashed with droplets of dew? Where I said, “Shhhhhh, close your eyes & imagine that you’re a water reed, Mouse,” & I blew on you & that was the wind & then my hand was a snail wandering over your eyelids & the nape of your neck & last of all it rained & that was my fingers going pitter-pat upon the pinnacles of your head. The days fade through our slow parting; your mother grows ambivalent. Little accident, in the stillness of the earth there is no life; the harebell reaches its root into death & the waters flow down until the rock is dry. I wanted more than I was given, & found in betrayal a churning courage. Torchlight in the garden where we make our choice. The will that flickers. My loss. Our bliss. Mouse, on the last day, remember this.
 
•  Lying with you, Né, in the sun, in the (clouds) half-listening to the Senegalese preacher two mornings after the riots when they ran Mame Mbaye down to the gutter & wishing you would go buy your mutes & play again, here, in silence, —  for them & for me & yourself & the polis —  Bach’s Suiten für Violoncello No. 1. To watch in dumb show the formal motions that reify language & music — the flesh; your shoulder & forearm & wrist & lightly-draped fingers one continuous dependent assemblage flowing south to the river at Arganzuela & the chuckling magpies. There is an authority in you, when you play, that is different from the authority of the whap | whap of rotor blades overhead; control that is liberation, a concentration that is neither at one point nor diffuse, like the globes of light hovering over the lampposts in your myopia last night; wandering across the river, the madrileños also entonados swaying like palm fronds in the wind; then the dark, & our one body with its artifacts of pregnancy & loss. An authority that is different from the authority of the Lord in hís dead city, hís kingdom that has no contiguity with ours, no conformitá, the streets empty of opposition & neither wind nor rain; nor thunder, nor tears. Now a thin sun is dwelling in the wind. I wd like to reach out to you in its cold light & pull the shape of your body into mine; put my tongue against your eyes so I can taste what it is you see through them; the restaurant opening, the crisp cloths. Even the polis with their holsters & war clubs looking on carefully & asexually like angels come to lie with the daughters of men. A kestrel on a lamppost strips the bascinet from a cricket with slow, considerate motions: lovely rare flame. Have they buried Mame Mbaye? They are erasing a name from the wall & the quarter is pacified. Clouds rise above Guadarrama, Somosierra, above the meseta like kites. The picoletos shift from foot to foot in long black boots. Bells bleat — lambs; Alsatians on leashes. The bougainvillea —  glad to bring us at last the first trace of its colors — flaunts a breathless restraint.

Women with electric-pink hoofs that drag 
in the slow churn of the intersection. Clog
the sidewalks. Metastasize along the corridor
of Main Street. They have come to settle 
around the bend of this corner. Pose
under carnival-like car lights at just nine-thirty.
Note: It ain’t even prime time & they got all that  good-good going on sale. The gully accordion,
their arms sway in & out of tempo with traffic.
They stagger in & out of the busted frame of Pop’s 
Grocery neon-blue open sign. Their smoke-thin throats
glitter when they slip into the ringing center of the motel lobby.
Strangled light bubbles & soaps along their jaws like melted crayons 
through the Plexiglas. A rush of shade strains
against their nylon-clamped thighs, rides up their hips
& dangles around their soft bellies as they saunter on in. 
They be harvested sounds for the replay later this evening.
When they got to make it do what it do. When they got to
cash they own checks. Trace dollar signs into ceilings — signals 
cut with their zirconia-encrusted toes.
Giggle & grunt at all the right moments

this bo’y is different from hers
bo’y has too much and not enough flesh to be her
the biology of a bo’y is just
bo’y will only ever be a bo’y 
the bo’y is Black
so the bo’y is and will only ever be a bo’y
the bo’y couldn’t be a man if it tried
the bo’y tried 
the bo’y feels empty
the bo’y feels like it will only ever be empty
the bo’y feels that it will never hold the weight of another bo’y inside of it
no matter how many ds fit inside the bo’y 
the bo’y is a hollow facade
it attempts a convincing veneer
bo’y dresses — what hips on the bo’y
bo’y paints its face — what lips on the bo’y
bo’y adorns itself with labels written for lovelier frames
what a beautiful bo’y
still a bo’y
but a fierce bo’y now
a royal bo’y now
a bo’y worthy of  being called queen
what a dazzling ruse
to turn a bo’y into a lie everyone loves to look at 
the bo’y looks at itself
the bo’y sees all the gawking at its gloss
the bo’y hears all the masses asking for its missing
the bo’y offers all of its letters
— ‘ b ’ for the birth
— ‘ o ’ for the operation
— ‘ y ’ for the lack left in its genes
what this bo’y would abandon
for the risk of  being real 
the bo’y is real
enough and too much
existing as its own erasure
— what an elusive d —
evading removal
avoiding recognition
leaving just a bo’y 
that is never lost
but can’t be found

the unified field 
It wasn’t that there was anything to say
that would stop him from feeling this way — the X
of himself splayed out in space 
where gravity was weakest. He and his father
and talkative mother
suffering tiny strokes that took away 
this syllable from this word, that syllable
from that, all this lay
in one pan of the balance scale 
while in the other there was nothing but dark matter
and the cosmic inconsequence
of his literal physical heart beating. 
And then the unified field, faced with its own emptiness,
bent down to his chest as if to listen. 
 
a toast to pavlov’s dogs  
Oh Leash held by a hand I can’t see, here
in the laboratory where nothing can change
and where yips and bites are fine-tuned to the pack’s mentality, 
am I one of his dogs, the three-legged one that knows nothing
of my lack except for how I bark, growl,
and whine to be let in? Am I the salivating triangle 
guided only by my nose that keeps me
on the move in my limping trot away from you, Leash, yanking
me back from all the filth I want to shove my nose in? 
Why won’t you let me go free? The sad gestures
of our growing intimacy is a reflex we
can’t escape or express: sometimes, emotion is just mange. 
So Leash, here’s a toast to my lab pals: August, Fast One,
Pretty Little Lady, Joy, Beauty, MiLord, Clown.  
 
the judgment after the last  
What would we like to see happen?
Would we like to drive nails into our hands?
Would the shame engulfing us like flame 
on a computer screen make us understand
that throwing a match into the Grand Canyon
while snapping a selfie, and never once thinking 
how far that match falls, is the original sin
that a donkey’s ears twitching
as we ride it to the bottom reveal as the truth 
about our consciences? How many nails
will we need? Go to the movies, do research,
be the Regulator forced to kill kill kill 
and that’s when we’ll find out just who we are
or if there’s anything like “who” anymore.  
 
mission  
It’s not simply that the palm trees are on fire
but that they waver up more fire than fire,
brighter and harsher and more intoxicating 
than the flames spreading ever thought of being — 
the thick black smoke turning noon to midnight
rears up in a wall that nobody can see 
over or around or through even as this nobody
comes crashing through the screen
right into my living room: poor nobody! In this loneliest of times, 
he tells me how much he loves me, how his lack
and mine feel somehow the same and that the flames
crawling over him have become his mission: 
burning, he erects a burning house of smoke
we can neither live in or abandon.  
 
sunday is never the last day of the week  
Using zip ties and Velcro to strap on a homemade bomb,
who is to blame, who should have told us
that on the far side of the screen in this Sunday calm 
our generation has had its time? In that corner
where we slept together so many nights, yes, in that corner where
the bed of the dead lovers has been put out with all the other 
Monday morning trash, there are always two doors
opening and closing as one of us goes out and the other comes in.
Why couldn’t we show our love for one another 
the way the void dissolves into the zero? Why did the animal
grafted to the human find such satisfaction in explosions? Darkness
to darkness, ashes to ashes, the animal to the human, 
why shouldn’t we take pleasure where and when we can — 
provided this is pleasure, provided that the body isn’t null.  
 
last rites  
Even if the suit they dress me in for my funeral
is dry-cleaned at Perfection Laundry, then washed
and washed in the blood of the lamb, the knees 
will still be muddy from kneeling down, the sleeves,
mismatched, will tell their own threadbare tale
about the breath of life breathed into tabletop dust. 
What would the naked man and woman and talking snake say
about the god who no longer remembers if they’re forgiven
or not? Listening as a kid to the old stories, 
there were never enough beanstalks and giants
and Jacks. Now, the pallbearers pick up my coffin,
they carry me out to the ruined cathedral where the saints’ 
wooden faces, frozen in their homely expressions of grace,
are shadowed by flocks of  blackbirds whirling past.  
 
coda: the hunger artist as a senior citizen  
Nowadays, in my cage
in old straw, where
my brother keeper 
forgets to come feed me anymore,
at last I’m fasting for its own sake,
not to break records I’ve broken 
a thousand times before.
Besides, nothing could be easier
than to starve forever 
if the food they keep on
giving you makes you sick.
This hunger is a moment’s 
vision that will persist
in a pillar of radiant house dust.

When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best.... They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.

They woke him up by pissing in his face. He opened his mouth

Scott and Steve: the Leader brothers, celebrating a night at Fenway,
where the Sox beat the Indians and a rookie named Rodríguez spun
the seams on his changeup to hypnotize the Tribe. Later that night,
Steve urinated on the door of his cell, and Scott told the cops why
they did it: Donald Trump was right. All these illegals need to be deported. 
He was a Mexican in a sleeping bag outside JFK station on a night
in August, so they called him a wetback and emptied their bladders
in his hair. In court, the lawyers spoke his name: Guillermo Rodríguez,
immigrant with papers, crop-picker in the fields, trader of bottles
and cans collected in his cart. Two strangers squashed the cartilage
in his nose like a can drained of beer. In dreams, he would remember
the shoes digging into his ribcage, the pole raked repeatedly across
his cheekbones and upraised knuckles, the high-five over his body.  Donald Trump was right, said Scott. And Trump said: The people

                ","



For  Jack Agüeros (1934–2014)



I was eight when the blackout struck and the lights died all across the city
like a massacre of fireflies. In the projects of Brooklyn, I steered myself
to 14F, fingers spread against the cool tiles of the hallway, past the concrete
and chicken-wire terrace where I once burnt ants with a magnifying glass. 
Many years later, at the Chinese restaurant uptown, Jack said: They got  any flan here? He was my first poet. I had seen the fireflies in his sonnets
blink and float away: Fulano the philosopher in the unemployment line;
Blanco the painter, painting in the madhouse; Monterosa the dealer killed
by shotgun in a bar on Avenue A; his mother the seamstress and the quick
needle of her sewing machine; Jack the moving man, his hands sliced raw.
He stacked his apartment with dictionaries in three languages. I knew
the raconteur’s grin with every tale: Raúl Juliá is a friend of mine: a Puerto Rican playing Macbeth. He took 14 curtain calls on opening night. 
Maybe he would tell me now that flan was not Puerto Rican, or Mexican,
or Spanish, but Chinese, invented by a trembling cook to satisfy the palate
of an emperor in the Ming Dynasty. No flan, Jack, I said. This is a Chinese  restaurant. Two minutes later, he said: They got any flan? I showed him
the dog-eared and fingerprinted menu. No flan, I said. When the waiter
unfurled his pad, Jack said to him: You got flan? He sang this song for an hour.
The egg roll was not flan. The fried rice was not flan. The fortune cookie
was not flan. Can we get some flan? he said. Goddammit, Jack, I said. 
The poets crowded into the bar, striding to the mic. Jack stood with poem
in hand, read the title, tilted his head and said it again, studied the page
as if the words shriveled up like ants burnt under a magnifying glass,
then sat down. I witnessed the massacre of fireflies. A few of us clapped,
not knowing what to do with our hands, staring at the sonneteer who lost
all his quatrains and couplets in the denim jacket he left on the subway,
the words of Fulano still waiting on the unemployment line: The faster  you spin, the stiller you look. / There’s something to learn in that, but what? 
After the diagnosis, I handed Jack a book of poems. He dangled the book
upside down like a stiff mouse by the tail, something we would sniff  behind
the refrigerator. I wanted sonnets. Jack kept singing the chorus of a song: Get me to the church. Get me to the church. Get me to the church on time.  
At the end, I leaned over Jack’s bed to read his own poem in his ear, but some
words come home after the blackout, fingers crawling on the wall. I know
what I should have said at the Chinese restaurant: Jack, let’s get some flan.
We should have braved the subway at rush hour, straphangers rocking
all the way to 14th Street and 8th Avenue, to La Taza de Oro, gone now
like Jack, for rice and beans, squid in its own ink, café con leche y flan,
Jack: a spoonful of flan for you after all the years of sonnets and bread
for me, the steam rising when your hands cracked the crust at the table.

Poverty is black ice.
— Naomi Ayala



You leave me sleeping in the dark. You kiss me and I stir,
fingers in your hair, eyes open, unseeing. You leave me asleep
every morning, commuting to the school in the city at sunrise. 
The landlord’s driveway, a muddy creek, ices over hard after
the freezing rain clatters all night. Your feet fly up, your head
slamming the ground, an eclipse of the sun flooding your eyes.
You sleep under the car. No one knows how long you sleep. 
You awake with a hundred ice picks stabbing your eardrums.
You awake, coat and hair soaked, and somehow drive to school.
You remember to turn left at the Smith & Wesson factory.
The other teachers lead you by the elbow to Mercy Hospital,
where you pause when the nurse asks your name, where you claim
your pain level is a four, and they slide you into the white coffin
of an MRI machine. You hold your breath. They film your brain.  Concussion: the word we use for the boxer plunging face-first
to the canvas after the uppercut blindsided him, not the teacher
commuting to school at sunrise in a Subaru Crosstrek. Yet, you would
drive, ears hammering as they hammer in the purgatory of the MRI. 
A week before, Isabela came to you in the classroom and said: Miss, I cannot sleep. Three days, I cannot sleep. Her boyfriend called
at 2 am, and she did not pick up. At 3 am, a single shot to the head
put him to sleep, and he will sleep forever, his body hidden beneath
a car in a parking lot on Maple Street, the cops, the television cameras,
the neighbors all gathering at the yellow-tape carnival of his corpse. 
You said to Isabela: Take this journal. Write it down. You don’t have to show me. You don’t have to show anyone. On the cover of the journal
you bought at the drugstore was the word: Dream. Isabela sat there
in your classroom, at your desk, pencil waving in furious circles.
By lunchtime, as her friends slapped each other, Isabela slept,
head on the desk, face pressed against the pages of the journal. 
This is why I watch you sleep at 3 am, when the sleeping pills fail
to quell the strike meeting in my brain. This is why I say to you,
when you kiss me in my sleep: Don’t go. Don’t go. You have to go.

The landlord says we have to go. On the night the thermostat read seventeen
below zero, and there was no heat on the first floor, the Massachusetts State
Sanitary Code appeared in the landlord’s in-box like a spirit tapping bony
knuckles on his window, and a letter appeared in the landlord’s in-box
like a spirit scratching the words no rent in the frost on his window,
and the landlord’s mouth foamed as if he’d swallowed detergent,
and the foam froze on his beard, and the landlord’s plumber laid
twenty-four feet of baseboard on the first floor, and now we have to go. 
The landlord keeps his purple vintage 1976 Monte Carlo parked at the edge
of the driveway, purple inside and out, paint job and upholstery purple,
the color of emperors. The mad emperor Caligula assassinated his cousin,
jealous of his purple cloak, and the mad emperor’s mouth foamed
as if he’d swallowed detergent, and the foam froze on his beard. 
The neighbors report a moose sighting today. The moose charges from the woods,
mad as an emperor jealous of a purple cloak, sees the purple vintage
1976 Monte Carlo as another moose, and rams Caligula’s chariot with
his bristling antlers, kicking the car the way a teenager high on detergent
T-boned my leased Toyota Corolla two weeks ago, and so the moose claims
his territory, this land without a gas station or a movie theater or a pizza joint
or a doctor’s office, and gallops back into the woods, snorting foam. 
Now come the hunters tracking the moose, crossbows bristling since crossbow
season is upon us, their vision blurred by a night of Red Bull and detergent,
and see the purple vintage 1976 Monte Carlo as a moose, firing volley
after volley of arrows into the windshield, and the talisman of the air freshener
hanging from the rearview mirror does not keep the glass from exploding,
and the jumper cables coiled in the back seat do not rise magically like electric
eels, and the hunters explode in a cry of huzzah, waving their crossbows
as if their arrows thumped the hump of Richard the hunchback king. 
The purple vintage 1976 Monte Carlo is a dead moose, tow truck dragging
away the carcass to a round of applause in my brain. The landlord will snort
and foam, demanding to know why there is nothing left but his mutilated
vanity plate stamped with the year 1976, and I will speak to him in Brooklynese,
palms turned upward in the universal gesture of the uncooperative witness.
He will keep my security deposit, his territory without a gas station
or a movie theater or a pizza joint or a doctor’s office. I say huzzah.

I close my eyes and see him windmilling his arms as he plummets from
the Mystic Tobin Bridge, to prove me wrong, to show me he was good,
to atone for sins like seeds in the lopsided apple of his heart, but mostly

I hated the 111 bus, sweltering in my suit and tie with the crowd in the aisle,
waiting to hit a bump on the Mystic Tobin Bridge so my head would finally
burst through the ceiling like a giraffe on a circus train. I hated the 111 bus
after eviction day in Chelsea District Court, translating the landlords and judges
into Spanish so the tenants knew they had to stuff their clothing into garbage
bags and steal away again, away from the 40-watt squint that followed them
everywhere, that followed me because I stood beside them in court. I would
daydream in the humidity of the bus, a basketball hero, flipping the balled-up
pages of the law into the wastebasket at the office as the legal aid lawyers
chanted my name. I hated the 111 bus. I had to take a taxicab that day.  What the hell you doing here? said the driver of the cab to me in my suit
and tie. You gotta be careful in this neighborhood. There’s a lotta Josés around here. The driver’s great-grandfather staggered off a boat so his
great-grandson could one day drive me across the Mystic Tobin Bridge,
but there was no room in the taxi for chalk and a blackboard. He could
hear the sawing of my breath as I leaned into his ear, past the bulletproof
barricade somehow missing, and said: I’m a José. I could see the 40-watt
squint in his rearview mirror. I’m Puerto Rican, I said. It was exactly
5 pm, and we were stuck in traffic in a taxi on the Mystic Tobin Bridge.

I had my first surgery when I was eighteen. No, seven. No. I had my first surgery when I was thirty-five. No, when I was forty-seven. I almost had my first surgery today. The doctor drew an all-seeing eye around my wound to diagram the length and width of the scar with a purple magic marker. To be honest, I had my first surgery when they pulled me deadfirst headfirst from between my mother’s thighs. But I don’t remember that one; the separation of my flesh from the source of all I’d known. Muddy vessel, crumbling temple.
This carved body, overgrown garden, nest of the narcotic.
 
 

 
 
My first ten years were mostly marked by my relentless pursuit to not look pregnant when I went out in public. One of my goals each day was to not have someone ask me in public — hopeful look in their gesturing gaze, so excited by the prospect of a coming Christmas
miracle,
“Are you    ...?”
and to have to shatter their hopes of Dream Baby, and simultaneously begin the Emotional Labor of soothing their embarrassment after hearing, “No.” Because a woman with a swollen or distended abdomen can only mean one thing. And that thing is always joyous and awaited with excited anticipation. A woman with a distended abdomen couldn’t possibly be dealing on the daily with something gone terribly awry. Couldn’t possibly be engaged in an ongoing war for her body, a custody battle for her own self. A woman’s swollen belly is everybody’s Good News, everybody’s Business.
So that’s how I spent five years in my thirties: running around evading expectations my deceptive uterus induced in family, friends, and rank fucking strangers.

Everyone is invested in policing the Black body. Yes, even you. And there’s a particularly virulent investment in the surveillance and policing of the Black Woman (née “Female”) Body.

I have hidden your lost teeth in the net of all my famous hair
And with foresight promised your umbilicus 
To several minor gods. I paid your fee in fawn skin
& the lightest fringe of tissue, all the quiet noons assembled, 
In yard stars & the light of phosphorescent pens,
The dioramas that it takes to fill lacunae, in ancestral knots 
That tell the story of our humble people: watchmakers,
Mainly, ventriloquists & scholars of quintessence, 
Amateur lifeguards I meant to surpass. How I loved
My green & distant futures! But I love you more 
From late Holocene out to the farthest buoy, unto
Blackmail & a verb that means renouncing Christ 
Or else describes the path of sap before it’s amber,
Before it dimples, just a little, to collect —

After Thomas Hardy



The milkmaids say Pray for their speech is reserved, fixed here in circles of opalized light. 
Presenting themselves without fancy or choice chapped hands on the full udder’s verge, 
y’know — cream-skinned, gathering toad spume on skirts relentlessly cracking the snails underfoot — 
a century later & more their compeers bow heads to these luminous fields made of ether, 
of blue & extravagant air, calling up with the same nimble fingers their ciphered familiars, 
girl-souls at large in a nonhuman hour. Speaking their argot & screen-practiced moue. 
Not to you, with your paper, your man-heavy shoes, untouched by the mulch of the digital yard! 
They only gaze rapt at threshold, milk spilled. No purchase for you here, Sir, & no clue —

It burns up all the grass too, and breaks the stones, so tremendous is its noxious influence.
— Pliny the Elder, “Natural History”



On a blood- or honey-colored moon at midnight & no 60-watt abuzz. With
Sirius ascendant. From a dunghill’s punk egg hatched 
By toad or serpent. From cold gland & pillaged crib, from ruined sluice,
Bible comics & potshots at swallows. From the Ring of Fire, the Zipper, 
The Nighthawk with her victims taloned upside down. From pistis to gnosis
To the midway where they draw a bead on cardboard sheikhs. From no harvest. 
From no temperate father. From years borne down tainted water
& all we failed to mark in frequencies cranked up, from 
How laughing we cast our own forfeit. O well —
It’s cinch your boots up now, it’s shoulder to the wheel, it’s soldier on 
To lay coins on the fang marks & stand already spent,
Condemned for what we wrongly thought exhaustion. 
Comes now the bright arrival, comes the pageant rain of ashes:
The seal torn & tablets fixed but still impossible to read.

                    The Parable of Perfect Silence
                ","
Today I woke and believed in nothing.
A grief at once intimate and unfelt,
like the death of a good friend’s dog.  
Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue
I praise the day.
I don’t mean merely some mythical, isolate instant
like the mindless mindfulness specialist
who at the terminal cancer convention
(not that it was called that)
exhorted the new year’s crop of slaughters
(ditto)
to “taste” the day, this one unreplicable instant of being alive.
(The chicken glistened.)
Nor do I mean a day devoid of past and future
as craved that great craze of minds and times Fernando Pessoa,
who wanted not “the present” but reality itself,
things in their thingness rather than the time that measures them.
Time is in the table at which I sit and in the words I type.
In the red-checked shirt my father’s mother used to wear
when she was gardening and which I kept
because it held her smell (though it does no longer)
there is still plenty of time.  
Two murderers keep their minds alive
while they wait to die.
They talk through slots in their doors
of whatever mercy or misery
the magazine has ordained for the day — 
the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, say,
ten signs that a relationship is on the rocks.
When their communion flags, as communions will,
they rekindle it with personal revelations, philosophical digressions,
humor. This is a true story,
one of them says sometimes by way of preface,
as if that gave the moment more gravity,
asked of the listener a different attention,
at once resisted and reinforced an order
wherein every hour has its sound, every day its grace,
and every death is by design.  
“Love is possible for anyone,” I hear the TV talk-show host say,
which is true in the way most things in this life are true,
which is to say, false,
unless and until the nullifying, catalyzing death is felt.
Love is possible for anyone
because it is equally impossible for everyone.
To be is to be confronted with a void,
a blankness, a blackness that both appeals and appalls.
Once known — known by the void, I mean — one has three choices.
Walk away, and unlearn the instinct of awe.
Walk along, and learn to believe that awe asks nothing of you.
Are you with me, love?   
(For love read faith.)   
Naked once and after a rat, my father cried, “Die, vermin, die!”
banging the broomstick over and over on the floor
so incorrigibly dirty it might as well have been the earth itself.
This is my mother’s story, though I was there, I’m told,
and no small part of the pandemonium.
We were five souls crammed into one life,
and so incorrigibly poor — or was that fear? — we all slept in one room
and shared one great big chester drawers, as we called it,
and not with irony but in earnest ignorance,
just as like meant lack, as in
“How much do you like bein’ done with your chemo?”
and just as I and every other child I knew,
before we tucked into our lemon meringue pie,
solemnly wiped the calf slobbers off.
Ah, local color, peasant levity, the language fuming and steaming
rich as the mist of rot that rises off the compost heap
(“kitchen midden,” you might hear an old Scot still say).
When do we first know? That there’s a world
to which we’ve been, not oblivious, exactly,
but so inside we couldn’t see it, who now see nothing else?
Heaven is over. Or hell.
Did you forget the rat?
It thumps and thrashes like a poltergeist inside
the chest of drawers but somehow, though my father is fast,
and though his rage is becoming real, every drawer he opens
is empty. What happens when we die,
every child of every father eventually asks.
What happens when we don’t
is the better question.  
To kill a wasp on water is the peak of speed.
My brother who is other has a mind of lead.
I with my stinging griefs watch from away.
How can it be there are no adults left?
What matters here is timing, not time.
His hand is high and white above the blue.
A wasp is also atom and urge, hover and touch.
Even wings are not a clean distinction.
Down comes the slap like a rifle shot.
What vengeance can there be on blank necessity?
My brother who is other has a way.
His hand is high and white. And then it’s not.   
Once when my father’s mother’s health was failing
and she found it more and more difficult to tend
to the tiny family plot at Champion, Texas,
which is less town than time at this point,
a blink of old buildings and older longings the rare driver
flashes past, I took it upon myself to salt the graves
as I must have read somewhere would work for unwanted growths.
As indeed it did.
In the months after, every Sunday when we spoke,
she thanked me for the blankness, the blackness,
(my words, of course)
this new ease I had allowed her mind.
Until one day leaning over with flowers the leached earth
opened and my eighty-year-old grandmother
tumbled right down among the bones
of the woman from whom she’d first emerged.
To see that image you have to be that sky.
It has to happen in you, that crushing calling viewless blue
that is so deeply in you that it is not you.
“O, Law’, honey, I like to died.”  
You don’t climb out of poverty so much as carry it with you.
Some shell themselves with wealth.
Some get and spend, get and spend, skimming existence like a Jesus lizard.
But for those whose souls have known true want
— whose souls perhaps are true want — 
money remains, in some sense, permanently inert,
like an erotic thought that flashes through a eunuch’s brain.
In 1980 my father bought his first airplane,
a scream-proof four-seater we crammed five inside,
which he considerately slammed into a sorghum field alone.
Unkillable, he killed the next ten years with work and wives,
then bought another, and brought it down in the solitary fire
that was his aspect and atmosphere. Homes, schemes,
thirty years of savings plowed into a sign company (!)
that did not, it turned out, exist.
A hole is hard to carry.  
People ask if I believe in God and the verb is tedious to me.
Not wrong, not offensive, not intrusive, not embarrassing.
Tedious.
Today I saw a hawk land on Elizabeth’s chimney.
It sat with its bone frown and banker’s breast
above the proud houses of Hamden.
Are you with me? Then see,
too, a lump of animate ash rising from the flue
(or so it seems) to be a pigeon
fluttering dumbly down
next to that implacable raptor,
suddening a world of strange relations
wherein there is no need for fear, or far,
or meat.  
There was a man made of airplane parts,
one of which was always missing.
He wandered the hospital grounds in search of a rudder,
an aileron, or some other fragment
that would let him fly from this place
where he was not meant to be.
There was a woman who emitted invective
ceaselessly, dispassionately, an obscenity machine.
One timid gentleman saved Saran wrap for five full years
and every night wrought an ever-more-solid ball
with which, it turned out, he planned to bash the skull
of the first soul he saw the dawn God blessed his weapon.
(A success story, alas.)
Another man with anvil hands sat six months of nights in faith
that there would come occasion of darkness, unguardedness, and vision
sufficient to rip from its socket one of my father’s bright blue eyes.
(Ditto.)
My father moved among them like a father.
He attended and pacified, he instructed and consoled.
Late to the trade, he worked too much,
and trusted his heart, no doubt, more than he should,
but was, by all accounts, at this one thing, and despite the end, good.  
For love read faith
into these lines that so obviously lack it.
For love let words turn to life
in the way life turns to world
under the observer’s eye, the swirl
of particles with their waves and entanglements,
their chance and havoc, resolving
into some one thing:
a raptor on a rooftop, say.
No power on earth can make it stay.
But is it lost or released into formlessness
when we look away?  
To be is to believe
that the man or woman
who inscribed with an idiosyncratic but demanding calligraphy Fuck da money — Trust no one
on the rough blanket of the residential motel
where my father spent the last two years of his rough residential life
intended the note of defiant, self-conscious (da!) humor
that left my father, whom I had not seen in years,
and I, whom years had seen grow sere, far even from myself,
erupting in laughter until we cried.  
Before my good friend’s good dog died
ten times a day she pressed her forehead to his
“to confirm the world and her place in it.”
Now she won’t even say his name.
Strange how the things that burn worst in one heart
one must keep silent to keep.  
Ten to one you thought of men.
The murderers, I mean.
But no. This is a true story.
There is another cell, you see,
in which a woman I have known since childhood,
and since childhood have known to be
suspended on a wire of time but nimble-witted nonetheless,
lies on the cold stone floor.
She is even more naked than they have made her.
She has killed no one not even herself.
Punishment, perhaps, or some contagion of fate, finds her here,
her hair shorn, both wrists wrapped, her eyes open,
pondering the parable of perfect silence.   Remember, he said, memory is a poor man’s prison.

Her story is a part of something larger, it is a part
of history. No, her story is an illumination 
of history, the matchstick lit in the black seam of time.
Or, no, her story is separate 
from the whole, as distinct as each person is distinct
from the stream of people that led 
to the one and leads past the one. Or, her story
is surrounded by history, the ambient spaciousness 
of which she is the momentary foreground.
Maybe history is a net through which 
just about everything passes, and the pieces of her
story are particles caught in the interstices. 
Or, her story is a contradiction, something ordinary
that has no part in history at all, if history is 
about what is included, what is made important.
History is the galleon in the middle 
of the Pacific Ocean, in the middle of the sixteenth
century, swaying like a drunk who will take 
six months to finally reach his house.
She is on another ship, centuries later, on a journey 
eastward that will take weeks across the same ocean.
The war is over, though her husband 
is still in his officer’s uniform, small but confident
among the tall white officers. Her hair 
is marcelled like a movie star’s waves,
though she has been too sick with the water’s motion 
to know that anyone sees her. Her daughter is two,
the blur of need at the center of each day’s 
incessant rocking. Here is a ship, an ocean.
Here is a figure, her story a few words in the blue void.

Research is mourning, my friend says. Which means what,
exactly, for the things listed in the archives 
as filling the galleons when they left Cebu and Manila — 
ivory objects, jade objects, copper objects, 
brass objects, lacquer objects, mother-of-pearl inlaid furniture,
pearls, rubies, sapphires, bolts of cotton cloth, 
silks and gauzes, crepes and velvets, taffetas
and damasks and brocades, stockings, cloaks, robes, 
kimonos, bed coverings, tapestries, linens, church
vestments, rugs, blue-and-white porcelain that numbered 1,500 
in one ship, wax, tallow candles, cordage,
sailcloth, musk, borax, camphor, cigars, varieties of tea, 
cinnamon that was dried and powdered, 40,000 pounds of it
listed in one ship’s manifest, cloves, pepper, 
nutmeg, tamarind, ginger, martaban jars from Burma,
dragon jars from China, Vietnamese jars, 
Siamese jars, Spanish jars, 800 jars found with the wreck
of one salvaged ship, jars that would have 
contained tar for caulking, oil, wine, bizcocho bread,
salted meats, dried fruits, lard, bacon, beans, chickpeas, lentils, 
flour, garlic, cheese, honey, rice, salt,
sugar, food for months, not enough food, not enough water, 
chickens, cows, pigs, up to one thousand souls
depending on whether the ship had a tonnage of 300 or 500 
or 1,000 or 2,000, ships that in the 250 years
of the trade route wrecked somewhere along the way 
more often than they arrived in Acapulco, sailors,
mercenaries, officers, noblemen and their entourages, priests 
and missionaries, slaves that were called indios
or chinos, nails, tools, iron cask hoops, fireworks, opals — elegy?

Poor devil, dog six years on a tether
clipped to a cubby box.
The sun dropped into a slot
on one side & after a dark spell
popped up on the other.
Birds of a weather chattered along

shrilled emergencies.

a dust demon spins itself up

                    Yael
                ","
Yael picks at their cuticles. When they speak to themself, they speak out loud. They speak to themself this morning. I think, they say, that I am coming down with wisteria. Their nail beds a bit purplish.

There’s a Caesar cipher decoder ring in their shredded wheat and, unsure of what to decode first, Yael hides it under their pillow. Yael says, Today I’ll be lonely. They need the practice.

Yael never drinks their cereal milk, pours it back into the jug. But they are thirsty. Outside of their tent, the lawn is still entirely a lawn — the neighbors kept to themselves last night, trampled none of the daffodils. A good omen. Today Yael can leave their tent without fear. Of what? The omen has no answer, it presents only the bright of things.

Yael shoves three empty bottles into their bag and heads toward the river.
 

•

The pigs are having a swim and pay Yael no mind as they submerge each bottle. Yael imagines the bubbles that shimmy out are the  bottle’s breath, that they have the power to take breath from anyone.

The hair on their arms turns golden. Then the water. Then the pigs flee. Yael looks down as Sun approaches. They were already kneeling.  Their shins disrupting the path of an ant colony’s leaf-carrying  ceremony. The ants do not bite Yael — Sun is watching, and the ants like being alive, love to feel the weight of a veiny leaf, love even more the sound their mandibles make piercing through that leaf.

Sun kicks a flowering fennel as He walks toward Yael, but forgets to change the wind’s direction. The seeds blow into Yael’s hair and up their nose. Though Yael did not see Him do it, Sun gives himself away by whining, It’s not my fault.
 

•

Sun’s whine reminds Yael of their husband, Heber. Heber whines like that when Yael wants to leave his tent. When Yael doesn’t invite him into their tent. When Yael doesn’t want to watch a movie that Heber has seen a dozen times.

It’s exhausting to be shown things, to try to enjoy a movie while also giving a convincing performance of that enjoyment. Heber ruins these screenings — he weeps before the scenes that call for weeping. He mouths each pivotal line.

So far, Yael has spent their life absorbing men’s favorites. On the rare occasion that Heber does ask to watch their favorite movie, Yael can’t remember having one. This makes Yael feel a creaking, hollow-boned kind of gloom.

This gloom opens the flaps in their brain that make them want to lie in bed all day.

Yael does not know the sound of their loudest yell. All their noises  have been practiced. Maybe this is why Sun’s whine makes their cheeks flush. The sound is a selfish one. Why should it go unpunished?
 

•

Sometimes, when they think of Heber away at war, Yael grows giddy,  presses their smile hard into their pillow until the whirling joy  subsides. But what is the mainspring of that giddiness? They try to dissect the thought:

          Heber = Giddy

                    Or

                              Heber away = Giddy

                                        Or

                                                  Heber away at war = Giddy
 
•

If Yael were to look up from the dirt, they’d see the kestrels circling above, their left talons leashed to Sun’s wrist by neon green fishing line. Taut line. No give.

Yael won’t look up.

Sun exhales and lets loose His belly. It peeks out from under His shirt. You can keep thinking of me as Sun. He’s relieved Yael is alone. I’ve been looking for a new name. His old name felt stale. Dead by comparison. Sun is perfect.

I have a very important job for you, Yael, descendant of — He’d left His notes at home — Yael. Enlist in my war against the wicked and blessed shall you be above all people in the tent.

Sun doesn’t mention that Yael isn’t His first, or even His second, choice.

— Tomas Tranströmer



One of those idle hours I did not want
To participate in “group,” when it seemed
Impossible I’d know a word to haunt
Again, or make me laugh, or spur that dream 
To roam myself the ranges of the tongue;
When on that ward I thought not one aspect
Of anything, no matter how strong, strange,
Or keen, could sharpen the “blunted affect” 
Even electric shock had no effect on    ...
During one such despondent interval
I read these lines from his New Directions
New collected poems, and the verbal 
Sequence somehow composed the correct code
To unlock feeling: corridor, right hand,

After  Jean-Michel Basquiat



Crows
               and more crows.
One crow
               with a rat
                              hanging
               from its beak,
sloppy
               and beautiful.
Another crow
               with its wings
                              plucked
               empty.
I wanted
               so much of today
                              to be peaceful
               but the empty crow
untethers
               something in me: a feral
                              yearning for love
               or a love that is so full
of  power,
               of  tenderness,
                              the words
               fall to their knees
begging for mercy
               like tulips
                              in wind.
I don’t wear the crown
               for the times power
                              has tainted
               my body,
but I can tell the difference
               between giving up
                              and giving in.
If  you can’t, ask the crow
               that watches me
                              through the window,
               laughing as I drink
my third bottle of wine.
Ask the sound
               the tree makes
                              when the crow has grown
               disgusted
with my whining.
After years of repression,
               I can come clean.
                              I was a boy
               with a hole
other boys
               stuffed themselves into.
I have wanted
               nothing to do with blackness
                              or laughter
               or my life.
But about love,
               who owns the right,
                              really? Who owns
               the crow
who loves fresh meat
               or the crow who loves
                              the vibration
               of its own throat?
Everything around me
               is black for its own good,
                              I suppose.
               The widow,
the picture of the boy
               crying on the wall,
                              the mirror
               with its taunting,
the crows
               that belong
                              to their scripture.
Can you imagine
               being so tied to blackness
                              that even your wings
               cannot help you escape?
About my life,
               every needle,
                              a small prayer.
               Every pill, a funeral
hymn.
I wanted the end
               several times
                              but thought,
               Who owns this body, really?
God?
               Dirt?
                              The silly insects
               that will feast
on my decay?
Is it the boy
               who entered first
                              or the boy
               who wanted everything
to last?

In the old place, there was no place
that did not see me.
Wherever I went mothers whispered
about me like a Greek chorus: I heard that boy    ...    I heard that.
I was just a boy. But it was
true, what they said, that I liked
other boys, that I had stolen Sarah’s,
though he was four years older
and they were very much in love.
I made him break up with her
in a Chili’s parking lot
while I waited inside. I was
fourteen. How embarrassing
to have been fourteen, to have eaten
at that Chili’s, often. That summer
I had no taste for anything
but him. Faintly of chlorine.
When he left for college
I had no one. Sarah’s friends
stared me down at school.
I found it was better,
if I could not be no one,
to be someone. Small, but
particular. Specified, which was
an apprenticeship for special.

baby, meaning untidy, confusing, monumental,
great in size, and also, of or serving

                                                   Danger, can you feel

For Hasna Henna and the Rohingya



Lice? My aunt once drew a comb through my hair steady;
she wouldn’t let what feeds on blood eat my inner tree. 
Where now is the word for such intimacy? I know it still,
but all I see are jungles burnt of our rarest trees. 
My point is: it takes a while to say, “I am a fire hazard,” or,
“a household of rare birds” is another way to say tree. 
I wrote one draft of this poem, then she died. Will I
forget her name, Hasna Henna? Let’s smell a tree; 
night-blooming jasmine, o-so-heavenly! A sapling
succeeds by flourishing from a tree’s seed. 
How else to perfume these needs we breathe? A sapling
of course = a small and soft tree (i.e. baby tree). 
I grieve the rice she fed me off a palm leaf.
Only now can I fully marvel: how finely formed is a tree! 
Someone I loved said to stop with the oceans in my poems — 
well, oceans + oceans + oceans! We drown so many trees. 
(Night blooming tree = baby tree = once and future tree.)
Lately, all I think about are trees. 
Read this again to replace tree with refugee.

yr jungle-scabbard    ...    Ya find yrself in the fret

into an anomalous nationality. A personal theory:
we all behave oddly around fat titties. Now here
Poetry comes to say she wants to be an ode to what is
muddy. OK, baby. Here’s to dank difficult borders,
gardens of ingrown perennials, fractured fins,
the wings of inner menageries. Here’s to our own
empires of dirt — no one’s pruned-perfumed colonies
of exotic beauty. This is not a poem! Or is it
an efficient exercise in surviving hysteria?

I.M. Ché Frye



i 
Kubla Ché, dreaming of ancient
Egypt, ate his hyacinths and was
marvelous. Wherever you are is
what I’m meant to say. Before you
beauty come, Dis crouching among
the black basalt, kneading master’s
soured linen, watching (bewatched)
the great beaten gold litter borne by,
deltoids sun-dewed stone, temples
bronze & strong &     in train     in
       thrall perpetual — 
                                I am of a mind,
daddy. Like, inside the blind-white
cloth-of-gold, the scented, sweating
box she sat in (think box, lock box) — 
Phoenician forest, seeder of  known
world’s every known green: malachite,
sea-green jasper, chrysocolla, olivine — 
& outside, too, other-handed, other-
landed, in rainless, treeless Thebes, my
dark knees tendered by two lands, rubbed
bare by work & love — 
       Move the tombs to the cliffs of
Beni Hasan. Send salt from the four
lakes. She is Nefertiti, she shares
the crown, she brings the single sun.
You do not watch the sun. But in
the Deeds of  Suppiluliuma she
says she is fearful     but there is no
fear past true heresy, her beauty is
clear of the next line & the next and
that kind of  beauty is     if not
redemption the possibility of a
separate resurrection.
      (Am I not beautiful too?)
      The miners are instructed: Find a
vein, gouge it to the very end.
 
ii 
Princeling Ché, wolfling Ché, fish-
eyed prodigy, anabole, brother
mine, all-beautiful boy, who’ll turn
your pages now? The lines unfurled
before you in your sleep, who sets
them to song? I cannot. (All men
have crowns and every crown can be
broken.)
       Were your senses mixed (blood
shaking your heart — orange, with
violet veins) or did hearing alone
stay and go last, were your nostrils,
at last, unblocked, your ears, at last,
symmetrized, did you unravel
first silence    did you dream?
       Maimonides says of Abraham
it is not God he disobeys but
Elohim; that in the bureaucracy
of divine instruction the envoy
fore the eyes supersedes the voice
in the ear     did they close your
eyes, daddy?     they must have
closed your eyes (enucleate the
globe, ligate the four recti, fix in
formalin) for under the sole edict
of sound
                     the son is killed.
 
iii 
Of  your father we dare & do
not speak.
 
iv 
Wherever you are, you are not
your death. You are not your cold
body, your subclavian blood, your
spine upon the body block that
proffers up your organs, your
humors pooled with gravity — you
are abed in natron, my friend, you are
forty days not in a metal slot but
roused into the mirror world, the
eastern fields of light, the father
sun rayed gentle on the rushes &
not the prosector but the jackal
keeps your stomach & the falcon
your intestines and your heart
remains your heart is yours for you
there are no more tests of   heart.
 
v 
My friend, magnificent, across your
empty desk they go on trading base
metals & precious gems. They found
flint in feldspar caves, below the first
cataract, where single stones, actioned
by wind, can mother a dune. They trade
tin south to children of  the stars, mix
alum with deep-red alizarin to
dye, to delight them who are yet to
learn the violence of  such charm
       heart hanging in its bloodslick
chamber     heart gleaming in its
rubied darkness
                   My husband, my god,
my gold-mad son
                                               lorn
issue, dim & darling eyes flooding
with natal sand, every night flooding
my free past. What’s a queen know
of this     my babies in their sunless
cease     what’s a queen’s knees know
but milk & crystalled honey     her
throat but subtle Mareotic wine     sun
smelted to gold, disced & sledding
behind her
       the whole world’s whole life
given her to give — 
 
vi 
Look, the dreamer comes!
                     Was this what you sleep-
conceived, this equal dialogue     this
black silt talk rife in death & germ
all-mixing, estuarizing, high-banked
along the flood’s go-down? (it
lowers down its voices, the flood     it
helps me to think, blessed ram, of
death as flood     for in it all
things high & low, fair & dun, flax
& inlaid faience, free & liened &
husbanded are leveled, meet, and
proven in the engorged     the
enchafèd delta.)
       I see it now. (The trick of death
is that it keeps returning.) Lady of
all women, they call me, they are
all my children now. (Labors of
my dim life.) I will prepare each
part for them. (From the front, no
back     from behind, no face     am
I purged at last of the various
envies?)
       I will build a city for you.
      (I will build a city for you.)
 
vii 
Twenty years ago we were nineteen
and already elegiac, we were
future tensed & annealed, we were
quenched in the dark peace of
violent histories — Karnak, Babylon,
Persepolis, Byzantium — the names
alone     (quarry our bones, convey
us to Karnak)     our names we
preserved, bent to stave & strophe,
accomplishing our envy, gathering
our violence, we were altogether
desire, (only ever) all we would
be     full of  imminence     (light
first, sun later)     stayed, asituate,
unforgiving.
 
viii 
Now you are time’s but I say to you,
Ché, in full mouth: We will be perfect.
There will be a recognition. The skill
has left your fingers, the dream your
brainpan but time, too, is prospected by
work     (the lumen of the vein)     (the
schist afire through the rock) and humans,
too, may burn like candles, their spines
wicks, their feverdreams the sputting
flames — 
       Work in the shadows. We will work
in the shadows, the rest being the
madness. Naughty naughty boy. Ward
residuum. Hold to murmur, hold
to method. You see? Time breaks along
its faults, lays bare its jeweled fragments
for those who love and work. It gives
it all for free. It asks only reversion
at the end. (And like, that end whereof
we could not think     thereof  (no
questions asked) you spake & said, My
father     and you answered, Here am I,
my son)     O tell me — go, you go
first (you went first) — what reason
makes this right, what insupposable
value, what excuse but ultimacy which
all know to be the breath of evil? 
       I will build a city for you.
 
ix 
About beauty they really got it, those
masters: great wonders call for great
suffering. The father straps down
his son, carves along the throat’s chalked
crease (signaling purpose), the slavers
slough off infants into sand holes
(streamlining, focusing the workforce),
the queen conceives eternal city, she
deracinates a people to upraise it
with their bowed backs, mortar it with
their warm, oxygenated blood     sunk
generations & contingency &
opportunity cost     gambling our
own lives’ great gamble: that wrong,
actioned by time, can be made
soluble in art.
                                            So,
Volchénochëk, you may be absolved — 
I tried & trying.
 
x 
Listen, I want to say something to you.
You arrived just in time. You told me
they’re not better than us, you honored
our sin, repaired my will, you were
havoc in the trees, the dense infolding
fire & its fuel at once (white fusion,
wild usufruct)     always your mind
was the Emergency, always severaled,
chording the upper & lower, equal
& bonded in appetency, bonded
always to mine.
       This is a moment of children.
Who cares who sees? (Who sees?) We
scoff at faultless entropy, we strip the
pith from the inner stalk, we count to
three. Talk me into it, daddy (the
first rolls were blank)     oxidize
this carbon black significance — heart
of water — this red hematite & blue
frit, these yellow ochres that every
child knows enflesh the unreal
sun — 
 
xi 
Put it another way: the ink gleams
for three more words before it (and
meaning) sets. In those three beats I
must be thousand-faced, entelechied,
liable, I must be totally told on — 
       in the middle of my life
a myth, a tidal mouth, I am planted
in bitter celery, in the phytolithic
matrix     all-possible clay     I sense
your slow impulsion all around me.
       Heart’s lake, calendula on my
fingers, laughter in the morning-
golded reeds (shaking the papyrus),
the scale in the wind that shakes
the reeds, deus absconditus, the only
gossip of the living, I miss you
so much.
 
xii 
Either we are eternal, with neither
end nor beginning, or we are
sprung from a single thing and
proliferative — in either case death
is not death (though time cannot but
give form to suffering). Believe
(if you must) as I must: 
       In all things moment.
       In each thing everything.

plants who forgot to stop growing;
they groan, shriek, quake, giggle, gurgle,

                ","
There was this bear cam
on the Internet. It was pointed at a place
called Katmai National Park, Alaska. A few years ago
my friend sent me a link to it.
I would watch it sometimes
but I never saw any bears.
Maybe it was bad luck
because my friend said she saw bears.
All I ever saw was the enormous river rushing
and the tall pines in the background doing nothing.
I mean, that was OK, of course.
I loved the sound of the river
and wind in trees and the sheer thrill
that such a sublime nothingness
could be witnessed like this. 
But I wanted to see a bear.
It seemed even more thrilling to be typing
in a cubicle and suddenly out of nowhere
there’s a bear on your screen
that maybe 50 other people in the world catch
a glimpse of. Maybe they are on a break from Facebook
or filling out a spreadsheet and BOOM, a bear. 
So I thought while I was writing this
that I would just check the bear cam online
and sure enough a fat bear is in the middle of the river
eating a salmon right there in the Katmai National Park.
I get up from my desk and tell my colleagues
“You guys, come here!” and my colleagues
come in my office but by the time they run in
the bear crosses the river, or pixelated
screen or whatever, salmon in his jaws
and the only thing there is the river
and trees and they say,
“Sandra, this is boring,” and walk
back to their own offices.

too paranoid to be lookout,
too shaky to use the slim jim,
didn’t even know how to drive stick —

I convinced Aliyah to let me
tattoo a cross on her ankle

the neighbors banging the portraits

calling me prodigy, fancy chink —

a good laugh, like when they found out
I wanted to be a poet & so they glued
roses & violets to the hood of my Kia,
& so maybe I wanted, for the first time,
to prove them wrong, prove
I didn’t belong there,
& so maybe I made new friends — 
friends who wrote poems,
who sat around talking about poems,
who went to school to study poems
and lived in off-campus apartments

I got too fucked up on white boy drugs
to drive back to the Eastside,
where, even without me, the rosin glow

three years sober, tucks the kids

where Andrew stands in the kitchen
reading the Bible in the dim light
from the microwave, where Nikki,
years later, coming home
after a double at Champps, calls
to wish me a happy birthday,
& I am, of course, too busy

zone, at a swanky party celebrating a man
I do not know, who just won an award

who’s been raving to me all night

Even though it’s May & the ice cream truck
parked outside my apartment is somehow certain,
I have a hard time believing winter is somehow,
all of a sudden, over — the worst one of my life,
the woman at the bank tells me. Though I’d like to be,
it’s impossible to be prepared for everything.
Even the mundane hum of my phone catches me
off guard today. Every voice that says my name
is a voice I don’t think I could possibly leave
(it’s unfair to not ask for the things you need)
even though I think about it often, even though
leaving is a train headed somewhere I’d probably hate.

I have to maneuver around a hearse that pulled too far

Perhaps it will all be worth it. Even though I knew
even then it was worth it, staying, I mean.
Even now, there is someone, somehow, waiting for me.

I should be in awe of the living, but the world dulls

the fragrant Cretaceous

flaring it into what might
have looked to the horrid

ovipositing (had the butterfly
begun before the period
broke off). Not much like

          The way to the toy store was blocked by a fallen tree
in the road. There was a policeman directing traffic down a
side street. I asked him, “What happened?” He said, “Lightning
in the night.” I took the turn and drove down the street
looking for a way to turn back. Other streets were blocked by
fallen trees, and I couldn’t find a way back to the toy store.
I kept driving and soon I was on the outskirts of town. I
got on a highway and drove, soon forgetting the toy store and
what I was supposed to get there. I drove on as if I was hypno-
tized, not noticing the signs for turnoffs. I must have driven
a couple of hours before I woke up, then I took the next exit
and had no idea where I was. I drove down a straight tree-lined
lane with farm houses on either side. There was a lake at the
end of the lane. I pulled over and parked. I got out and
started walking. There were several docks along the shore.
I walked out on one and watched the ducks swimming and diving.
There was something bobbing in the middle of the lake. I stared
at it for a long time before I realized it was a man’s head.
Then, a moment later, it was a coconut. No, it was an old tire
floating right side up. I gave up and started following the
ducks. They would suddenly fly up and circle the lake and
come down and splash land again. It was quite entertaining.
A man walked up behind me and said, “This government lake is
off-limits to the public. You’ll have to leave.” I said,
“I didn’t know it was a government lake. Why should it be
off-limits?” He said, “I’m sorry. You’ll have to leave.”
“I don’t even know where I am,” I said. “You’ll still have
to leave,” he said. “What about that man out there?” I said,
pointing to the tire. “He’s dead,” he said. “No, he’s not.
I just saw him move his arm,” I said. He removed his pistol from
his holster and fired a shot. “Now he’s dead,” he said.

          Mitzy fell asleep as soon as we got home, but I didn’t.
The evening had upset me. Why did Jack keep asking me if I’d
been married before? And why did my answer not satisfy him?
It was probably just a bad joke. Jack’s humor is off sometimes.
But he’s not a bad guy. Well, then I went to bed. When we woke up
in the morning Mitzy said, “Jack was right about you, wasn’t he?”
“What do you mean?” I said. “Jack said you were kicked out of
the Army,” she said. “I was never in the Army, how could I be
kicked out?” I said. “I don’t think he likes me.” “Oh, I think
Jack likes you a lot. He just wishes you were more interesting,”
she said. “And by making me secretly divorced and secretly kicked
out of the Army I’m instantly more interesting, is that it?” I
said. “According to Jack you are,” she said. “I think we had better
have breakfast,” I said. “Good idea,” she said. During breakfast
I said, “Don’t you think I’m interesting?” “Of course I do, honey,”
she said. “Let’s forget it. I mean, Jack is an old friend. Maybe
he was just drunk,” I said. “That’s probably it,” she said.
“What are you going to do today?” I asked. “I’m thinking of buying
a new dress for the wedding,” she said. “What wedding?” I said.
“You know, Carol and Bob’s wedding, next Saturday,” she said.
“Oh God, I forgot all about it,” I said. “How could you forget?
Bob’s your best friend,” she said. “I know, I just had my mind
on other things, but now I’ll focus on their wedding, I promise,”
I said. Shortly after that Mitzy left the house. I cleaned up
the breakfast dishes, then sat down on the couch. Why had Jack told
the two secrets I had told him years ago. I had sworn him to
silence, and now everybody knew. I had told him I would kill
him if he ever told anybody. I wasn’t going to kill him, but I
did think about disappearing, just vanishing altogether. Where
would I go? What would I do? And I do love Mitzy. I could tell
her the truth. I’ve had eighteen years to do that, and not a

          My wife and I were spending a quiet night at home. She was reading
a magazine on the couch and I was reading my novel in my chair. I said,
“Darling, can I fix you a cup of hot chocolate?” She said, “That would
be great.” So I got up and went into the kitchen and started to boil the
milk. A few minutes later I handed her the cup. “Hmmm, smells great.
Thank you, darling,” she said. I sat down and resumed my reading. She
said, “Did you know a tiger has the same number of bones in it as a monkey?”
“I don’t believe it,” I said. “And a whale has the same number as a mouse.”
“Get out of here,” I said. “These are some little known facts discovered
by a man named John D. Baxter,” she said. “He must be crazy,” I said.
Then we were quiet for a while. I looked over and she was asleep. I went
on reading my novel. Then I put my novel down and got up and started to
tiptoe around the house. I went into our bedroom and over to the dresser.
I opened up Mitzy’s jewelry box and let the jewels run through my fingers.
There were some fantastic pieces in there, diamonds, rubies, emeralds. I
thought about stealing some, but felt creepy about it. I put them back in
the box and tiptoed back into the living room. I tripped on the coffee table
and went crashing down. Mitzy woke with a start. “Go back to sleep,”
I said. “What was that?” she said. “I tripped, that’s all,” I said.
She started to get up. “Where are you going?” I said. “I want to look in
my jewelry box,” she said. “Why?” I said. “I dreamed somebody was trying
to steal something in there,” she said. She went into the bedroom and
looked in the box, then came out. “It’s okay,” she said. “Well, I’m glad,”
I said. She got back on the couch and picked up her magazine. “Did you
know jellyfish have bigger brains than humans?” she said. “I don’t believe
it,” I said. “Well, they do. It says right here,” she said.

          I told the doctor I wouldn’t be seeing him again. “No, I guess
you won’t,” he said. I walked out the door feeling really good. Of
course I knew I was going to die, but still the day looked bright to
me. I walked down to the water. Ducks were circling around and about.
A sailboat sailed by. I walked along the shore. The sun beat down
on me. I felt as though I might live forever. I sat down on a bench
and watched the joggers pass. A pretty blonde walked by and I said,
“Hello.” She looked at me and said hello. A man with a greyhound
on a leash walked by. I got up and started to walk. A woodpecker
was pounding on a tree. An airplane flew over, leaving a thick trail of
smoke. I left the lake and walked on up the road. I crossed at the
streetlights and crossed the bridge. A car swerved to miss me. I
thought, that could have been it, the end right there, but I walked on,
bravely dodging the cars. When I got to the residential district, I
felt relieved. There were large elms and maples overhanging the street,
and people pushing baby carriages. Dogs ran loose everywhere. A man
stopped me and asked if I knew where 347 Walnut Street was. I said
I didn’t. He said, “Oh well, it didn’t matter anyway.” I said, “Why?”
He said it was a funeral notice. I walked on, bumping into a fat lady
with a load of groceries. I said I was sorry. She kept going, dropping
a load of grapefruit. Then, further on, there was a giant explosion across
the street. Police and firemen were there right away. It appears it
was a gas main beneath the shop. No one was there, luckily, but the
firetrucks had their hands full. I left before it was out. The shop
was pretty much destroyed. When I got home I was tired. I made
myself a cup of tea and sat down on the couch. I thought about calling
my mother, but she was in heaven. I called her anyway. “Mom, how are
you doing?” I said. “I’m bored. Don’t come here. There’s nothing to
do,” she said. “Aren’t there angels?” I said. “Yes, but they’re boring,”
she said. “But I was going to come see you,” I said. “Go to hell, it’s
more exciting,” she said. I had fallen asleep with my teacup in my
hand. When I awoke I realized I had thought it was a phone. My
mother would never be so sarcastic about heaven.

It proves how far we’ve come,

The good peasants of antiquity
always ate locally, if at the cost
of variety, and under tyranny.

Neither they nor we get to choose
who would eat humbly, who like an emperor.

always only just departed, only just deported, did you don a suit and loiter on the highway your hands gripping a giant gilt-framed photograph of him and what questions did you interview at all who passed those vampires and angels you encountered, can you state for the record the moan you heard the ghosts emit across the nation-state,,, wuaahh buu,,, did you perform three miracles for a virile hag a witch with universes for eyes and did you request in barter a single boon his location or did you unlock his location using a skeleton, are we all a line assembled from white keys of death and is this song the sonata we hear when we press those keys, was your tool to search for him a wishbone, did you slice the wishbone from the breast of a monstrous old god, who was the god, what was his username, was it one of the ghost-giants you fled from terrified that he may have glimpsed even a shred of you, was it the famished god who grabs small ghosts to its mouth and slurps down their marrow, was it a devourer whose fingerprints leak out red tears in hysterical shame, was it Francisco Pizarro, was it King Leopold, did you see Joe Arpaio levitating each leg borne aloft by flying police cars, did you see Winston Churchill that infant-faced faminist turning loose new Emergencies, was it Andrew Jackson mounting a scorpion across that moist trail this pilgrimage for creating new

god with smallpox or pistols, hemlock or Maxim, London debt or land grants or fantasies or plague blankets or kryptonite, was it patricide, did you pry your fingers into his rib cage, did you hold the bone’s moist handles up into the sky and poke that plump cloud with your dowsing rod, did the stick sniff out your father from this city of ghosts until this wet rod twitched, until the witching stick tugged you through hell’s alleyways, until you arrived here at this modest house, what category of building is the house that contains your father, until you found a prison, until you found a shadowless space where he waited underneath a star, is death the story of until, is death the story you came to untell, did the light emit a silence like hssssssshs, this light the star wept—was it a message from the past strewn across black heaven, an emergency beacon from a plague universe calling help help from masters and money, what sound do you hear arrayed against you (here the ghost chorus leaps and screams keke keke!), did the star halt above that house like a police chopper spotlight, basking its blue heat on your skin, was this when the star’s strange beams obliterated your shadow, did you cry no please my shadow is all I have here, did you say without my shadow I am a ghost, without my shadow I have no history, how did you feel when the star cried and wailed down its weep-light in fragile pink lineaments, did you see the star throned above where your father may be waiting, is your father the king who sleeps in a cave beneath the city or does his life continue in this mute house, is he washing the dishes as we speak, is he talking on the phone in that loud way of his, is he watching a K-Drama while eating 牛 肉 麵, did he clip the soup’s recipe from that most authentic of sources Gourmet magazine, had you bought him the subscription for his birthday and was his reply to you months later, “Fine, these French can cook but take away butter and they don’t know how to do anything,” (hahahahaha say the ghosts) was that many years ago now in fact probably a decade, did you just glance down at your wristwatch to show how many days are left in your very own life, do the manic watch hands ratchet around like helicopter blades chuh chuh chuh, were you given this watch from your future self that renegade timelord, do you have the time, is time something one can possess

front door to the house and see the living room from your childhood, the white Naugahyde couch preserving the dark halo that he cast when he dozed off during his hair dye, the cubic light of a TV luminous solely from VHF, and framed by the window: a blue Honda, car of his youth!,,, these nostalgic recreations do they make you wonder if you had somehow time traveled to a coordinate outside of the underworld, traveled to the past, or would it be more accurate to say that we are already inside the underworld, that the apocalypse is not a spectacle but what elapses as we speak, what does it mean to speak,, ha ha blah blah blah,,,, did you tour the house of memory saying nothing, did you find the doors to each room shut, all handles locked, is this how your waking brain prohibits all fantasies, is it true that they have outlawed dreams, who is they, did you come to your bedroom door and open your wallet to take out your key, did you see on a dollar the face of an evil god, did Andrew Jackson wink at you from the currency and bare his fangs hsss sa sa,,,,,,, was this when the five dollar bill singed you, did the sign of the apocalyptic populist ignite and burn out the grooves from your fingerprints, how loud did you holler shocked, did your wallet keep falling into the floor and never stop, did the floor wobble like a trampoline, did a menacing voice laugh and say on god’s intercom here is your shadow catch, did you fall through the hole in the carpet, did you land in one of the old sewers and in the distance see someone sleeping on a stone slab, was it a body curled to the side uncovered by any blanket, did you talk on the phone with the woman from the ambulance, was it true that your sister and your stepmother saw his body covered only with a sheet, did the woman tell you what she had seen and do you remember telling her “You have a terrible job—you must tell everyone that the one they love has died,” did you recognize her when you entered this place and saw the Recording Angel, is the occupation of that archivist of prayers: writer, did the sleeping figure roll back as though on an airport conveyer, do the walls of the cave inch closer to strangle you, is the underworld a prison since those who enter it have no right to return, who will rescue you, who will rescue you now that you have lathered yourself with cave, is it true that you have forgotten how to breathe, did you aspire to be as breathless as the ghosts who populate this place or did you just have a bad day, would you like to stop, would you like to stop and catch your breath huh huhh huh, did you simultaneously call your expression narcissism and your restraint self-loathing, doubly self-damning, have you been given permission to forgive yourself, shall you ask the mirror Uncle what ails thee, what about your dowsing rod, will you wish for water, wish for air, witch for heir, did you tap your bone wand to the gray rocks repressing you, did the earth and its baroque caverns transpire into the simple night about you, did you look down through the wind from a ship sailing dark heights, did you find the ship’s steadiness strange given that nothing supported you above sky and city, well is the air nothing, was it the Maya who said that soul was simply breath, is the soul nothing, what if you crept into the airship’s spacious caverns and saw not helium but a palace of flowers, what if the entire vessel had been borne up by the exhalations of flowers their breath tasting sweet into the air, what if this was the world, what if you lived on a planet that had grown itself from the souls of flowers, did you once believe that grief was the philosopher’s stone whose touch silenced all spacetime into dark matter, on Sunday did you meet a man at the market who had returned to Haiti the day before the earthquake, did he tell you what that taught him, was the lesson to quit his job and love his daughter and begin afresh, did he remind you that you imagine the world for your child, is the poet what we name the vocation of love and freedom, on that first summer day in March did your child’s grandparents text you Christos Anesti, did you sit yourself down in the airship’s aisles unsuspended by clouds and float in the silver air, buoyed by nothing so magical as resurrection, did you take a deep breath and accept an in-flight complimentary beverage, did you gaze out the window at the spill of stars and think no not stars, the lights of the city, each one lit by a soul below?

We come to the city; we embrace the pantheon,

They want to be villagers again.

the sound of your history from its echo,
they want to be villagers again. 
You must not kill their sacred animal;

for they want to be villagers again. 
Sunlight and shadow is what made this rose, you say,
a god who could not have arisen elsewhere
but they want to be villagers again. 
The twist in your tongue is the river’s song.
It’s how your feet walk now, how your fingers strum,
but they want to be villagers again. 
The dusk of their coffee, their muddy water booze,
the herb of life shooting out of the impeccable concrete,
but they want to be villagers again. 
You point to salt escaping the sea’s hold—
a vision of a tundra reclaiming the desiccated grass,
but they want to be villagers again. 
You build terraces for the ancient woods to breathe,

He started out making feluccas;
an Egyptian taught him how.
Then he opened a shop by the beach, 
sold ice cream, parasols and chairs.
He asked for my hand when I was
in teacher college, first year. 
Time passes like the Ghibli here.
I was 7 months with my third baby
when someone sought him 
for a Zodiac. He traveled all the way
to Guangzhou, brought back a dozen,
has been selling them ever since. 
One night I asked how strong
they were, how many they carry.
“It’s all in the booklet,” he said, 
“no reason for what keeps happening
to them.” He sipped from a glass
of bokha and explained how 
from this same jetty, long before
the Arabs and Vandals, even before
the Romans and their famous theater, 
boats filled with people and goods
and sailed off. A day or a week later,
the sea sends back the drowned. 
His long-lashed eyes closed when
he spoke, his face unchanged by the years.
His fingers moved so carefully 
putting out his cigarette. He saw me
looking, nodded, then pulled me toward
his manhood to help him sleep.

ONE 
The First Invention, ear laid to earth, is listening
to the fingerlength underground beings moving in segments
through tiny tunnels; one inch shrugs out another,
as bamboo climbs in segments, joint by green joint ... 
Or an inexpressive mask that must travel
the world, uphill and down, always keeping its own
counsel, impelling  forward from inward—
unspelling a logic that cannot look out or see. 
Or a thought that recurs, till one wonders
whether Bach’s theme, without cause, or pause,
is like a cat in a night-closet, the cat evenly leaping
from level to level; the theme that sinks down 
into one hand, next leaps to the other, reprises itself,
then doubles down softly, a counterpane on a shelf. 
SIX 
Have you ever noticed, in Piranesi’s Carceri d’invenzione, the tiny repeating figures in the foreground?
Brittle, frugal, fugal, they ignore that above them
stairways rise out of sight, and somewhere else 
collapse, in-swallowed, devolving through walls or domes.
The same way Bach’s motive splays out to the right,
swoons flatly, swans it, footnotes, follows up,
talks to itself, purls, mutters, dawdles, resumes ... 
Six is playing at infancy, one three five,
that’s all Baby knows, a block pile clumsily building.
Then the tall chord falls sideways—pretends
it’s a melody—everyone knows it’s a chord— 
or a problem in long division which at one point just sticks
on that endless, that déjà vu decimal, six six six ... 
ELEVEN 
Eleven is caterpillars, two, marching: the one
stave of thick-barred sixteenth notes set down
precisely beneath the other, tiptoe to toetip,
close-clinging, rising and falling and mirrored: 
one looks down and locks the other’s horns,
or its own; the two could be said to be linked
like the locked yet endlessly out-spiraling
spindled ribbons of DNA. Yet there’s something 
scary, like Cicero’s dizzying concept
of motus animi, hurtling mind unstoppably inventing
figures on figures, yet with no vanishing point,
a world of ladders or stairwells 
where space keeps revolving, welling up into space
endless, unfree, unfolding like stairs in a case.

[For J.A.]



After the wind just stops you still hear
the wind’s wild almost, its approach and retreat, and how it kept
circling as-if-trying, as if about-to-be, an almost-speech,
loud and full of syntax casting about for 
life, form, limit, fate. To be bodied. To strut. To have
meaning. How easily we wear ourselves
as if it is nothing to have
origin, whirl, outcome, end      and still be. 
After the high winds stop you’re forced to hear
the freshness of what’s
there. It smacks, shimmers—this sound of
the scarcely there, the adamantly almost, all betweens, sub-­ 
siding till adjustment—and then the re-blanketing evenness sets in ... Gone
all that acceleration shooting up and back, futurist, wild with naming and naming
its one price. Oh nothing holds. Just the rattling of the going and
coming together of things, as if matter itself is trying 
to find something true to
say—crazed investigation, tentative prophecy trying on savage
shape, figure, progression—widening without be-
coming. Is this the last war now, finally—but no, only more of notion’s 
motions—more more the wind says, break grief, loosen possibility, let vague
hopes float, sink—let other debris slip into
their place. Rootless mind. Shallow whirling of  law and more and yet more law
brocading the emptiness. Then suddenly 
all stills. It is near noon. No more
spillage. No more gorgeous waste of effort. No more upgathering,
out-tossed reachings of green as if imagining some out there exists—hovering
inhalations, then as-if-hiding, then all coughed-out at once in a tumble— too much, 
too many, disconcerted, uncountable. Yet no dream ... 
After the wind stops you hear fact. You hear fact’s plan. It is huge.
The tree does not escape. Things are finished forces.
You hear a name-call from far off, tossed, dropped. Someone gives up.
Light rips here from there. Where birdcalls cease, you hear the under- 
neath. Try living again day’s long pitched syllable-ooze
hums after the high winds stop & your final footprint lifts off & no matter how clean you want it to be
nothing is ever going to be gone enough. Oh. Oak, show us up.
Indecipherable green sound us. Stilled leaf-chatter quiver up 
again, rustle the secret rule we’ll never catch in
time. To be late is to be alive. This Sunday. All things are
mention of themselves—as the dog barks, the air conditioner
scours its air—and each thing takes its place. But look, keenly, adamantly 
a road has appeared—a sense that something is happening striates
the open air—there is a limping in the light, a tiny withdrawal of light from
light, which makes a form in the gully—you haven’t changed much it
says—children still appearing out of nowhere now, so violently heavy with 
life, they dart, they breed, you be a ghost now the surrounding tunes up, 
as if it is all going to begin again, though this time without you
standing here noticing.... So notice is given. The look on the light
is that of an argument about to be made and won.
Yes you were underneath history for this while, 
you were able to write the history of being underneath,
you were able to disappear and make the rest appear.
But now it wants its furious place again, all floral and full of appearance,
full of its fourth wall, its silvery after-tomorrow, 
and ramping-up now quite a spectacular dusk.
This page is turning. It is full of mattering. Our unrealized project glows in
your mind. The animals lift their heads for an instant then back.
New shoots in the parched field. All the details are important you think but 
no, even the ruins look like they might be fake—important but fake—
though we must learn what they have to teach then push them back
deep into the light. This is the way it is it murmurs, circling,
out here in the middle of summer. Which summer was it which was 
the last of the summers. All the children are returned home. Day turns its windless
folio. You stay it says. We pass here now onto the next-on world. You stay.

Does realism get your vote? It gets mine.
The plants with their insatiable thirst for appearances,
the heart-stopping 7:00 p.m. air moonlighting as a pressed-cardboard Korean ashtray
(server, modest coaster) decorated with a single blondish branch
holding six leaves and a piece of rose-colored fruit (pear, plum, ripe peach)
slightly raised as if applied to the flat, creamy space behind
flecked with light gray, light green, and brown marks of varying size
from pinpricks to ashes, pencil (it looks like) to brush.
The romance of the windowpanes (I’m squinting a little) has nothing
to do with the misguided view, the one with the Fates schmoozing
under the maroon awning of the high-rise (schmoos is more like it)
and the embarrassed-looking sycamores revealing for all they’re worth
in their slightly fictionalized but emotionally accurate way, which  contributes to the overall tone
without detracting from the realistic participation,
a motorbike taking the corner too fast, a cat knowing the worst that can possibly happen and managing to avoid it,
which could be the key signature if not for a free-standing
radiance just outside, unmoored, a hint of plum or Anjou pear.

a comet against
my way of leaving, 
push it out of sky after
sky and after 
every loss on earth
the baby I was 
would come back. That’s
what it means to be lovable, 
to give oneself whole
again whole birth 
whole placenta whole
breast whole milk 
whole fist whole flower
but only what fits 
harmlessly whole
in the mouth. 
The baby comes and goes,
comes back to weed me 
of my body, feeds my
bald birdies 
what’s not for me to know.
I had hoped that all 
my animosity toward men
would lead toward 
safety in one who
would wake me before 
I hit the wooden world
and rock me there 
to say what violence
had not yet come.

Mortality is itself immortal Leo thought, reminded five
years later of the performance. Having come, despite his
Irish darkness, to resemble one of the Carrot clan
himself. Whatever he had read, and the feelings that went
along with those books, articles and poems, layered his
unconscious now like lava. What was the voice of that
moment, he questioned his uni-ball pen. The playing
fingers, the singer, the wind that came in and made King
Carrot pop his collar. As even the King’d say now, after 
Usher. Usher’ll die like everyone else but not for a few
decades yet, touch head. Where Leo wandered as if
streets were wild with flowers rather than construction
Mortality was in memory: mortality was immortality
even. Quotidian checking, marking, jogging things along
(e.g. the economy) these are the columns and emojis of
obituary. The privileged sublime? The working artist
reading the world under a misprinted title, taking
pills to still contradiction, lines of sky gray, and 
greenery (tracing the eyeline of buildings’ weed
mascara). The forcing of life through an earth crumbling
with fatigue and love gone wrong: or was that the
humans standing on it? Yes, we all needed some grace
to get from one side of town to the other. And how have
a career without going up some real stone steps? To see
things and write them up, whether on bench or phone
while stopping, or on a keyboard once home. To Leo
death was always shocking: whether blighted cornfield 
defunct toaster or road possum. Anything might’ve had
poison tipped into its ear: think of Carrot III slumping as
the piano lid closed, and knocking a candle over. The
singer leaping from her stool, suffocating the flames
before giving the gift of life, making every line she’d
sang that night seem crucial. That’s what Leo—and
probably everyone else who was there—remembered, if
only because a new song about superficial human life
(“A river is thicker than royal blood”) soon ruled the air

What injures the hive injures the bee, says Marcus Aurelius. I say
not wanting to hurt another, this late, should maybe more than
count, still, as a form of love. Be wild. Bewilder. Not that they
hadn’t, of course, known unkindnesses, and been themselves
unkind. When the willow’s leaves, back again, unfold all along
their branches, the branches routinely in turn brushing then lifting 
away from the pond’s face, it’s too late. Last night I doubted as I’ve
not doubted myself in years: knowing a thing seemed worthless
next to knowing the difference between many things, the fox from
the hounds, persuasion from the trust required to fall asleep beside
a stranger; who I am, and how I treated you, and how you feel. So
that it almost seemed they’d either forgotten or agreed without 
saying so to pretend they had. Did you know there’s an actual plant
called honesty, for its seedpods, how you can see straight through?
Though they’d been told the entire grove would die eventually, they
refused to believe it. The face in sleep, like a wish wasted. To the wings
at first a slight unsteadiness; then barely any. What if forgetting’s not
like that—instead, stampeding, panicked, just a ghost choir: of legends, 
and rumors, of the myths forged from memory—what’s true, and isn’t—
that we make of ourselves and, even worse, of others. Not the all-but-
muscular ache, the inner sweep of woundedness; no. Not tonight. Say
the part again about the bluer flower, black at the edges. I’ve always
loved that part. Skull of an ox, from which a smattering of stars
keeps rising. How they decided never to use surrender as a word again.

I made were the ones eventually I even meant to make, or

undramatically, to no apparent purpose, like pretty much
everyone. The sea dragged the shore; the shore suffered the sea.

                ","



From the sequence “Shekhinah Speaks”

Comfort, comfort my people ...
—Isaiah 40:1



A voice says, “Your punishment has ended.”
You never listen to that voice. You really suck
at being comforted. 
Another voice says, “Cry.”
That voice always gets your attention,
keeps you thinking 
about withered flowers and withering grass
and all the ways you’re like them.
Hard to argue with that. 
Death tramples you, an un-housebroken pet
trailing prints and broken stems,
pooping anxiety, PTSD, depression. 
It’s better to be animal than vegetable
but best of all is to be spirit
flying first or maybe business class 
with your emotional support animal, your body,
curled in your lap, soaring with you
above the sense of loss you’ve mistaken 
for the closest to God you can get.
You want to cry? Cry about that.
Who do you think created 
the animals to whom you turn for comfort,
dogs, miniature horses, monkeys, ferrets,
hungers you know how to feed, 
fears you know how to quiet?
I form them, fur them,
it’s my warmth radiating from their bodies, 
my love that answers
the love you lavish upon them.
Your deserts and desolations 
are highways I travel,
smoothing your broken places,
arranging stars and constellations 
to light your wilderness.
Sometimes I play the shepherd;
sometimes I play the lamb; 
sometimes I appear as death,
which makes it hard to remember
that I am the one who assembled your atoms, 
who crowned your dust with consciousness.
I take you everywhere,
which is why, wherever you go, I’m there, 
keeping you hydrated, stroking your hair,
laughing when you chase your tail,
gathering you to my invisible breasts 
more tenderly than any mother.
You’re right—you never asked for this. I’m the reason
your valleys are being lifted up, 
the source of your life laid bare.
Mine is the voice that decrees—
that begs—your anguish to end. 
When you suffer, I suffer.
Comfort me
by being comforted.

You have to make sure you have skin in the game was one of the rules they

thought. About what? It did not matter about what. It just needs to be, to be

keeps blossoming & spooling onward. Yes it’s a game it’s always just a game. The wind is
hissing this all afternoon. But even it, raspy and weakening, plunders this space that it
might find some emptiness. From mind. Lean in & you’ll hear plenitude. Listen it’s trying

To fold, to crease prepare serve-up. To imagine. To buy hold name sell. To shape. To

to offer, to bring, hide, make. To serve. Oh to serve.... My new humanity is now relieved of
