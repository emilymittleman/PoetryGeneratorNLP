They brought it. It was brought   from the field, the last sheaf, the last bundle    the latest and most final armful. Up up   over the head, hold it, hold it high it held    the gazer’s gaze, it held hope, did hold it.   Through the stubble of September, on shoulders    aloft, hardly anything, it weighed, like a sparrow,   it was said, something winged, hollow, though    pulsing, freed from the field   where it flailed in wind, where it waited, wanted    to be found and bound with cord. It had   limbs, it had legs. And hands. It had fingers.    Fingers and a face peering from the stalks,   shuttered in the grain, closed, though just a kernel    a shut corm. They brought him and autumn   rushed in, tossed its cape of starlings,    tattered the frost-spackled field.

Oh, Unreadable One, why   
have you done this to your dumb creature?   
Why have you chosen to punish the coyote    
rummaging for chicken bones in the dung heap,   
shucked the fur from his tail   
and fashioned it into a scabby cane?    
Why have you denuded his face,   
tufted it, so that when he turns he looks   
like a slow child unhinging his face in a smile?    
The coyote shambles, crow-hops, keeps his head low,   
and without fur, his now visible pizzle   
is a sad red protuberance,    
his hind legs the backward image   
of a bandy-legged grandfather, stripped.   
Why have you unhoused this wretch    
from his one aesthetic virtue,   
taken from him that which kept him   
from burning in the sun like a man?    
Why have you pushed him from his world into mine,   
stopped him there and turned his ear   
toward my warning shout?

It was there, the elemental center,   All the time. Eternally present, repeating itself   Like seasons, where the times and dates   For swallows and household fires are written down,    The grouse are counted, the quotas of stocked rainbows.   All that love of order, for its own sake.   Only the hill-farms, and the high sheep country   Above politics—the enormous relief    Up there, as the dialect names of skies   Return, along with their clouds, and the old knowledge   Opens the mind again. To dream, to just potter   In the yard, to fiddle with local stations    In the kitchen, where news that is no news   Finally, at last, fills up the years   With pure existence. Lit from beneath   The fields are evenings long, the tree by the house    Where Vladimir and Estragon kept vigil   With the stillness of commando and insurgent   Frightens no one. Slow through the air   A heron, shouldering aside the weight of the world,    Is making for its colonies, coevals   In a state plantation . . .                                     Nowhere but here   In the high right hand of Ireland, do the weather fronts   Give way so slowly, to such ambivalent light.

We have a friend in common, the retired sophomore.   His concern: that I shall get it like that,   in the right and righter of a green bush   chomping on future considerations. In the ghostly   dreams of others it appears I am all right,   and even going on tomorrow there is much   to be said on all these matters, “issues,” like   “No rest for the weary.” (And yet—why not?)   Feeling under orders is a way of showing up,   but stepping on Earth—she’s not going to.   Ten shades of pleasing himself brings us to tomorrow   evening and will be back for more. I disagree   with you completely but couldn’t be prouder   and fonder of you. So drink up. Feel good for two.    I do it in a lot of places. Subfusc El Dorado   is only one that I know something about.   Others are recently lost cities   where we used to live—they keep the names   we knew, sometimes. I do it in a lot of places.   Brash brats offer laughing advice,   as though anything I cared about could be difficult   or complicated now. That’s the rub. Gusts of up   to forty-five miles an hour will be dropping in later   on tonight. No reason not to. So point at the luck   we know about. Living is a meatloaf sandwich.   I had a good time up there.

Parc Georges-Brassens, Paris



Most afternoons, I’d run laps through Parc Brassens   where grows the second smallest vineyard    I have ever seen, and where those silver,   pruned-back stalks looked blunt,    strung-out on wires, and mostly dead   all winter. That was how I saw them.    That’s all I expected. Even in the cold,   I’d see a guy my age there, once a week,    playing his guitar. He’d sit next to the bench   where I’d be stretching. He rarely spoke—    just to ask if I’d like a song—   until the week before I left for good.    I was sitting at the top of a hill   about a hundred feet away from where    if you stand tiptoe you can see the Eiffel Tower.   He sat too close to me. We spoke of many things.    Then he suggested we go at it right there,   on the ground, under the sun. This is how    one lives who knows that she will die:   rolling in the arms of anyone when she can—    rolling in the arms of a musician—aware   that no one cares much what we do  in little knolls behind reedy forsythia,   in the middle of a Tuesday, in the middle    of living. And I would know now   how he felt, and the ground against me,    and whether he was rough or sweet.   And what is possible would widen every hour.    Oh, but me, I thought I was immortal.

Tulip, you   Bled on my green rug.    A jungle-red petal   Where my little kits    Rollick, fallen like a warning—    Yesterday I sat outside   In the returned sun    Trying to make more   Friends; after all these years    To think of yourself   Snapped, the sweet sap    Tremoring between   States of ice and melt.    An old love wrote to me   From his wife’s country place    To say he had been hunting there   And could appreciate the hounds;    In a white coat he is closely   Setting people’s bones, opening    Their backs with the hands   I knew    The cancellated paths   Of saying no or yes: I could have fallen  To a fearing of the little foxes lately   Come into the yard    (There is so little I know about what to do)   But I let them be.

Love not
being in the loop. 
Grant the spruces’ wish,
the golf compound
graying out of use,
suvs in the it lot,
power outage,
a chorus from the quad. 
Bless the elsewhere
where others are
not here or you. 
And rain
after midnight . . .      
Ask yourself,
is that rain or bells?

Who is that creature   and who does he want?   Me, I trust. I do not   attempt to call out his   name for fear he will   tread on me. What do   you believe, he asks.    That we all want to be   alone, I reply, except when   we do not; that the world   was open to my sorrow   and ate most of it; that   today is a gift and I am   ready to receive you.

The ribbed black of the umbrella   is an argument for the existence of God,    that little shelter   we carry with us    and may forget   beside a chair    in a committee meeting   we did not especially want to attend.    What a beautiful word, umbrella.   A shade to be opened.    Like a bat’s wing, scalloped.   It shivers.    A drum head   beaten by the silver sticks    of rain   and I do not have mine    and so the rain showers me.

I was the lonely one in whom   they swarmed in the millions.   I was their creature and I   was grateful. I could sleep   when I wanted.    I lived a divided   existence in sleepdreams   that lit up a silence as dreadful   as that of the moon. I have   an overly-precise recall of    those solitary years before   I opened the curtain and drew   upon a universe of want that made   me so strong I could crack   spines of books with one hand.

Not embittered   even while freezing   to the ice of their own lakes.    The night I was leaving for Madrid   into the noisy party a dazzling   friend-of-a-friend walked in: I want so much   (as a couple of kids on the dance floor want)   to slow the tempo, hold there longer,   to feel that seedly longing   to be pressed into the soil,   or that little lift the mothers get   when stocking larders, even now,   vestige of the primitive urge   to be provided for and to provide.              I went alone to see that balcony   in Verona, after the Roman dramas and luxuries   above the Spanish Steps, when an elegant   footman brought a pack of Reds on a silver   tray and all but smoked them for you;   after your towels had warmed in London’s best   hotel, whose name I can’t remember and am kind of glad,   glad now for the rest of empty August and   the convent hostel’s eleven o’clock curfew,   glad now when I go to the distinguished dinners   that I have stood alone   wondering at illuminated books,   looking at Woolf’s spectacles under glass   or standing under Bourgeois’s giant spider   at the Tate—at times the best kept universe   was my own, no interceding docents   or guided tours, but a riverine serendipitous   wandering—waif, naïf.                     I liked the light enormously so why   did I obey the bell that called me in?

It needn’t be tinder, this juncture of the year,   a cigarette second guessed from car to brush.    The woods’ parchment is given   to cracking asunder the first puff of wind.   Yesterday a big sycamore came across First   and Hawthorne and is there yet.    The papers say it has to happen,   if just as dribs and drabs on the asbestos siding.   But tonight is buckets of stars as hard and dry as dimes.    A month’s supper things stacks in the sink.   Tea brews from water stoppered in the bath   and any thirst carried forward is quenched thinking you,   piece by piece, an Xmas gift hidden   and found weeks after: the ribbon, the box.    I have reservoirs of want enough   to freeze many nights over.

The hummingbird hovers over bougainvillea, darting in and out   of blossoms as the bride throws    her corset among laughter and waving hands. Seeing you, glass in hand, sunlight   piercing the punch bowl’s crystal, I remember    the horse, an Appaloosa, the white and gray markings   like clouds, cumulus, one    later on his grave, the 2X4 cross with name   above a swell of land that could bring   a man to his knees,    or make him look up at fumbling shapes, cotton-fumed   and slow. I can hear the screeching    still. The colt had grabbed a turkey nesting in scrub oak, and prancing,   shook it in his mouth as we ran    reaching toward black feathers—then the ﬁne   spray of blood—until beyond adrenaline we began laughing,

Furthermore, Mr. Tuttle used to have to run in the streets.   Now, each time friendship happens, they’re fully booked.   Sporting with amaryllis in the shade is all fine and good,   but when your sparring partner gets there first   you wonder if it was all worth it. “Yes, why do it?”   I’m on hold. It will take quite a lot for this music   to grow on me. I meant no harm. I’ve helped him   from getting stuck before. Dumb thing. All my appetites are friendly.   Children too are free to go and come as they please.   I ask you only to choose between us, then shut down this election.   But don’t reveal too much of your hand at any given time.   Then up and pipes the major, leave the hand in,   or change the vows. The bold, enduring menace of courtship is upon us   like the plague, and none of us can say what trouble   will be precipitated once it has had its way with us.   Our home is marshland. After dinner was wraparound.   You got a tender little look at it.    Outside, it never did turn golden.

Poor muse, north wind, or any god   who blusters bleak across the lake   and sows the earth earth-deep with ice.   A hoar of fur stung across the vines:   here the leaves in full flush, here   abandoned to four and farther winds.   Bless us, any god who crabs the apples   and seeds the leaf and needle evergreen.   What whispered catastrophe, winter.   What a long night, beyond the lamplight,   the windows and the frost-ferned glass.   Bless the traveler and the hearth he travels to.   Bless our rough hands, wind-scabbed lips,   bless this our miscreant psalm.

Because anyone sitting still attracts desire,   Even this will not be given you, the park   In June, the silence of a bench at eleven o’clock    On a Monday morning, or four on a Thursday afternoon.   Someone will drift toward you, unattached   And lonely. The spell will be broken, the wrong word said.    It is cool, but there is no death in the few token leaves   That must have come down last night, in the rain that freshened,   The tree-smell that remains. For this season there is no name,    Not summer, and none of the months of the year—   A something inside you. Search your mind   For the green arboriferous Word the boys and girls swing out of    Like a tree, and the lovers   On the grass in tantric mode, in an ecstasy   Of untouching, and the human buddhas, legs infolded, reading.    Branches, sheer translucent leaves—   You would die to get under them forever, if it were given you,   The park, on this, a day like any other day,    And not the knowledge of everyone ever met   Who will come upon you, sooner or later,   If only you stay here. No, not people, or the walkways    Made in another century, or the murmur of the great city   Everywhere in the distance, but this breathing-space   Where the void no longer terrible    But to be relaxed in, the depressions   Which anyway here are mild, incoming from the west,   Slow-acting, chronic, lifelong not acute  Are there to be sat through, waited out   On a damp bench, as a man sweeps up around you   And the sun comes out in real time, stealing over the ground.

Would you believe it, I got lost again   And all roads led to Rakestreet. Which was which,   The short road or the long? A girl of ten   Behind her counter, drew me a thumbnail sketch    Of space in time. The Big House was, she said,   Five minutes away, or seven hundred years.   Nephin, nebulous in its hat of cloud,   A reference point. I would never get out of here    Unless I fell in love with my condition—   Rakestreet, with its boy behind the bar,   Its sweatshop, and its permanent television   In the background, rumbling from afar    Of war and worldly sex, greed and ambition,   While the dead slept under lichened stone   Behind Kilmurry chapel. Older than religion,   Older than history, this quiet need to atone    By staying local, once at the very least,   For an hour, a day, a lifetime. Marry the girl,   Buy up the stock, become one with the deceased—   Let Crossmolina and the Big House world    Be damned to its own eternity, Lough Conn   Forever signaled, never come upon,   Lose itself, like the reason I came   In the first place, and my aboriginal name.

I called up tech and got the voicemail code.   It’s taken me this long to find my feet.   Since last we spoke that evening it has snowed.    Fifty-four new messages. Most are old   and blinking into a future months complete.   I contacted tech to get my voicemail code    to hear your voice, not some bozo on the road   the week of Thanksgiving dubbing me his sweet   and breaking up and bleating how it snowed    the Nashville side of Chattanooga and slowed   the beltway to a standstill. The radio said sleet.   The kid in tech sent on my voicemail code.    I blew a night on lightening the system’s load,   woke to white enveloping the trees, the street   that’s blanked out by my leaving. It had snowed.    Lately others’ pasts will turn me cold.   I heard out every message, pressed delete.   I’d happily forget my voice, the mail, its code.   We spoke at last that evening. Then it snowed.

We were sitting there, and   I made a joke about how   it doesn’t dovetail: time,   one minute running out   faster than the one in front   it catches up to.   That way, I said,   there can be no waste.   Waste is virtually eliminated.    To come back for a few hours to   the present subject, a painting,   looking like it was seen,   half turning around, slightly apprehensive,   but it has to pay attention   to what’s up ahead: a vision.   Therefore poetry dissolves in   brilliant moisture and reads us   to us.   A faint notion. Too many words,   but precious.

A man with binoculars   fixed a shape in the field   and we stopped and saw    the albino buck browsing   in the oats—white dash   on a page of green,    flick of a blade   cutting paint to canvas.   It dipped its head    and green effaced the white,   bled onto the absence that   the buck was—animal erasure.    Head up again, its sugar legs   pricked the turf, pink   antler prongs brushed at flies.    Here in a field was the imagined world   made visible—a mythical beast   filling its rumen with clover    until all at once it startled,   flagged its bright tail—   auf Wiedersehen, surrender—    and leapt away—   a white tooth   in the closing mouth of the woods.

Twelve dollars sixty cents,  & the fact that there is no blood no storm  can’t wash into dirt, that the time for these words               is already ended,  that for all the rain that has been here before  so have I.            & there is less water in the world  than a famous woman once said, & I know that,            & that the stars in the river  also are real I also know, for they disappear also  & refuse also to be touched. & I have touched               bare things, & it works—  it can be the sole unbraided moment in a life—  but even so, what better days look like to me is still              the tiny gore  of heartbreak, & long walks with small shoes              that can’t be taken off,  & schools in a city I love that put molded cages              over their clocks,  because that works too to remind us  we are not ready. & the worst of all is anything that              stays as it is                        when touched.  At lunchtime a woman famous for her ability  to praise the ineffable                        says she can’t believe anyone returns  to where they came from.              But of course they do. In fact  some do nothing else. & what is it they leave behind?              Perhaps not the meaning of time,  but the time of meaning, & the fact that whatever  happens, tomorrow                        will change it.

As he spoke we could hear, ever more loudly, the noise   Of the burning fires; the flood of flames was coming   Nearer and nearer. “My father, let me take you   Upon my shoulders and carry you with me.   The burden will be easy. Whatever happens,   You and I will experience it together,   Peril or safety, whichever it will be.   Little Iülus will come along beside me.   My wife will follow behind us. And you, my servants,   Listen to what I say: just as you leave   The limits of the city there is a mound,   And the vestiges of a deserted temple of Ceres,   And a cypress tree that has been preserved alive   For many years by the piety of our fathers.   We will all meet there, though perhaps by different ways   And, Father, you must carry in your arms   The holy images of our household gods;   I, coming so late from the fighting and the carnage   Cannot presume to touch them until I have washed   Myself in running water.” Thus I spoke.    I take up the tawny pelt of a lion and   Cover my neck and my broad shoulders with it,   And bowing down, I accept the weight of my father;   Iülus puts his hand in mine and goes   Along beside me, trying to match my steps   As best he can, trying his best to keep up.   My wife follows behind us, a little way back.   So we all set out together, making our way   Among the shadows, and I, who only just   A little while ago had faced, undaunted,   Showers of arrows and swarms of enemy Greeks,   Am frightened by every slightest change in the air   And startled by every slightest sound I hear,   Fearful for whom I walk with and whom I carry. And just as I had almost come to the gates   And thought that I had almost gotten us free,   I thought I heard the sound of many feet,   And my father, peering intently into the shadows,   Cries out to me, “Get away, get away, my son,   My son, they are coming! I see their shining shields,   I see the glow of their weapons in the dark!”   I am alarmed, and I don’t know what happened   But some power hostile to me distracts my wits   And I am confused, and I lead us away by ways   That I don’t know, and off the familiar streets   That together we are following, and so,   O God! some fate has taken away my wife,   Creüsa, my wife, away from me. What happened?   Did she wander from the way that we were going?   Did she fall back, having to rest some place   Back there, and so we left her? I did not know.   I never saw her again, and as we went,   I never turned to look behind, and never   Thought of her until we reached the mound   And Ceres’ ancient place. When all of us,   At last, had gotten there, we all were there,   But she had vanished and she wasn’t there.   Gone from her people, gone from her child, and her husband.    What men or gods in my frenzy did I not   Cry out against? What worse sight had I seen?   I left Ascanius and Anchises and   The household gods in the care of my companions   And I found a secluded place deep in a valley   For them to hide, and I myself took up   My shining weapons and sought the city again,   Determined, no matter what, to look for my   Creüsa everywhere in Troy. I find   My way along the walls and to, and through,   The shadowed gate I’d left the city by;   Carefully, step by unseen step, in the dark,   Backwards the way I came I make my way;   Everywhere as I go fills me with terror;   The very silence around me fills me with terror.   I make my way to my home in case, in case,   She’s gone back there. The Greeks had invaded the house   And set it on fire, and through the house the fire   Rolled up on the surge of the wind to the very roof,   And the flames tower high above the burning house   And the heat of the burning pours up into the sky.   And so I go on, and once again I see   The palace of Priam, and the citadel,   And in the empty courtyard of Juno’s shrine   There’s Phoenix and dire Ulysses, guarding the treasures   Taken from everywhere from the shrines that the Greeks   Had set fire to; the golden bowls, the holy   Altar-tables, the stolen holy vestments;   Boys and trembling matrons stand around . . .   I wander in the streets, in my desperation   Calling out her name, Creüsa, Creüsa,   Calling Creüsa, over and over again.   And as I went among the ruined buildings   And through the streets of the ruined city, lo,   Suddenly there rose before my eyes   The strangely magnified image of my wife.   I was stupefied; my hair stood on end; my voice   Got caught in my throat. Then she spoke to me and said   Words that altered everything for me:   “Beloved husband, what use is it for you   To persist in this insanity of grief.   What has happened here has happened not without   The will of the gods. The high lord of Olympus   Does not permit Creüsa to go with you   To be with you on your journey where you are going. Long exile will be yours, ploughing across   Vast seas until you come to Hesperia,   Where Lydian Tiber gently flows between   Rich husbanded fields and where you will be happy,   A king, and wedded to a royal wife.   Give up your weeping now for your Creüsa;   I, a Dardan woman and the spouse   Of divine Venus’s son, will never see   The scornful households of the Myrmidons   Or the Dolopians, and never have to be   A scullion slave in service to some Greek matron.   The Mighty Mother keeps me on these shores.   Farewell and may your care protect and cherish   Your child and mine.” And having spoken thus,   The image of her receded into air,   Leaving me weeping, with so much still to say.   Three times I tried to embrace her and to hold her;   Three times the image, clasped in vain, escaped   As if it were a breeze or on the wings   Of a vanishing dream.                                  And so, the night being over,   I returned to my companions where they were.   When I got there I was amazed to see   How many others, women and men, had come,   Wretched survivors of the fall of the city,   To join us in the exile and the journey,   A heartbreaking company, come from everywhere,   Ready in their hearts and with their fortunes,   To follow me wherever I was going.   And now the morning star was rising over   The highest ridges of Ida, bringing in   The day that was beginning; the Danaans held   The city behind the gates that they had locked.   There was no hope of further help. And so   I acknowledged this, and taking up the burden   Of my father once again, I sought the hills.

One day the bees start wandering off, no one knows why.   First one doesn’t come back, and then another and another,   until those who are supposed to stay and guard the hive, those   who are making the royal jelly and feeding it to the queen,   those who form different parts of the great brain, must   put down what it is they are doing and go off in search—   having no choice, not if the hive is going to survive,   and where do they go, each one vanishing, never to be seen   again, off wandering in the wilderness, having forgotten   how, forgotten what it was they were after, what it was   that gave meaning, having known it at one time, now   a veil drawn. Is it that each one is a cell, a brain cell,   and now they’re failing one by one, plaque to Alzheimer’s,   or the way the cells in the esophagus will begin to mimic   the stomach if the acid is too intense, if you’re sleeping   and the valve won’t close, a lifetime of eating and drinking   the wrong things, those cells compensating, trying   their best, but opening the door to those other cells,   the wild ones, the ones that call those bees, out there,   somewhere, lost, having nowhere to return at night,   their search for nectar fruitful, their small saddlebags full,   but no one to go home to, no home, no memory of home,   it’s as if they’d stumbled into some alternate world,   one looking like ours but just a glass width different,   just a fraction of sunlight different, the patient waking up,   finding herself wandering, someone leading her back   to bed, but there is no bed. Confusion of the hive,   they call it, and the hive dies, each bee goes down,   each light goes out, one by one, blinking out all over town,   seen from a great height as the night ages, darkens,   as you’re parked in your car with your own true love,   until it’s just you two and the stars, until it’s just you.

Because with alarming accuracy   she’d been identifying patterns   I was unaware of—this tic, that   tendency, like the way I’ve mastered   the language of intimacy   in order to conceal how I felt—    I knew I was in danger   of being terribly understood.

London returns in damp, fragmented flurries  when I should be doing something else. A scrap  of song, a pink scarf, and I’m back to curries  and pub food, long, wet walks without a map,  bouts of bronchitis, a case of the flu,  my halfhearted studies, and brooding thoughts  and scanning faces in every bar for you.  Those months come down to moments or small plots,  like the bum on the Tube, enraged that no one spoke,  who raved and spat, the whole car thick with dread,  only to ask, won’t someone tell a joke?  and this mouse of a woman offered, What’s big and red  and sits in the corner?                                A naughty bus.

He was touched or he touched or   she did and was, or they were   and would. Or the room could, its   three doors, two windows or    the house on a slant touching,   touched by the drift down street, cars   pressing quick or slowing. All along   the town touched a river, the river    the filth falling through it. What was clean—   a source pure as rumor—a shore   touching lake touched by wind above,   and below, a spring. All touch blindly  further water. That blue touching   blacker regions in the sea so weirdly   solitary, each to under, to every   sideways past deeper, where nowhere.

I had a tapeworm, and imagined it   flat—paper-flat—like a strip of caps,   pallid red, a quarter-inch wide   with bulbous BB bullfrog eyes   peeking out of my asshole as I lolled   in a crowded fetid basement swimming pool   (the kind that used to be in inner-city Ys:   windowless; steamy; concrete-block moldings   chalky-cracked), and you whom I’ve neither   seen nor heard of for thirty years   were saying I’d give everyone in the pool   my tapeworm, which you knew had eaten   my insides and now had threaded through   both my intestines and was trying to get out.   Where were we? Everyone was old, old—   gray, infirm; flaccid and thin   or fat and bald, all ill flesh drooping—   the women in rubber-flowered bathing caps   and black one-piece suits as if we were all   on an outing from a nursing home.   I couldn’t see myself to see how old I was,   but you were thirty, at the peak of your beauty,   as when you knelt naked on the motel room bed   brushing out your thick dark waist-length hair   after cheating on the lover you were cheating   on your husband with, who was at that moment   waiting for you in another motel room   from which you had slipped to meet me secretly:   a secret inside a secret, buried, encased,   as if if we dug deep enough into it   we’d find what we were trying   to get or stop.

When we finally flip it over   the fireflies are out. The neighbor boy   has had his stitches in so I can finally admit   I think it is all fantastic: the suck   of the spark plug undone, the stuck blade   bent into the guard, and the sound   of the hammer’s head reshaping the metal.   In this our suburban Eden we’ve only   a teenage Adam too dreamy to manage   his motorized scythe and silly Eve leaving   her coffee cups and plastic plant pots   behind in the grass. Though it’s a long way   from a fall, this spring’s first disaster,   I did like the thin thread of red   on his upper lip, and I like my mower   turned over among the glowworms,   a monstrous dandelion as unnatural as we   are, out in a garden, with our untidy   golds and our dangerous sharps.

I tell her I love her like not killing   or ten minutes of sleep   beneath the low rooftop wall   on which my rifle rests.    I tell her in a letter that will stink,   when she opens it,   of bolt oil and burned powder   and the things it says.    I tell her how Pvt. Bartle says, offhand,   that war is just us   making little pieces of metal   pass through each other.

For a long time the Spanish from Spain   Who came here became slightly insane   In a special way and just a little.   You can try this yourself.   Walk farther than you can into the forest in New York   So it’s a toss-up whether or not you know the way back.   For you there’s going to be a smidge of confusion, a glow of fear   That smells like burning rye toast,   And the illusion that you are the only person alive   On the earth. You will probably have the second illusion   That no one likes you, which doesn’t jibe with the first illusion   Of no other people. This was about the extent of it, for the Spanish,   They felt all that just a few hours a week, but every week at home,   Living in, say, small San Francisco,   Which made thinking slow and hard at these times,   But if you try this yourself in the deep woods   You’ll see you can still think enough   And you’ll remember your way back to the loving arms   Of your wife, husband, or mother, in Rochester. (Yes,   You could try it as a child, but please don’t.)   The Spanish had a purpose to walk east inland to the Sierras, the gold.   The Indians said there were five hills and two mountains   Entirely of gold and you had to wear ferns dangling before your eyes   Like sunglasses when you got near the mountains.   The hills, they said, were not so bright.   The Spanish thought this was bullshit   But were having trouble with the coast (where   They truly believed the gold was) which was that boats   Could not travel north and south even as fast as people walking   Because the Pacific coast was opposing currents (you made   Half a mile an hour in the water with biggest sail).   An expedition of thirty Spaniards from Spain (living   In small San Francisco) walked east inland toward what’s now Mariposa.   It means butterfly. In that place, the shivering feathery Insects rose from the ground and blacked out the sun.   The sky had no room for more butterflies so the leftovers attached to the trees,   Making the trees appear like ragged trees.   Look up the other way, the explorers said to each other, but   That way, when they did, was no blue sky but darkness of orange insects   That did not fly in clouds but were the sky,   So any forward motion by the thirty men seemed, not seemed   Did make the sky covered each inch   With the thin trembling insects, brown or green or orange,   But as a whole a black ceiling with little light between them and the men,   Who thought slow and hard but did think, and so returned   To small San Francisco where no one believed them but understood   The illusion because when they asked the thirty men   What such an encounter with butterflies felt like, the men described   Feeling the way all the colonists and explorers and priests and women   Felt a few hours each week at home—   Fear making the olfactory illusion of burning rye toast hand   In hand with the illusion of being the only one   And the simultaneous but contradictory illusion   That no one likes you. How could everybody hate you   If there was no everybody? Or even anybody.   Well there was a way to fix this   And we use it now around here (I   Mean in New York and California and Nevada and Hawaii,   Not just in my house) which is to wrap our loving arms   Around each other. It works very well   And I know you’ve tried it.   The Spanish from Spain brought virtuous women   Over for that purpose only (you don’t think the virtuous babes looked   For gold, did you?) and it worked very well   Except the women were worse, I mean much worse, Not just specially a little insane and needed   The loving arms much more than the men.   They needed longer sessions and more sessions.   What’s more, if the expedition of thirty butterfly   Illusionists had gone six miles further,   They would have seen silver sticking out of the ground   Like glass after a four-car accident on a street in Rochester.   But for many decades the promise of the waiting loving arms,   Versus the unacceptable illusion of the butterflies   Forming the entire black sky, kept them near the coasts.   When you put down this book, you could decide   For yourself if it is true that wrapping loving arms around   Somebody is as temporarily powerful as I’ve made it   Out to be or is possibly permanently powerful or is an illusion   Like the massed feathery insects which were absolute.

A recipe for lamb tagine   demands a mysterious   ingredient: raz el hanout.   Animal, vegetable, compound    of kings like myrrh? I decide   not to look it up, to wait and   see. At first it is everything   we seek but can’t express.    Then it reverses: everything   thrust upon us—think fast!—   by the universe, like the leg   my friend Tom caught when    a cyclist got clipped by a car,   the driver stinking drunk   at 9:00 AM. Severed above   the knee, the leg flung itself    into the air, a javelin. Tom,   always quick, reached up and   caught it. But the story has   a twist. After the cyclist died    in an ambulance, the widow   inexplicably came on to Tom.   Not that Tom is unattractive.   Indeed he is the sort of man    I’d throw myself at if I were   a leg. It’s hard to imagine   the sex that Tom and this   woman would have had  there in the hotel room   with the blackout curtains   pulled. I’ve never had sex   with Tom myself, but if I had    been that leg or that woman   I might have whispered,   “What fine reflexes you   have, Sir!” “Sir, say something    tender!” “Cradle me against   the guttural gasp from your   solar plexus.” “Oh, Sir, I   sense the tip of bone    on skin, a surge of déjà vu.”   “I am coming, I am about   to come, your shuddering   lover, your raz el hanout.”

I sit here in a shelter behind the words   Of what I’m writing, looking out as if   Through a dim curtain of rain, that keeps me in here.    The words are like a scrim upon a page,   Obscuring what might be there beyond the scrim.   I can dimly see there’s something or someone there.    But I can’t tell if it’s God, or one of his angels,   Or the past, or future, or who it is I love,   My mother or father lost, or my lost sister,    Or my wife lost when I was too late to get there,   I only know that there’s something, or somebody, there.   Tell me your name. How was it that I knew you?

You give me the slip between garlic and lilies,   as if this is what comes of my unprotected   loves, of my hands in the sweet earth,   their willful miscegenation of the border bed   where you’re tucked in deep with tulips, too,   like just one more of their heart-freaks:   a fluke diamondine flake, a thin vein gone gold.   Being mine, you’ll grow up a girdled tree, girt   with a ringed-around root, nothing like   the fruitful vine of good wives—one of which   I’ll never be so, my not-love-knot, you may   as well come up instead like a kiss:   the one wind gives to rouse the Japanese maple,   October’s aerialist, its bright aureole   in the last late sun a red mouth, opening.

Wearing a tawny lion pelt upon   My spindly shoulders I carry both of them,   My father and my mother, into the darkness,   My father hoarsely singing, “They are there!”   —The glimmer of something that is glimmering there—   “I see the glow of weapons in the shadows!”   Through which with my purblind eyes I think I see   Something in the darkness waiting there.   Above me in the dark my mother’s voice   Calls down to me, “Who’s there? Who is it there?”   Step after step together we make our way,   In the darkness of my memory of our house.

Don’t get me wrong: I know   that knowledge is power,   that mystery’s water,   that hunger makes   a gargantuan   lover,   and yes, I’ve drunk   of the river Lethe,   from the breath of the Celts,   from the echo of   the bugling elk,    and yet,    alas,   here I be,   small and twee,   all liquored up   on song and love,   hard as rails   and light as air,   expecting the heavens   to throw down a flare,   to send in the clowns,   to burn a bush,   strike up the sea,   anything    that might mean   those cloudy bastards   have noticed me.

I used an arrow to kill the spider.   I used a steamroller to flatten the worm.    For the ants I called in an air strike.   Bee that found its way in through the screen:    blowtorch.   The mammals were easier—    a bucket of water for submerging the cat,   a poisoned word thrown to the dog.    For love, only a kitchen match. That   and a stove leaking gas    and waiting until the dinner   was good and burned.

The length of the wind runs from mid-May to murder.   The length of the wind runs from January through joy.   The wind runs as long as the right hand’s first finger   points to the sun after thunder.   The wind gallops prayerward   like a horse held in the palm of a rock,   no taller than a knee bent for the sake of singing.   The wind weighs more than the fossilized horse and stretches from fingernail to praise.   The length of the wind runs from mid-May to mercy, January through justice.   Unto the broken, dwelling in a broken, promised land, the wind drops a hammer   and some are warmed and some are chilled and some laugh and some die.   Silently through the nuclear physicist, the wind wicks   loud as paper-scraps trailing in the wind’s wake,   igniting an empiricist, fragrant through tallow.   The wind strikes the wind like rice in a paddy.   The wind scatters petals like blossoms of napalm.   The wind snaps the backs of malnourished conquistadors bowed down to gold.   It is the wind who estimates poverty in moments by the method of moments,   who assesses want in units of amass.   It is the wind who shakes America by the ovaries,   runs the length of revolution, all the calories in a dollar.   The length of the wind runts from mid-March to hunger.   The length of the wind grunts from Saturday through sorrow.   The wind flutters nothing but orgasms and afterplay.   The wind numbers seminarians more numinous than semen.   The wind is a mote on the wind.   The wind is the dust that measures time in footsteps.   The wind is the word in the throat of the dust.   The length of the wind runs from midwife to marvel. The wind ribbons out within mid-May and mourning and dust   is the voice the wind whickers glory, the wind whickers grief.

Fly from me does all I would have stay,   the blossoms did not stay, stayed not the frost   in the yellow grass. Every leash snapped,   every contract void, and flying in the crows   lingers but a moment in the graveyard oaks   yet inside me it never stops so I can’t tell   who is chasing, who chased, I can sleep   into afternoon and still wake soaring.   So out come the bats, down spiral swifts   into the chimneys, Hey, I’m real, say the dream-   figments then are gone like breath-prints   on a window, handwriting in snow. Whatever   I hold however flies apart, the children skip   into the park come out middle-aged   with children of their own. Your laugh   over the phone, will it ever answer me again?   Too much flying, photons perforating us,   voices hurtling into outer space, Whitman   out past Neptune, Dickinson retreating   yet getting brighter. Remember running   barefoot across hot sand into the sea’s   hovering, remember my hand as we darted   against the holiday Broadway throng,   catching your train just as it was leaving?   Hey, it’s real, your face like a comet,   horses coming from the field for morning   oats, insects hitting a screen, the message   nearly impossible to read, obscured by light   because carried by Mercury: I love you,   I’m coming. Sure, what fluttered is now gone,   maybe a smudge left, maybe a delicate under-   feather only then that too, yes, rained away.   And when the flying is flown and the heart’s   a useless sliver in a glacier and the gown   hangs still as meat in a locker and eyesight is dashed-down glass and the mouth rust-   stoppered, will some twinge still pass between us,   still some fledgling pledge?

I smell me   coming up behind me some days— sweet sarcophagal  history. The Ark after the beasts   disembarked, the motel bed  as the maid draws the shades, shakes the sheets, blinks back the stink, the leafed hollow  where the stalled mower   sits in its exhaust   and smells of wronged flesh, wing, meat    but me mostly, climbing the steps, extract of me, stinking of me.

—Katounakia, 2007



The cave itself is pleasantly austere,                      with little clutter—nothing save   a narrow slab, a threadbare woolen wrap,                         and in the chipped-out recess here   three sooty icons lit by oil lamp.                         Just beyond the dim cave's aperture, a blackened kettle rests among the coals,                       whereby, each afternoon, a grip   of wild greens is boiled to a tender mess.                       The eremite lies prostrate near two books—a gospel and the Syrian's                       collected prose—whose pages turn assisted by a breeze. Besides the thread                       of wood smoke rising from the coals, no other motion takes the eye. The old                         man's face is pressed into the earth, his body stretched as if to reach ahead.                       The pot boils dry. He feeds on what we do not see, and may be satisfied.

Words without much use now. Unable to remake the thing. And I thought  what should I think— followed by: spring light looks like feathers. (Birds  seemed conveniently decorous.) What then does this leave I asked  & was surprised to know so quickly—that my understanding of what the light & birds  could not be made to mean would not detract from them as they  were. Bound by feathers (a thought, I will admit, born of artifice alone)  they bore themselves aloft. What could I counter with? I, who held my heart  in offering as much for show as for a fear so deep I found I couldn't name it.

I have been one acquainted with the spatula, the slotted, scuffed, Teflon-coated spatula  that lifts a solitary hamburger from pan to plate, acquainted with the vibrator known as the Pocket Rocket  and the dildo that goes by Tex,   and I have gone out, a drunken bitch,  in order to ruin   what love I was given,    and also I have measured out   my life in little pills—Zoloft,  Restoril, Celexa,   Xanax.    I have. For I am a poet. And it is my job, my duty to know wherein lies the beauty  of this degraded body, or maybe    it's the degradation in the beautiful body,   the ugly me  groping back to my desk to piss on perfection, to lay my kiss  of mortal confusion   upon the mouth of infinite wisdom.  My kiss says razors and pain, my kiss says   America is charged with the madness    of God. Sundays, too, the soldiers get up early, and put on their fatigues in the blue-  black day. Black milk. Black gold. Texas tea. Into the valley of Halliburton rides the infantry—  Why does one month have to be the cruelest, can't they all be equally cruel? I have seen the best  gamers of your generation, joysticking their M1 tanks through the sewage-filled streets. Whose  world this is I think I know.

Tricky work sometimes not to smell yourself, ferment being constant—constant as carnival sweat (a non-stock phrase I palmed from a girl from Canada, a land where I once saw this graffiti: life is great).  And I have tasted myself, especially when I spilled sinigang all down my arm in a Pinoy workers' caff in Little Manila. I drank sinigang (is soup drunk?) in Big Manila too, with all its dead skyscrapers.  Seen myself? In looking glasses or, looking down, stocky as a shift working cop, maybe a Mexican cop full of beans (frijoles, I mean, not vim), paunch full of sopa de vigilia, pulling over a sozzled bus driver.  Heard myself speak fluently in my own language, have heard myself too described as hard work (as hard to get through as Scotch broth), though once someone rather bladdered told me I was magnetic.  And I may as well admit that I have touched myself (who hasn't?). In a forest, on a train, in New York and Paris with unparalleled handiwork, sinning   as I go, merry as an office boy spooning onion soup.

I hate how this unsummoned sigh-sound, sob-sound, not sound really, feeling, sigh-feeling, sob-feeling, keeps rising in me, rasping in me, not in its old disguise as nostalgia, sweet crazed call of the blackbird;  not as remembrance, grief for so many gone, nor either that other tangle of recall, regret   for unredeemed wrongs, errors, omissions, petrified roots too deep to ever excise;  a mingling rather, a melding, inextricable mesh   of delight in astonishing being, of being in being, with a fear of and fear for I can barely think what, not non-existence, of self, loved ones, love;  not even war, fuck war, sighing for war, sobbing for war, for no war, peace, surcease; more than all that, some ground-sound, ground-note,   sown in us now, that swells in us, all of us,    echo of love we had, have, for world, for our world, on which we seem finally mere swarm, mere deluge, mere matter self-altered to tumult, to noise, cacophonous blitz of destruction, despoilment,  din from which every emotion henceforth emerges, and into which falters, slides, sinks, and subsides: sigh-sound of lament, of remorse; sob-sound of rue,   of, still, always, ever sadder and sadder sad joy.


^^EOP^^

I look at the world
From awakening eyes in a black face—
And this is what I see:
This fenced-off narrow space   
Assigned to me. 
I look then at the silly walls
Through dark eyes in a dark face—
And this is what I know:
That all these walls oppression builds
Will have to go! 
I look at my own body   
With eyes no longer blind—
And I see that my own hands can make
The world that's in my mind.
Then let us hurry, comrades,
The road to find.

1           A psalm of Isaak, accompanied by Jew's harp.  O God Belovéd if obliquely so,                      dimly apprehended in the midst                      of this, the fraught obscuring fog                        of my insufficiently capacious ken,                        Ostensible Lover of our kind—while                      apparently aloof—allow                      that I might glimpse once more                      Your shadow in the land, avail                      for me, a second time, the sense                      of dire Presence in the pulsing                      hollow near the heart.   Once more, O Lord, from Your enormity incline                      your Face to shine upon Your servant, shy                      of immolation, if You will.                                        2           A psalm of Isaak, accompanied by baying hounds.  O Shaper of varicolored clay and cellulose, O Keeper                      of same, O Subtle Tweaker, Agent                      of energies both appalling and unobserved,                        do not allow Your servant's limbs to stiffen                      or to ossify unduly, do not compel Your servant                        to go brittle, neither cramping at the heart,                        nor narrowing his affective sympathies                      neither of the flesh nor of the alleged soul. Keep me sufficiently limber that I might continue                      to enjoy my morning run among the lilies                        and the rowdy waterfowl, that I might                      delight in this and every evening's intercourse                        with the woman you have set beside me. Make me to awaken daily with a willingness                      to roll out readily, accompanied                      by grateful smirk, a giddy joy,                        the idiot's undying expectation,                        despite the evidence.                                        3         A psalm of Isaak, whispered mid the Philistines, beneath the breath.  Master both invisible and notoriously                        slow to act, should You incline to fix                        Your generous attentions for the moment                      to the narrow scene of this our appointed                      tedium, should You—once our kindly                      secretary has duly noted which of us                      is feigning presence, and which excused, which unexcused,                      You may be entertained to hear how much we find to say                      about so little. Among these other mediocrities,                      Your mediocre servant gets a glimpse of how                      his slow and meager worship might appear                      from where You endlessly attend our dreariness. Holy One, forgive, forgo and, if You will, fend off                        from this my heart the sense that I am drowning here                        amid the motions, the discussions, the several                      questions endlessly recast, our paper ballots.                                        4           Isaak's penitential psalm, unaccompanied.  Again, and yes again, O Ceaseless Tolerator                      of our bleaking recurrences, O Forever Forgoing                        Foregone (sans conclusion), O Inexhaustible,                      I find my face against the floor, and yet again                      my plea escapes from unclean lips, and from a heart                      caked in and constricted by its own soiled residue. You are forever, and forever blessed, and I aspire                      one day to slip my knot and change things up,                      to manage at least one late season sinlessly,                      to bow before you yet one time without chagrin.

Love is the kindest expression of absence—  Or else is a day by the river,  in which by motion it becomes clear—  there have been in an hour an infinite train  of rivers, & which did you want to see? One  comes slowly to realize there is no evading things  (the heart will have its way, though its will go  unfulfilled), & there is no shame in this.  The pleasures in this world— soft breeze, soft thighs, a bit of music,  words that make a good sound— suggest when taken  whole that the thing the body longs for  is not & never has been some petite mort, a true thing  known to grass & the elderly man with a kind word  in greeting. And the woman saying that she is about  to come, as in going to arrive— at last to fill  the body held so long by stewards in her name.

If the sea is a cathedral, a tide pool is a chapel. Sculpins dart under the wind that blusters their cupped oceans. Sculpted by wave on rock, their pockets of salt grow thin from the rain, the suffocating fresh water. Sculpin and hermit crab and limpet endure the sea's absence, the lost comfort of constant temperature, while the unconceived sky drums the roof over their pooled world with litanies of unbreathable torrent.  Christ, I have no praise for you. Beyond saying a vodka-wrecked troller and shacks the color of the desire to die, beyond saying predatory snails that glide on their bellies like the penitent, flexing their borers, beyond saying seraphim that bicker exactly like gulls, the shells that are my ears sing no psalms except I can name many small creatures in the world of a tide pool. Christ, have mercy on all things that drown in air, I have no praise for you. I say the tide: Tide! Tide! Tide! I say: Ebb! Flood! Ebb! Flood! I always start with "Ebb!" I always end with "Flood!"       "Names" is from a sequence titled "Hard Weather Prayers."

Remember
The days of bondage—
And remembering—
Do not stand still.
Go to the highest hill
And look down upon the town
Where you are yet a slave.
Look down upon any town in Carolina
Or any town in Maine, for that matter,
Or Africa, your homeland—
And you will see what I mean for you to see—
             The white hand:
             The thieving hand.
             The white face:
             The lying face.
             The white power:
             The unscrupulous power
That makes of you
The hungry wretched thing you are today.

The angels I love bicker over cod guts and snapper spines. They joust for flounder skulls and pick the bones clean, screaming. Their harsh, fine voices break across my town in a language lost to my kind, thoughtless in the clear now of now without death. Christ, walk down streets paved with rain to me and you drown in my choir, my angels beating prayer under wing which is the want I have not loved well. Where did my weather go? Meet me where my hidden weather went, where praise and rain are never spent.        "Requiem" is from a sequence titled "Hard Weather Prayers."

With refreshments and some modesty and home-drawn maps, the ladies of the parish are marshaling the plans in hand, devising the occasions, in softest pencil: the Day of Hearsay, Leeway Week, the Maybe Pageant, a hustings on the word   nearby. Half-promised rain roosts in some clouds a mile out, gradual weather making gradual notes on the green, the well, the monument, the mayor's yard where dogs purr on elastic.  Everything taken by the smooth handle then, or about to be, hiatus sharp in humble fashion. A small boy spins one wheel of an upturned bike, the pond rises, full of skimmed stones on somehow days, not Spring, not Summer yet. Engagements are announced in the Chronicle, a nine-yard putt falls short. Dark cattle amble on the angles of Flat Field. The ladies close their plotting books and fill pink teacups, there or thereabouts.

The small white mutt of my Unsure Self trails the masterless Dog of the Dying World,                         watching him lope the endless block of yards he knew before his birth‚ . . . I imitate his muffled bark & snuffling breath, as round   & round                we trot as one through rustling browns of the dying world.                 For it's come to me now that a dog sniffing round for the perfect smell, & a place to pee             in the chilly breeze,   is the Rudiment of Life.  And, if so,             the Poetry of Fall is the dog of myself, untied at last, from the Rope of the World                dreaming he'll one day snuffle past   those crackling heaps               of burning leaves, becalmed by the scent of smoky light, Alone.

Eighteen-sixty eighteen sixty-four,   six hundred ten thousand men   gaseous gray, blackened body parts   like chopped wood in Virginia sunshine.   Or nineteen-fourteen nineteen-eighteen,   trench rats, thousands, big as badgers,   rip chines from horse and human flesh.   IED's, cluster bombs, punji sticks,   primed to shred feet, thighs, spine, sack,   yesterday, when we were countless. Conscience says Count them up and be good,   suck on me like red candy stick in casual lookaway moments.   Protected by neighbors, two girls   villagers know to be deficient   doll themselves up as bombs   for market day's chickens and yams, and like a world-body neural surge,   their protectors fly into fatty parts.

Chop, hack, slash; chop, hack, slash; cleaver, boning knife, ax— not even the clumsiest clod of a butcher could do this so crudely,   time, as do you, dismember me, render me, leave me slop in a pail, one part of my body a hundred years old, one not even there anymore,   another still riven with idiot vigor, voracious as the youth I was   for whom everything always was going too slowly, too slowly.  It was me then who chopped, slashed, through you, across you,   relished you, gorged on you, slugged your invisible liquor down raw. Now you're polluted; pulse, clock, calendar taint you, befoul you, you suck at me, pull at me, barbed wire knots of memory tear me,   my heart hangs, inert, a tag-end of tissue, firing, misfiring,   trying to heave itself back to its other way with you.  But was there ever really any other way with you? When I ran as though for my life, wasn't I fleeing from you, or for you? Wasn't I frightened you'd fray, leave me nothing but shreds? Aren't I still? When I snatch at one of your moments, and clutch it, a pebble, a planet, isn't it wearing away in my hand as though I,   not you, were the ocean of acid, the corrosive in I which dissolve?  Wait, though, wait: I should tell you too how happy I am, how I love it so much, all of it, chopping and slashing and all. Please know I love especially you, how every morning you turn over the languorous earth, for how would she know otherwise to do dawn, to do dusk, when all she hears from her speech-creatures is "Wait!"?   We whose anguished wish is that our last word not be "Wait."

1  It opens as a long lamplit evening with Rembrandt, stretched out with the glossy book of his Works on Paper. Brown-petal etchings and drawings: nut-brown, browner, irreclaimable rills  of iron-gall ink sucked and feathered into the paper's wan cusps and culverts. The ink...it's as if there's no pulling away from the wet, flowing line to the tiny hedge-village perched on the edge of the cliff  and the paper. Here the ink's overwatered and we barely, down in the forested loam, disengage the gentle saint, his rounded hat molding his crown like thatch on low rooftrees...St. Jerome.                                        2  Hunched, sunk in a deep-toned wash, he cares only for the huge, softleaved book propped on his knees. At nightfall Jerome swallowed up by his Bible misses the wistful look  of his lion withdrawn to the forested ridge, the drawing's diagonal. And from there, one can say that landscape exists: prowls and spinnies where a lion might wind a lioness, or his prey...  He looks out on tree-clouded peaks, tiny hamlets, two lambs in a wattle-fold. What the lion sees, we see. For Jerome, though, the lion is Judah, his seal and seed— Jesse's stem drops thickset leaves for him to read.                                        3  Saskia, of course, thrones in painting. Still, tiny sketches tumble from odd cabinets: the dear in a lopsided turban or twilled garden hat, sketched "on my wedding-day"—  Saskia. A cluster of lines, a rippled race of curls and cloudsets. And, for a rarity, in Rembrandt, flowers. The simple, surprised, smiling face of Saskia as Flora...After her fourth lying-in  (she was dying), he took to long walks on the city's outskirts; his sketchbook came home with mere touches of charcoal, a reed, a waterfowl, estuarial shallows unfolding to the rim.                                        4  Now life is meaner, chaotic. Rushes of arousal, lawsuits, debts...this print of a kitchen drab, eyes wandering, mouth a vacant, uptilted half-lune, her work-swollen hands on Saskia's velvet shawl,  The thighs parted, abdomen pear-pendulant, the pulled-off stocking-stays grooved in the flab to her copse of cross-hatchings—No one wants to see this. But his hand made  this stock, of himself the substance and seed. Fine- spun cosmos, brown tangle, soft sign: the old man spares us nothing. The book, the look, the lieu, the end of the Line.

You and your whole race.
Look down upon the town in which you live
And be ashamed.
Look down upon white folks   
And upon yourselves   
And be ashamed
That such supine poverty exists there,
That such stupid ignorance breeds children there
Behind such humble shelters of despair—
That you yourselves have not the sense to care
Nor the manhood to stand up and say
I dare you to come one step nearer, evil world,
With your hands of greed seeking to touch my throat, I dare you to come one step nearer me:
                        When you can say that
                        you will be free!

Kids once carried tin soldiers in their pockets as charms   against being afraid, but how trust soldiers these days   not to load up, aim, blast the pants off your legs?  I have a key-chain zebra I bought at the Thanksgiving fair. How do I know she won't kick, or bite at my crotch? Because she's been murdered, machine-gunned: she's dead.  Also, she's a she: even so crudely carved, you can tell   by the sway of her belly a foal's inside her. Even murdered mothers don't hurt people, do they?    And how know she's murdered? Isn't everything murdered? Some dictator's thugs, some rebels, some poachers; some drought, world-drought, world-rot, pollution, extinction.  Everything's murdered, but still, not good, a dead thing   in with your ID and change. I fling her away, but the death   of her clings, the death of her death, her murder, her slaughter.  The best part of Thanksgiving Day, though—the parade! Mickey Mouse, Snoopy, Kermit the Frog, enormous as clouds! And the marching bands, majorettes, anthems and drums!  When the great bass stomped its galloping boom out to the crowd, my heart swelled with valor and pride. I remembered when we saluted, when we took off our hat.

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading - treading - till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through - 
And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum -
Kept beating - beating - till I thought
My mind was going numb - 
And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space - began to toll, 
As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race,
Wrecked, solitary, here - 
And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down, and down -
And hit a World, at every plunge,
And Finished knowing - then -

Stunned heat of noon. In shade, tan, silken cows
hide in the thorned acacias. A butterfly staggers.
      
Stamping their hooves from thirst, small horses drowse
or whinny for water. On parched, ochre headlands, daggers 
of agave bristle in primordial defense,
like a cornered monster backed up against the sea. 
A mongoose charges dry grass and fades through a fence
faster than an afterthought. Dust rises easily. 
Haze of the Harmattan, Sahara dust, memory’s haze
from the dried well of Africa, the headland’s desert 
or riders in swirling burnooses, mixed with the greys
of hills veiled in Impressionist light. We inherit
   
two worlds of associations, or references, drought
that we heighten into Delacroix’s North Africa, 
veils, daggers, lances, herds the Harmattan brought
with a phantom inheritance, which the desperate seeker 
of a well-spring staggers in the heat in search of—
heroic ancestors; the other that the dry season brings 
is the gust of a European calendar, but it is the one love
that thirsts for confirmations in the circling rings 
of the ground dove’s cooing on stones, in the acacia’s
thorns and the agave’s daggers, that they are all ours, 
the white horsemen of the Sahara, India’s and Asia’s
plumed mongoose and crested palmtree, Benin and Pontoise. 
We are history’s afterthought, as the mongoose races
ahead of its time; in drought we discover our shadows, 
our origins that range from the most disparate places,
from the dugouts of Guinea to the Nile’s canted dhows.  
                                     II 
The incredible blue with its bird-inviting cloud,
in which there are crumbling towers, banners and domes, 
and the sliding Carthage of sunsets, the marble shroud
drawn over associations that are Greece’s and Rome’s 
and rarely of Africa. They continue at sixty-seven
to echo in the corridors of the head, perspectives 
of a corridor in the Vatican that led, not to heaven,
but to more paintings of heaven, ideas in lifted sieves 
drained by satiety because great art can exhaust us,
and even the steadiest faith can be clogged by excess, 
the self-assured Christs, the Madonnas’ inflexible postures
without the mess of motherhood. With this blue I bless 
emptiness where these hills are barren of tributes
and the repetitions of power, our sky’s naive 
ceiling without domes and spires, an earth whose roots
like the thorned acacia’s deepen my belief.

1God moves in a mysterious way,
   His wonders to perform;He plants his footsteps in the sea,
   And rides upon the storm.
2Deep in unfathomable mines
   Of never-failing skill,He treasures up his bright designs,
   And works his sov'reign will.
3Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take,
   The clouds ye so much dreadAre big with mercy, and shall break
   In blessings on your head.
4Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
   But trust him for his grace;Behind a frowning providence
   He hides a smiling face.
5His purposes will ripen fast,
   Unfolding ev'ry hour;The bud may have a bitter taste,
   But sweet will be the flow'r.
6Blind unbelief is sure to err,
   And scan his work in vain;God is his own interpreter,
   And he will make it plain.

Oil me, hand and foot, bind me tight and scented green: this is my dressing, done. Ay lived and spoke to what ay was. No matter if you answer. On hand and foot an oil and scent. Across my forehead fingers sweep a clay. Remember what ay was and am. Kind horse, lie down beside.

The Poet:           Fugitive lung, prodigal intestine—            where’s the pink crimp in my side            where they took you out?   The Octopus:           It must be a dull world, indeed,            where everything appears            to be a version or extrapolation            of you.             The birds are you.            The springtime is you.            Snails, hurricanes, saddles, elevators—            everything becomes            you.             I, with a shift            of my skin, divest my self            to become the rock            that shadows it.             Think of when            your reading eyes momentarily drift,            and in that instant             you see the maddening swarm of alien ciphers submerged within the text            gone before you can focus.            That’s me.                      Or your dozing revelation            on the subway that you are            slowly being            digested. Me again.             I am the fever dream            in which you see your loved ones            as executioners. I am also their axe.             Friend, while you’re exhausting            the end of a day            with your sad approximations,             I’m a mile deep            in the earth, vamping            my most flawless impression            of the abyss            to the wild applause of eels.

Sugar dries on paper plates. The cake’s   decimated and barely touched. What to do   with the balloons? A few float listlessly,   unattached, still bearing like bandages   the tape that bore them to the wall.   They’ve gone dull, rubber tips darkening   to a bottle’s pinch. It’s too late, or too early.   There are too many on the floor, stirred up   as I stir. In the end, I cut them, urge a blade   into the inch between knot and blossom.   Slow deflation. It reveals what they are:   sacs of plastic, stale with air. I’ve seen this   before, in the newspaper picture of Nefertiti,   bound in the antechamber of a tomb,   cast out of favor, her body, barely wrapped.   How they know her: by the queenly jaw,   age of limbs and teeth. Also, by the broken   mouth, smashed by priests so she cannot   eat, cannot breathe in the afterlife.

Into perplexity: as an itch chased round   an oxter or early man in the cave mouth   watching rain-drifts pour from beyond    his understanding. Whether to admire   the mere sensation, enough, or hold out   for sweeter ornament, vessels of wonder    born with that ur-charm of symmetry;   lovely ones we ache to prize and praise,   climb into and become because they try    our day-by-day significance: some of us   ugly and most of us plain, walked past   in the drowned streets: pearls of paste,    salted butter, secondary colors. They   drift unapproached, gazed never-selves,   blunt paragons of genetic industry. We    desire them but cannot want such order.   We stand, mouths open, and cannot help   stammering our secrets, nailed to water.

A yarn ball and a hill  maintain an equipoise until           their neatness starts to bore the gods                     of potential and energy           who hedge bets, reckoning the odds                     of when the rest will be   set in motion, and who,  first stumbling upon this clew,            constructed both the incline and                     the inclination to unwind.            Like most gods, though, they haven’t planned                     to stay; they mastermind   the scheme, ex nihilio,  then slip behind the shadow show            and designate an agent, chief                     remaker of their mischief made.            Each time, disguised, this leitmotif                     gets salvaged and replayed,   a universe begins,  for orogens and origins            suppose a Way Things Were before                     some volatile, untimely That—            sweetness perverted by the core                     or belfry by the bat,   or here, a hilly green,  whose still life, eerily serene,            completes their best contrivance yet:                     from high above, a williwaw,            a hiss, and then the silhouette                     of one terrific paw.

The suburbs? Well, for heaven’s sake   who wouldn’t choose the absolute   convenience? Cheap, a quick commute,   and close to Lowe’s, a Steak ’n Shake,   our own police and DMV,             a library, a lake.                        Esteemed domestic diplomats,   we trump conundrums (His and Hers)   and smother any fuss that stirs   the air of habit habitats.   It’s not an easy job; in short,             we wear a lot of hats.    And so, we’re grateful, from the street   you’d miss the issues we’re ignoring:   termites and week-old dishes mooring,   barnacled with shredded wheat,   the bunch of brown bananas stuck             with a yellow Post-it: Eat!  We dictate chores, but understand   the clock moves faster than we do   and focus on those old and blue   dilemmas of the second hand:   inheritance, ill-fitting pants,             smoke, rumors, foreclosed land.    Winters, we help keep track of taxes,   sort copies Xerox-hot in piles,   or prune unruly hanging files   (a fixture of our weekend praxis).   There’s always something. In this house,             only the cat relaxes—  because the clutter drives a need   for more, more room, more hours, food,   more use of the subjunctive mood . . .    tomorrow, yes, we must succeed   in keeping peace and making time             to garden, and to read.    Still, every spring our porches spawn   insects we can’t identify   and ferns turned freeze-dried octopi.   They spill into the arid lawn   with diasporic fliers, clover             and choirs of woebegone    house sparrows whose incessant cheeping   recalls the gloomy Ubi sunt,   our soundtrack to the nightly hunt   for whatever is downstairs, beeping.   (As if the sleepless wanted some             reminder they’re not sleeping.)    But don’t fret; clarity, if brief,   is possible. The best folks see   an artfulness in entropy—   the rust, the dust, the bas-relief   of Aquafresh-encrusted sinks.              So when, in disbelief,                        a lady skims new catalogs,   convinced her luster’s fading, faded,   and, afraid to end up jaded,   doughy in orthotic clogs,   she gracefully accepts her fate             and rises early.

Here I am saying “The leaves are falling”   —one of those choruses   that vie with interminable verses   to mock hoarders.   Yeah, we get   that a palette of winds   is a pretty thing:   one blurs the anther, another   the river splurging on riprap,   expunging   phosphates,   out of the temperature   differential building   sculptural fogs   that promenade   between shores a glacier   wedged ajar, a fjord.   Whatever gives the river   its seriousness reverses   in the light   of those clouds moving   as if absorbing   their pomp in advance of it—   characters   which untied the painter   and took the sculls again.

Surely there are teeth so small.   I have listened for their turning,   this frail swell and fall    like old blood yearning   upwards through the skin of days.   Slowly, I am learning    their count, though numbers fray   in me, and the loaded instants   graft, coming always    to the same tangle: the distant   cry merging with the song   at hand, the rain’s insistent    opening in daylong   dryness, the plain moon   draining into dawn.    And below it all, hewn   from the pliant light of some   Geneva noon,    they spin time’s thrum.   Stopped, I have bent my ears   to them. I have become    sound inside their years.   Surely I have known the whole   of grief and grace in gears.

Another dead mare waits   in the shoals of some body   of water, waits to be burden,   borne into a foaming ocean,   where it might become food   for whales, or, simply empty   signifier—hair latched to the sea’s undulation   like Absalom’s beauty   caught in the playful branches   of a tree desiring union,   entanglement, thick confusion—   but not this mare;   she does not get the luxury   of a lyric—a song that makes our own undoing   or killing sweet even as we go down   into the fire to rise as smoke.   This horse must lie, eyes open,   amongst the stones and fresh water   crawfish in Money, Mississippi,   listen to the men’s boots break the water   as they drop a black boy’s body near her head,   pick him up, only to let him fall again   there: bent and eye-to-eye with her   as though decaying is something   that requires a witness   —as though the mare might say:   on Tuesday after the rain fell,   the boy’s neck finally snapped   from the weight of the mill fan;   he never looked at me again.

The night’s turned everything to junipers  shagged & spooked with cerulean chalk-fruit,  weird berries whiffing of Martians in rut.  I forget this isn’t my universe  sometimes. Sometimes I think I was falling  most of my life to land here, a lone skirl  in the immaculate hush. In my world  I waltzed with my ink-self, my black shantung.   Owls swallow vowels in stilled trees. It’s not  sleeplessness, it’s fear of what the dark will  do if I don’t keep a close eye on it.  Blue minutes leak from the pricked stars’ prisms,  seep into the earth unchecked. Just as well—  I’ve hardly enough arms to gather them.

Long before you see train  The tracks sing and tremble,  Long before you know direction  Train come from, a hum  Announces it soon arrive.  So we tend to drop on all fours  Even before we look left or right.  We skip the sleepers or walk  Along by balancing on a rail.  We talk about the capital  Where the train ends its run  From the interior stacked with  The outsized trunks of felled  Trees and open-topped cars of bauxite.  We always hide from it unsure  What the train will do if we  Stand next to the tracks.  It flattens our nails into knives,  It obliterates any traffic  Caught by it at crossroads,  It whistles a battle cry,  Steam from the engine a mood  Not to mess with or else.  Rails without beginning or end,  Twinned hopes always at your back,  Always up front signaling you on,  Double oxen, hoof stomp, temper  Tantrum, stampede, clatter  Matter, head splitter, hear us,  Stooped with an ear to the line—    greenheart, mora, baromalli,  purple heart, crabwood,  kabakalli, womara.

The shoemaker’s wife ran preschool  With a fist made not so much of iron  But wire bristles on a wooden brush.   She made us recite and learn by rote.  Our trick was to mouth words, sound  As if we knew what we would one day   Come to know, what would dawn  On us as sure as a centipede knows  What to do with its myriad legs.   She made us settle our feet on the mud  Floor of her daub and wattle hut and she  Wielded a cane cut from wood that bit   Into the palm of the hand and left a burn  That resonated up the arm for an age  After its smart swing and crisp contact.   Worst of all was the shoe cupboard  Where the old man stored his wire  Brushes: a cold, dark, narrow place,   Replete with brushes hung on nails  Covering every square inch and said  To come alive when a child was locked   In with them so that they scrubbed  Flesh off that child’s bones. She said  We would end up there if we did not   Concentrate, so we stilled our feet  And spoke the words in the right order  For colors in a rainbow until the very  Thing took her place in front of us  Arranged in cuneiform, polished,  Brandishing a window to climb out.

All winter we sat blind, I next to the girl   who loved her scabs, the blood shields   her head gave up, her face a sun of blank   amazement. She drew. This means love:   a circle with a line through it. More work:   a cross. More crosses. Ice sloughed   through fields. Ice river, the pages   of our notebooks. Outside: limbs and roads   and wires. Outside cracked with force   and turning. Our poems filled with salt.   He took me to his bed.   The writer never speaks. The writer speaks   in details, the sateen lining of my coat,   the star point of tongue kissing. The winter   speaks in the whip. Runoff nixed   with ash. I spilt water on my notebook.   Words went back to ink; paper back   to ruffle, pulp. You smell like dog, the girl   said. You will be left like the winter.   Little sputter in the car’s craw. Little   crevice in the pavement. Ice reminder.   He took me to his bed, saying: Ali,   Ali, tell no one.

In someone’s distant algorithm   your mortgage was bundled to another’s   —hedged—   and stamped a new “security.”   While it was swapped   from investor to investor   accruing fees and interest at each turn,   your shadow   partner   defaulted   and she abandoned her home.    Someone uses your mortgage   to leverage   something   far inside the starbursts of a server.   Likewise marriage   has   no image—   What’s a mortgage   and who’s   it engage   on the other side of the firewall?    *    I witnessed a will   which—the language invested with law   godmothers the peacock’s   fanned   screech—   would take care of the baby in the event of a   [blesses herself]  It lives at the Cathedral   and seems to be some kind of   mascot for   Baptisms    *    Securities:    The future art you’ll make and its pleasure   is hedged against the   boys who died    you fancied.

She had a death in me, knees drawn up   and my bowl and cloth rinsed through with her.   As morning takes night, field closes the hare,   and ay would burrow into her.

Panic attacks your pain-porous skin?  Imagine the layers of onion, Sufi-circling  and circling until there is no tear-making body.  If the issue is anorexia, taking starvation’s  dark spirit-flight, or anhedonia, running from  the skin’s having fun, consider the mushroom’s  fleshy erection, and the pumpkins, earth goddesses  and rotund Buddhas sprawled by compost’s funky aerosol.  For social phobia, desensitize among the rows  of corn’s parade, ticker tape leaves and Rasta tassels  that wind-strut and bring on the crows’ hop and rap.  Too much affect: meditate on potatoes, taciturn  as overturned stones. Too little: visualize the hanging  tomatoes’ insides, the soft hearts, sentimental ornaments.  From the lettuce there is common sense for narcissism:  acceptance as side dish, garnish for a meaty sandwich.  If that leaf isn’t the dose, there’s always the soil  people shovel and level, rake and make wishful with seed,  feed leftovers from the compost’s vegan sewer,  the soil that wants for nothing and yields and yields.

to beat the froggiest   of morning voices,      my son gets out of bed   and takes a lumpish song      along—a little lyric   learned in kindergarten,      something about a   boat. He’s found it in      the bog of his throat   before his feet have hit      the ground, follows   its wonky melody down      the hall and into the loo   as if it were the most      natural thing for a little   boy to do, and lets it      loose awhile in there   to a tinkling sound while      I lie still in bed, alive   like I’ve never been, in       love again with life,   afraid they’ll find me      drowned here, drowned    in more than my fair      share of joy.

Two flags nuzzle each other in the desultory gust   because they are   fleeing the trees, who are cruel to one another,         shading their neighbors to death    a mixed bag   advocating small business in a loose confederation.

Bewilderment and thrill are whip-quick   twins, carried on your backs, each vow   new to touch and each mistake a broken    biscuit. I was you. Sea robber boarding   the won galleon. Roaring trees. Machines   without levers, easy in bowel and lung.    One cartwheel over the quicksand curve   of Tuesday to Tuesday and you’re gone,   summering, a ship on the farthest wave.

(Lines on the loss of the "Titanic")



I
            In a solitude of the sea
            Deep from human vanity,
And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she. 
II
            Steel chambers, late the pyres
            Of her salamandrine fires,
Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres. 
III
            Over the mirrors meant
            To glass the opulent
The sea-worm crawls — grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent. 
IV
            Jewels in joy designed
            To ravish the sensuous mind
Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind. 
V
            Dim moon-eyed fishes near
            Gaze at the gilded gear
And query: "What does this vaingloriousness down here?" ... 
VI
            Well: while was fashioning
            This creature of cleaving wing,
The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything 
VII
            Prepared a sinister mate
            For her — so gaily great —
A Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate. 
VIII
            And as the smart ship grew
            In stature, grace, and hue,
In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too. 
IX
            Alien they seemed to be;
            No mortal eye could see
The intimate welding of their later history, 
X
            Or sign that they were bent
            By paths coincident
On being anon twin halves of one august event, 
XI
            Till the Spinner of the Years
            Said "Now!" And each one hears,
And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.

Is the ocean really inside seashells

Behold and soak like a sponge.   
I have discovered that the island of Puerto Rico   
is the ears of Saru-Saru, a poet reputed to have lived   
in Atlantis. On the day that the water kissed and   
embraced and filled all the holes of that giant   
missing link, this bard’s curiosity was the greatest   
for he kept swimming and listening for causes.   
He picked up rocks before they sank and blew   
wind viciously into them. Finally he blew so hard   
into a rock that he busted his ear drums; angry,   
he recited poems as he tried turning into a bird   
to fly to green Brazil. His left ear opened up   
like a canal and a rock lodged in it. Rock attracts   
rock and many rocks attached to this rock. It got   
like a rocket. His ear stayed with it in a horizontal   
position. Finally after so many generations he got   
to hear what he most wanted: the sounds made by flowers   
as they stretched into the light. Behold, I have   
discovered that the island of Puerto Rico is the   
ears of Saru-Saru.

When summer ended
the leaves of snapdragons withered
taking their shrill-colored mouths with them.
They were still, so quiet. They were
violet where umber now is. She hated
and she hated to see
them go. Flowers 
born when the weather was good - this
she thinks of, watching the branch of peaches
daring their ways above the fence, and further,
two hummingbirds, hovering, stuck to each other,
arcing their bodies in grim determination
to find what is good, what is
given them to find. These are warriors 
distancing themselves from history.
They find peace
in the way they contain the wind
and are gone.

I find a strange knowledge of wind,
an open door in the mountain
pass where everything intersects.
Believe me. This will not pass.
This is a world where flags
contain themselves, and are still,
marked by their unfurled edges.
Lean stuff sways on the boughs
of pitch pine: silver, almost tinsel,
all light gone blue and sprouting
orange oils in a last bouquet. 
       2
These were the nest builders;
I caught one last morning, I sang
so it fell down, stupid,
from the trees. They’re so incorrect
in their dead skin. Witness their twig
feet, the mistake of their hands.
They will follow you. They yearn
pebbles for their gullets to grind
their own seed. They swallow
so selflessly and die
like patriots. 
       3
Last Christmas, a family of five
woke from their dreaming and
dreamed themselves over: the baby
in its pink pajamas, the boy
in the red flannel bathrobe
he grabbed from the door,
a mother, a father, and a sister
in curlers; all died. 
A wood frame house,
a cannister of oil,
a match—watch
as it unsettles.
They were so cold;
umber. 
       4
I am away from the knowledge
of animal mystics,
brujas and sorcerers
or the nudging chants
of a Tlingit Kachina.
I am frightened by regions
with wills of their own,
but when my people
die in the snow
I wonder
did the depths billow up
to reach them?

after García Lorca



Once I wasn’t always so plain.
I was strewn feathers on a cross
of dune, an expanse of ocean
at my feet, garlands of gulls. 
   Sirens and gulls. They couldn’t tame you.
You know as well as they: to be
a dove is to bear the falcon
at your breast, your nights, your seas. 
   My fear is simple, heart-faced
above a flare of etchings, a lineage
in letters, my sudden stare. It’s you. 
   It’s you! sang the heart upon its mantel
pelvis. Blush of my breath, catch
of my see—beautiful bird—It’s you.

Did you sneeze? Yes, I rid myself of the imposter inside me. 
Did you iron your shirt? Yes, I used the steam of mother's hate. 
Did you wash your hands? Yes, I learned my hygiene from a raccoon. 
I prayed on my knees, and my knees answered with pain. I gargled. I polished my shoes until I saw who I was. I inflated my résumé by employing my middle name. 
I walked to my interview, early, The sun like a ring on an electric stove. I patted my hair when I entered the wind of a revolving door. The guard said, For a guy like you, it's the 19th floor. 
The economy was up. Flags whipped in every city plaza In America. This I saw for myself as I rode the elevator, Empty because everyone had a job but me. 
Did you clean your ears? Yes, I heard my fate in the drinking fountain's idiotic drivel.
Did you slice a banana into your daily mush? I added a pinch of salt, two raisins to sweeten my breath. 
Did you remember your pen? I remembered my fingers when the elevator opened. 
I shook hands that dripped like a dirty sea. I found a chair and desk. My name tag said my name. Through the glass ceiling, I saw the heavy rumps of CEOs. Outside my window, the sun was a burning stove, All of us pushing papers To keep it going.

My chalk is no longer than a chip of fingernail,
Chip by which I must explain this Monday
Night the verbs “to get;” “to wear,” “to cut.”
I’m not given much, these tired students,
Knuckle-wrapped from work as roofers,
Sour from scrubbing toilets and pedestal sinks.
I’m given this room with five windows,
A coffee machine, a piano with busted strings,
The music of how we feel as the sun falls,
Exhausted from keeping up.
                                       I stand at
The blackboard. The chalk is worn to a hangnail,
Nearly gone, the dust of some educational bone.
By and by I’m Cantiflas, the comic
Busybody in front. I say, “I get the coffee.”
I pick up a coffee cup and sip.
I click my heels and say, “I wear my shoes.”
I bring an invisible fork to my mouth
And say, “I eat the chicken.”
Suddenly the class is alive—
Each one putting on hats and shoes,
Drinking sodas and beers, cutting flowers
And steaks—a pantomime of sumptuous living. 
At break I pass out cookies.
Augustine, the Guatemalan, asks in Spanish,
“Teacher, what is ‘tally-ho’?”
I look at the word in the composition book.
I raise my face to the bare bulb for a blind answer.
I stutter, then say, “Es como adelante.”
Augustine smiles, then nudges a friend
In the next desk, now smarter by one word.
After the cookies are eaten,
We move ahead to prepositions—
“Under,” “over,” and “between,”
Useful words when la migra opens the doors
Of their idling vans.
At ten to nine, I’m tired of acting,
And they’re tired of their roles.
When class ends, I clap my hands of chalk dust,
And two students applaud, thinking it’s a new verb.
I tell them adelante,
And they pick up their old books.
They smile and, in return, cry, “Tally-ho.”
As they head for the door.

Two guitars were left in a room all alone
They sat on different corners of the parlor
In this solitude they started talking to each other
My strings are tight and full of tears
The man who plays me has no heart
I have seen it leave out of his mouth
I have seen it melt out of his eyes
It dives into the pores of the earth
When they squeeze me tight I bring
Down the angels who live off the chorus
The trios singing loosen organs
With melodious screwdrivers
Sentiment comes off the hinges
Because a song is a mountain put into
Words and landscape is the feeling that
Enters something so big in the harmony
We are always in danger of blowing up
With passion
The other guitar:
In 1944 New York
When the Trio Los Panchos started
With Mexican & Puerto Rican birds
I am the one that one of them held
Tight    like a woman
Their throats gardenia gardens
An airport for dreams
I've been in theaters and cabarets
I played in an apartment on 102nd street
After a baptism pregnant with women
The men flirted and were offered
Chicken soup
Echoes came out of hallways as if from caves Someone is opening the door now
The two guitars hushed and there was a
Resonance in the air like what is left by
The last chord of a bolero.

What the scale tells you is how much the earth
has missed you, body, how it wants you back
again after you leave it to go forth 
into the light. Do you remember how
earth hardly noticed you then? Others would rock
you in their arms, warm in the flow 
that fed you, coaxed you upright. Then earth began
to claim you with spots and fevers, began to lick
at you with a bruised knee, a bloody shin, 
and finally to stoke you, body, drumming
intimate coded messages through music
you danced to unawares, there in your dreaming 
and your poems and your obedient blood.
Body, how useful you became, how lucky,
heavy with news and breakage, rich, and sad, 
sometimes, imagining that greedy zero
you must have been, that promising empty sack
of possibilities, never-to-come tomorrow. 
But look at you now, body, soft old shoe
that love wears when it’s stirring, look down, look
how earth wants what you weigh, needs what you know.

4TH CENTURY B.C. 
How beautiful, my wellbeloved, is your body of granite—
It smites my eyes like an army with banners.
Your lips are the red wine poured from goatskin bags,
Your brows are warriors' full-drawn bows,
Your glances the arrows they shoot therefrom,
And your hair is the mane of a lion, tawny and thick. 
17TH CENTURY 
Let us not love tonight past mind
But stifle our intent
Lest blazing passion, unconfined,
Provoke imperilment. 
Against the dark, our fierce desire
Would flare too bright for sight,
So must we tame our blinding fire
And bank it for the night. 
With luminating dawn's return
And appetite's increase
Our lusty flame can safely burn
In furious release. 
18TH CENTURY 
Since even modest airs and prudish dress
May not deter rash beaux from wantonness,
Can your unsullied innocence o'ervault
Concupiscent intention to assault?
My sweet, have no misgivings, for you wear
So plainly insurmountable an air
That ogling lechers, hunting am'rous game,
Will blush, apologize, and flee in shame. 
19TH CENTURY 
Ethereal nightingale, gallantly singing
Your heart out in rich melodies
To insentient stones, earless trees,
And indifferent insects, forsake them! Go winging
To town like a dart to the mark, I implore you,
And, serving as courier bird,
Tell her who is waiting this word:
"I'm locked in my room and can't come but adore you."

Yes, I've been in Rome, at least two times,though on second thought it probably wasthree or maybe five. When was the last?That's easy, for I remember it exactly—at least what it was like when I first left.You mean a part of you remains in Rome?
Not really, for when I was first in RomeI was truly there. That ended the second time,though I only realized it when I first left.So when you were in Rome your last time wasconsumed by thoughts of leaving? Not exactly.As time went on, I came around at last,
thinking: obsess about leaving and nothing lasts;I'll end up never having been in Rome.Yet back then did you know just what exactlyit meant to be in Rome during that timeyou thought about leaving, even if it wasthen you saw what you'd lose if you had left?
Even at the time when I first leftI'd no idea. But you're not saying the lastyou saw of Rome was your third visit, for wasn'tit earlier that you felt you'd never leave Rome?No, all that happened there my second time,though to this day I feel about Rome exactly
what I felt from the first. What that means exactlyis hard to say, for perhaps I never left,since after all, my being there the first timedidn't involve my leaving. Tell me then, at last,was it once or twice? were you really in Rome?Why certainly—I'm sure, I know I was,
and on top of that you might even say I wasthere time and again, everything there exactlyjust the same, or like my last time in Rome,me feeling as if I'd never really left.But tell me now precisely, was the lastyou saw of Rome indeed that second time?
To be exact, it happened the very first timethat I saw Rome, darkness falling as I leftcausing me to see what simply couldn't last.

Haze of wave spume towards Small Point, 
    Seguin Island Light like a whale's spout— maybe life washes itself here, cools off. 
    It never comes clean. See all the sails up and full in the windy parade of skin 
    and sand and brine. Soon the rocks will pluck each wave's feathers. Soon the beach 
    like the moon, waning, will be 1/8th its size. Somewhere else—maybe Ireland—the tide 
    will bottom out then. For now the sun blesses the bodies at home in theirs, 
    and those less so, to ruin and ruin's aftermath— whatever that is—and the waves rolling in, 
    little snowplows, nimbus in miniature; how the beach fishhooks east, one child— 
    is that mine, or some spirit I was one more usher of?—face up, arms and legs 
    scraping a temporary angel in the sand.

In my great grandmother's time,  All one needed was a broom  To get to see places  And give the geese a chase in the sky.                  •  The stars know everything,  So we try to read their minds.  As distant as they are,  We choose to whisper in their presence.                  •  Oh Cynthia,  Take a clock that has lost its hands  For a ride.  Get me a room at Hotel Eternity  Where Time likes to stop now and then.                  •  Come, lovers of dark corners,  The sky says,  And sit in one of my dark corners.  There are tasty little zeroes  In the peanut dish tonight.

I wake to the sound of water, and think, "Mother has died and gone to France," She is at un autre hôtel, speaking French better than ever, while I stare at the fog that has a river in it—the broad Dordogne, making its river noise, as if all the faucets have been left on all night. The river rushing in one direction only, so different from Blackfish Creek, where the sea floods in and back, scrubbing the sand both ways. 
Well, one travels so things are different. American actors speak French on TV here. Last night they showed Accident Catastrophe about two babies switched in the hospital at birth. One dies. The parents discover the dead child was someone else's and their child is alive in Florida with son père, though sa mère est morte de some disease, who knows? 
Anyway, Ed Asner, who plays the lawyer, speaks gravelly French, but people have an American demeanor, they pull their hair on the edge of violence. Then each family gives up a piece, and the child ends up more loved than ever, as if it's inevitable. Or so the river is telling me with its one-way simplicity, like gravity. "Alive in the eternal heart of France"—that's Mother I'm thinking about, for some reason, 
maybe the journal my wife's been keeping, so like the daily letters Mother wrote to sa mère et son père, when her life was flowing through her like the broad Dordogne. And where is she now? Does she wish my father were with her, one of him alive, and one with her? A bell is ringing wildly, each of its peals like a round boat rolling downstream where the river divides around an island only to sweep back into itself somewhere in the fog.

For S. S.



She reads by the light of a guttering candle and likes the feel of each page's gilt edge as she lifts it slightly at the corner, readying 
herself to turn it. If the wind whips the sycamore branches outside her window, if her nightgowned shoulders shudder once 
from a sudden chill, so much the better, and the book must tell of children toiling for bread and pennies in a textile mill, 
or tender brothers doomed to sharpen their bayonets in opposing armies, or a family of refugees, dust 
in their mouths, gazing with longing at the far shore of a river. And I long only to be the author of that book she reads 
whose page glows from the same dim flame that illuminates her face, the author whose thought she contemplates 
as she touches a fingertip to a word to mark her place and turns her head toward the kettle that has begun to whistle.

Butter, like love, seems common enough yet has so many imitators. I held a brick of it, heavy and cool, and glimpsed what seemed like skin beneath a corner of its wrap; the décolletage revealed a most attractive fat! 
And most refined. Not milk, not cream, not even crème de la crème. It was a delicacy which assured me that bliss follows agitation, that even pasture daisies through the alchemy of four stomachs may grace a king's table. 
We have a yellow bowl near the toaster where summer's butter grows soft and sentimental. We love it better for its weeping, its nostalgia for buckets and churns and deep stone wells, for the press of a wooden butter mold shaped like a swollen heart.

My first day leading the prison writing workshop: Carlos
complimented my choosing the chair nearest the door. 
I read a poem by Whitman that once sent me hitchhiking
and Carlos stood up, asked to read a section from his four hundred-page work-in-progress, 
a poem that turns on his first finding Neruda's "One Year Walk";
he said it lit up the night like a perfect crime, so I left everything—  I had no choice—walked three thousand miles to the Pacific.
From memory he recited a passage in which his father left the family 
a small fortune, all counterfeit: though I doubted the facts, I can still see
that worn briefcase, almost-perfect hundreds stacked neatly in shrink-wrapped packs. 
I was young, it took me two weeks to accept that I could teach this lifer
nothing. World of concrete floors and everlasting light: 
he was grateful to God who gave him a blazing mind not granted to anyone living or dead,
and wouldn't have changed a word anyway.

For Nelly Sachs



It wasn't the earth that swallowed them. Was it the air? Numerous as the sand, they did not become sand, but came to naught instead. They've been forgotten in droves. Often, and hand in hand,        like minutes. More than us, but without memorials. Not registered, not cipherable from dust, but vanished— their names, spoons, and footsoles.        They don't make us sorry. Nobody can remember them: Were they born, did they flee, have they died? They were not missed. The world is airtight yet held together by what it does not house, by the vanished. They are everywhere.        Without the absent ones, there would be nothing. Without the fugitives, nothing is firm. Without the forgotten, nothing for certain.        The vanished are just. That's how we'll fade, too.   * * *   Für Nelly Sachs  Nicht die Erde hat sie verschluckt. War es die Luft? Wie der Sand sind sie zahireich, doch nicht zu Sand sind sie geworden, sondern zu nichte. In Scharen sind sie vergessen. Häufig und Hand in Hand,        wie die Minuten. Mehr als wir, doch ohne Andenken. Nicht verzeichnet, nicht abzulesen im Staub, sondern verschwunden sind ihre Namen, Löffel und Sohlen.        Sie reuen uns nicht. Es kann sich niemand auf sie besinnen: Sind sie geboren, geflohen, gestorben? Vermißt sind sie nicht worden. Lückenlos ist die Welt, doch zusammengehalten von dem was sie nicht behaust, von den Verschwundenen. Sie sind überall.        Ohne die Abwesenden wäre nichts da. Ohne die Flüchtigen wäre nichts fest. Ohne die Vergessenen nichts gewiß.        Die Verschwundenen sind gerecht. So verschallen wir auch.

When I dare at last to imagine hunger,see farmer wandering his parched fieldsknowing nothing to do, finally, but sleepthe day out in the barn's long shadow,dreaming of the family dog he drovedeep into a neighboring countyand abandoned by the side of the road.Weeks later a boy finds it in a ditch—timid and gimp, a halo of gnatsfestering between its swollen testiclesand wormy flanks—and he coaxes itinto some pines, tethers it with a tentstakeand a chain as the late summer lightspirals and drapes over the branches,a mirage the dog slavers and snaps at.Consider the boy's amusementas he imagines the animal jerking the lightdown and the ruckus of bells that clangand catapult from the treetop belfries,the canopy rent like a piñata, spilling licoriceand circus peanuts, coins and fluttering dollar bills.The real possibilities are beyond him.The dog as a parable of pain or loss.Hunger as some small iridescent thing at workinside the animal, hovering around its heartthe way a lone dragonfly skirts the dry pond crater,dismantling the day—light unstitchedfrom dust, dust unbuckled from air.By now, the dog's given up, and the boywatches its tongue loll in the pine needles,the heave and fall of its stomach, its eyesfollowing birdflight in and out of the shade.Restless for something he cannot name,he imagines the music he might makeif he thumped the dog's belly like a drum.Imagines its eyes are the color of iron.Imagines the unimaginable and does it,the tire tool and the belly unwilling instruments,and the dog's caterwaul is not like musicat all and when night comes the cricketsongdulcifies nothing, the dog's bodyis just a body, is not paltry, is not glorified.What hunger is this that haunts the boy,that haunts the man sleeping in the shade?Watch as the dragonfly dips into his open mouthand keeps going, a blur between bone and sinew,a wet thread collapsing soft caverns of flesh,gone to where his body is a fieldhoned by sleeves of sunlight,to where the boy ceases to be and the man wakes.He knows what flits through him nowkeeps the time with its thrumming,carrying him away from himselfinto himself, to where the dog roves in the shadows—ravenous, luminous—its tail bobbingin the heat, a winnowing sliver of light.

My dog has died.
I buried him in the garden
next to a rusted old machine. 
Some day I'll join him right there,
but now he's gone with his shaggy coat,
his bad manners and his cold nose,
and I, the materialist, who never believed
in any promised heaven in the sky
for any human being,
I believe in a heaven I'll never enter.
Yes, I believe in a heaven for all dogdom
where my dog waits for my arrival
waving his fan-like tail in friendship. 
Ai, I'll not speak of sadness here on earth,
of having lost a companion
who was never servile.
His friendship for me, like that of a porcupine
withholding its authority,
was the friendship of a star, aloof,
with no more intimacy than was called for,
with no exaggerations:
he never climbed all over my clothes
filling me full of his hair or his mange,
he never rubbed up against my knee
like other dogs obsessed with sex. 
No, my dog used to gaze at me,
paying me the attention I need,
the attention required
to make a vain person like me understand
that, being a dog, he was wasting time,
but, with those eyes so much purer than mine,
he'd keep on gazing at me
with a look that reserved for me alone
all his sweet and shaggy life,
always near me, never troubling me,
and asking nothing. 
Ai, how many times have I envied his tail
as we walked together on the shores of the sea
in the lonely winter of Isla Negra
where the wintering birds filled the sky
and my hairy dog was jumping about
full of the voltage of the sea's movement:
my wandering dog, sniffing away
with his golden tail held high,
face to face with the ocean's spray. 
Joyful, joyful, joyful,
as only dogs know how to be happy
with only the autonomy
of their shameless spirit. 
There are no good-byes for my dog who has died,
and we don't now and never did lie to each other. 
So now he's gone and I buried him,
and that's all there is to it.

Blizzard to lilac. Dandelion
to leaf. Endless
variation of seasons I note 
in passing, smells
I cannot smell: rotting
gardens, feces, musk of cat.
These two 
run in front of me, golden
shoulder to patchwork, heads
lifted or lowered into 
scent, tongues lolling. Ears
damp with their own
spittle and each other's 
tell me, tethered a pace behind,
their journey's epic: tipping
forward to the familiar or
stranger's distant yap; angling 
to my breathing, whispered
praise, my slightest
suggestion. 
Ignored.
The shepherd
throws herself into 
any whirring wheel, to herd
the neighbor's tractor mower or
the UPS truck's packets
home; pulling her back, 
the golden's oblivious
ballast, instinct heading
always for the gutter's 
deepest puddle, her own way
within the forked leash's
one-foot range. As we pass, 
the clans set up
their barking, as if we
were news, gathering center 
of a congenial warning
din—mine answer with
disturbances of pace, an extra pull
or lollop, grins thrown 
slant-eyed over shoulders
until one hears a call
she can't ignore, surrenders 
to baying's ferocious
joy moving through
muscle and bone. Moving
storm, storm's eye: happy 
universes whirl in their skins
as I do in mine. Unknowable,
their fate. Mediums between
foreign principalities, they're tied 
to me, to each other, by my will,
by love; to that other realm
by song, and tooth, and blood.

The message I found on the Post-it note went thus: love truth; expect to be found out. Kid-style capitals proved I wrote it, but left no clue why I'd swelled into a fat 
clause no editor could edit; then, an entry on a shrink's list of patient slang for sex— her desk Norwegian teak, the mug of tea on which she had affixed her Post-it notes 
hot against her knuckle, their lips of stickum loosening . . . And yet, I knew the note to peel away at hour's end would terminate our sessions—cool as the draft her linen 
skirt was lifting to: Love, just stay benighted,  given everything I know you've got to hide.

Baudelaire: "The dead, the poor dead, have their bad hours." But the dead have no watches, no grief and no hours.  At first not smoking took all my time: I did it a little by little and hour by hour.     Per diem. Pro bono. Cui bono? Pro rata. But the poor use English. Off and on. By the hour.     "I'm sorry but we'll have to stop now." There tick but fifty minutes in the psychoanalytic hour.  Vengeance is mine, yours, his or hers, ours, yours again (you-all's this time), and then (yikes!) theirs. I prefer ours.  Twenty minutes fleeing phantoms at full tilt and then the cat coils herself like a quoit and sleeps for hours.

We are in the position of defining myth by the shape of its absence.
-Sean Kane, Wisdom of the Mythtellers



The bluebird's cold mistimed egg
fetched up from the one-legged
box after the pair had left for
points south & unknown (never,
as it turned out, to return) I
renested in the half-geode by
the windowsill where it gleamed
&, months becoming years, seemed
about to last forever, grow more
consistent with itself, holding its pure
blue firmament up over what by now
was nothing, till one January day, snow
melting to a fast flood,
I blew it softly onto my palm so I could
hold its cerulean up against new sky,
home against home, where it lay
weightless & delicate as the Xmas ornament
we'd just put away, but when I went
to roll it gently back onto its bed,
& leave it there, I saw a thread,
a crack, another, watched it sink in
slowly on itself, shard on shard collapsing
from my touch & breath, relaxing
into the shape of its absence

Mark Young is a New Zealander who has lived most of his life in Australia, and he is known primarily as a poet. As a visual poet, he brings a vibrant literary sense to the text as visual object. He has arrayed phrases and individual words upon a field that takes the form of a traditional chess set, compelling the reader to construct meaning out of the various ways a string of words can be constructed. The reader can read up, down, diagonally, and even in a continuous spiral. In the end, the poem becomes a textual movie—every block upon the page a single frame in that movie—and the film flickers before us, sending our minds in different directions, exciting the retina, and teasing the mind. Meaning is not easy or certain in this visual poem. Instead, it surges toward us and swirls away, both brazen and coy. This is a poem about thinking, meaning, and the isolated and collective beauty of words.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry > >

What am I to you now that you are no
longer what you used to be to me? 
Who are we to each other now that
there is no us, now that what we once 
were is divided into me and you
who are not one but two separate and 
unrelated persons except for that ex-
that goes in front of the words 
that used to mean me, used to mean
you, words we rarely used (husband, wife) 
as when we once posed (so young and helpless)
with our hands (yours, mine) clasped on the knife 
that was sinking into the tall white cake.
All that sweetness, the layers of one thing 
and then another, and then one thing again.

the relationship between         blackbird and fencepost, between  the cow and its egret, the field         and wildflowers overrunning the field—  so little depends upon their trust.

[SAROUK] 
We buy what we cannot control, the rugs,
rhythm-makers, containing refrains of
the oldest story: a man takes a journey.
I have no stories inside me, he says,
so travels on, to rest beneath a carpet
of blue constellations, star patterns
at the edges of disordered border walls.
At the center, a meditative medallion
makes a moving immortal-flowered ground:
to live there is to give oneself over
to greenness, redness, occasional blues,
holding those spirits of woollen dyes
rising from the knots within to breathe
against the woven, multi-colored air.  
[BIDJAR] 
Now there is a coat of many colors hung
around the wanderer's shoulders where
he climbs out from that pit, down which
he flung himself, or was thrown into.
Reaching to soothe his wounds, he finds
the dusts of centuries residing there
beneath his feet, the hopeful travelers
passing, wearing thin, fighting about
how best to articulate the names of gods
for whom they yearn—accursed by wars'
helmet curves, shields, chained stitches
of unmediated reds and yellowed husks
of blood—broken lines marking a garden
in whose precincts his journey began.  
[KAZAK] 
Three sunbursts spin, enigmatic energies
through golden latchhooks, surrounding
cloudbanks; three eagles, darting within
their shifting images: they return him
to streets of lit porches in summer dark,
a boy stuttering over random syllables,
a blindfolded man pleading for his life—
whose fate is in the hands of some men
whose fate is in the hands of other men,
whose fate . . . until the whole pattern
emerges, and the language becomes clear.
On the floor lies his mother, moaning,
until he comes out, guilty, before her—
amid the mud of his own frozen blood.  
[SHIRVAN] 
To live inside such squares as the weaver
of this green, becoming golden, labor;
to pull back old skins and try to emerge,
victorious, from that old prison after
so many years, is to find a path back to
harmonious designs, surely centered on
the search—yet still speaking of a life
with knotted figures seen as suffering
variations on themes that can be inferred
from small vibrations of weft and warp,
the ‘snakes' within the threads worn down
to the shapes of ribbons, even rhythms
writhing in a loom of days: those humming
ancient instruments whose music seems  
[SHIRAZ] 
raw as colors governed by the earth, pink
as brick, or deserts scraped from rock,
rough clay slowly grinding, then drifting
down the slopes of the central plateaus
to fresh respites from thinner regions of
dessication fixed at the fringes below.
These lands lie under the ache of desire,
which calls feet out to play upon sand,
to fill each new hollow, and dance about,
tongues turning on the knots of umber,
ochre, woven into those undulating waves
others might summon in flowery manners
to escape from bitter orange, still held
by recalcitrant fingers, to the purple  
[KERMAN] 
empowering all those who try to hold on—
as all things will hold to themselves
an idea of themselves—to an aspiration
towards good fortune, unwavering even
unto death. Yet here are dusky passages,
canopies of clearness, an everlasting
understanding of the earth as cancerous
points of coloration, acid starbursts,
or dangerous blots—all blurring the way
to move past sight: perspectives lost
and found again, symmetrical, surrounded
by the momentos one saves from travel,
old friends, like hues that may betoken,
in hopefulness, some changes of heart.  
[SENNEH] 
This creates a powerful language about
how to levitate a plane—for even as
the occasional murmurs of new machines
are heard in the land, as old cyclic
gardens arrange themselves in the whorls
and tendrils throughout tilled fields,
snakes hold up this world in variations
of light blue skies above temptation.
Even when an illiterate weaver mistakes
an old date for the design, then dyes
and binds strange numbers into a ground,
the change of the serif, for instance,
in a calligraphy of days marks the date
of cartouches as mysterious, unknown.  
[KASHAN] 
Yet the signals from the borders suggest
a different tale: lozenges are bottles
strewn along mauve and terra cotta roads,
shaped like a woman found lying along
the side of those same roads—the figure
of flesh, going nowhere but endlessly
back on itself—as a web of years frames
a dying kind of certitude, innocence.
The birds in these cages signify singing,
as the tapestries of perfected threads
suggest reticence, chosen intermediaries
to the indeterminancy of all creation: 
and we can buy it yet, articulate or not,
with each new freeing of our hearts.

It may seem morbid of an embezzler to keep a memorandum, yet many of them do. It may be mere neatness.          -Wallace Stevens, "Surety and Fidelity Claims"



I've made a little sluice-gate in the flow of cash across the spreadsheet on my screen. Amid torrential chaos and foreseen disasters it maintains its small and slow on-off diversions, so my work can show the delicacy of difference between the beans I count and one uncounted bean, and where the latter might invisibly go. 
The hollowed shoe-tree, the hermetic jar are gadgetry I might revert to yet. There is the money of the thing, the far secure retirement years, the deep-hedged bet, but I love working where the unknowns are, and writing down what I need to forget.

I tie my Hat—I crease my Shawl—
Life's little duties do—precisely
As the very least
Were infinite—to me—
—Emily Dickinson, #443



My mother’s mother, widowed very young
of her first love, and of that love’s first fruit,
moved through her father’s farm, her country tongue
and country heart anaesthetized and mute
with labor. So her kind was taught to do—
“Find work,” she would reply to every grief—
and her one dictum, whether false or true,
tolled heavy with her passionate belief.
Widowed again, with children, in her prime,
she spoke so little it was hard to bear
so much composure, such a truce with time
spent in the lifelong practice of despair.
But I recall her floors, scrubbed white as bone,
her dishes, and how painfully they shone.

They must set out for town.A few will be allowed to return later.But most of them are still hanging around out there.Who knows what will become of them. Before theyFind their peace.

Cecil Touchon’s work is radically post-textual, yet encumbered by nothing but text and the space surrounding it. His technique, as demonstrated aptly here, is to dismantle physical pages of text and reconstitute them in ways that enhance the visual continuities of text and undermine their meaningful sequentiality. This is the ultimate form of deconstruction, a literal (in the hand, of the letter) slicing of the page into pieces that Touchon repositions into a new jigsaw puzzle, different than the one that he began with. This piece is particularly austere, presenting only three colors for our consideration: a mottled white, a red-brown, and a glimpse of black peeking through from the base of the collage. We are invited to consider this poem as a piece of writing transmogrified into a visual field through which we might glimpse what it means to be text, to understand text, and to inhabit text.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry > >

Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore, Verona



A chubby fist and wing float free, severed from the landscape of human affairs. 
Below, a barefoot saint seems to straddle acres, beaming casual self-possession, the divine 
right to stake eternal claim—but in the space between both legs, a third intrudes, 
last remnant of a man fading to white dust. Nine hundred years ago this wall was his. Reduced 
to a toehold, he now spites the fourteenth-century arriviste, holding his ground with the ghost 
of what he was. The saint remains oblivious. Centuries sweep around him like planets' rings; 
the church's wheel-of-fortune spins rose light through plague and war. 
Yet so vivid are his blue and russet robes, he glistens—a refugee 
from a sun shower who's arrived dripping wet, an idea fresh from the brush of his maker.

From here into the north, the ways are dry. Yellow grass, thirst in the roots. In the hearts. It's all simple, but false.      When I try to think history, the enormous vertebrae of the dinosaur behind the purple beeches in Invalidenstrasse, Bismarck in marble, and Benn, a nameplate on Bozener, lifeless.      In the depths of the bunkers on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin are the shoes of Hitler's favorite horse. Profile of power: armor and helmet. In our pants pockets, we crumple the banners. Full of satisfaction we hear the flags splinter in the fabric's darkness.      Don't forget the poets' loaded dice. When iron rules again, we will have to console ourselves, adorn stones with smaller stones, the heart with water.       * * *   Von hier in den Norden sind die Wege trocken. Gelbes Gras, Durst in den Wurzeln. Im Herzen. Alles ist einfach, aber falsch.

In den Tiefen der Bunker des Potsdamer Platzes in Berlin liegen die Hufeisen von Hitlers Lieblingspferd. Profile der Macht: Harnisch und Helm. In der Hosentasche zerknicken wir die Standarten. Voll Genugtuung hören wir die Fahnen splittern im Dunkel des Stoffs.      Vergeßt nicht die gefälschten Würfel der Dichter. Wenn die Eisernen wieder herrschen, werden wir uns trösten müssen, Steine schmücken mit kleinen Steinen, mit Wasser das Herz.

This is a poem about the great ships that wandered                    the oceans And groaned sometimes in deep voices, grumbling about fog                    and submerged peaks, But usually they sliced the pages of tropical seas                    in silence, Divided by height, category, and class, just like our communities                    and hotels. Beneath the deck poor emigrants played cards, and no one                    won While on the highest deck Claudel gazed at Ysé and her hair                    glowed.  And toasts were raised to a safe trip, to coming                    times, Toasts were raised, Alsatian wine and champagne                    from France's finest vineyards, Some days were static, windless, when only the light seeped                          steadily, Days when nothing happened but the horizon, which traveled                      with the ship, Days of emptiness and boredom, playing solitaire, repeating                      the latest news, Who'd been seen with whom in a tropical night's shade, embracing                      beneath a peach-colored moon.  But filthy stokers tirelessly tossed coal into open                      flaming mouths And everything that is now already existed then, but                   in condensed form. Our days already existed and our hearts baked                    in the blazing stove, And the moment when I met you may also have existed,                   and my mistrust Brittle as a faience plate, and my faith, no less frail                     and capricious, And my searches for the final answer, my                   disappointments and discoveries.       Great ships: some sunk suddenly, arousing consciences                   and fear, Gaining deathless fame, becoming stars                 of special bulletins. Others went peacefully, waned without a word in provincial                   ports, in dockyards, Beneath a coat of rust, a ruddy fur of rust, a slipcover of rust,                 and waited For the final transformation, the last judgment of souls and                 objects, They wait as patiently as chess players in Luxembourg Garden                 nudging pieces a fraction of an inch or so.

The long road south, the pavement flat  and black as a dash without end, no signs,   no houses, the heat like an unseen fog  and the sun a swollen crimson clot  above fields where frazzle-haired palm trees rose  sporadic and unwieldy, the miles   of pasture where cattle of every conceivable  color, rust and tobacco and ashen, fed   and nursed their stumbling young,  heavy heads bent to the ground.   And insects that crashed against windshield  so tiny, no body was left behind.   Then a wooden shack where we stopped to pee    and the shock of iron-red flecks against   bowl, the water placid, unmoved.  There was hardly any pain.   What could we do but continue on  as scattered street-lamps gradually revealed   a landscape inhabited once again: the still     shuttered windows of bungalows pink   as scrubbed flesh, the small dark yards of abandoned  Bigwheels and plots of petunias or cukes,   the closed, expectant mailboxes  and the living already dead inside me.

Because it hadn't seemed enough, after a while, to catalogue more Christmases, the three-layer cakes ablaze with birthday candles, the blizzard Billy took a shovel to, Phil's lawnmower tour of the yard, the tree forts, the shoot-'em-ups between the boys in new string ties and cowboy hats and holsters, or Mother sticking a bow as big as Mouseketeer ears in my hair,  my father sometimes turned the gaze of his camera to subjects more artistic or universal: long closeups of a rose's face; a real-time sunset (nearly an hour); what surely were some brilliant autumn leaves before their colors faded to dry beige on the aging film; a great deal of pacing, at the zoo, by polar bears and tigers caged, he seemed to say, like him.  What happened between him and her is another story. And just as well we have no movie of it, only some unforgiving scowls she gave through terrifying, ticking silence when he must have asked her (no sound track) for a smile. Still, what I keep yearning for isn't those generic cherry blossoms at their peak, or the brave daffodil after a snowfall,  it's the re-run surprise of the unshuttered, prefab blanks of windows at the back of the house, and how the lines of aluminum siding are scribbled on with meaning only for us who lived there; it's the pair of elephant bookends I'd forgotten, with the upraised trunks like handles, and the books they meant to carry in one block to a future that scattered all of us.  And look: it's the stoneware mixing bowl figured with hand-holding dancers handed down so many years ago to my own kitchen, still valueless, unbroken. Here she's happy, teaching us to dye the Easter eggs in it, a Grecian urn of sorts near which—a foster child of silence and slow time myself—I smile because she does and patiently await my turn.

(to remind myself)



i    Make a place to sit down.   Sit down. Be quiet.   You must depend upon   affection, reading, knowledge,   skill—more of each   than you have—inspiration,   work, growing older, patience,   for patience joins time   to eternity. Any readers   who like your poems,   doubt their judgment.     ii    Breathe with unconditional breath   the unconditioned air.   Shun electric wire.   Communicate slowly. Live   a three-dimensioned life;   stay away from screens.   Stay away from anything   that obscures the place it is in.   There are no unsacred places;   there are only sacred places   and desecrated places.     iii    Accept what comes from silence.   Make the best you can of it.   Of the little words that come   out of the silence, like prayers   prayed back to the one who prays,   make a poem that does not disturb   the silence from which it came.

Three days later, Suljic was finally given a drink
of water and marched with a dozen other men
onto a small livery truck, one of two, fenced
along each side by wooden planks, 
the back left open to give a clear shot
to the automatic weapon poking out the window
of the red sedan that followed, the squat nose
trained on them, ridiculously, as if they'd any thought 
of hopping off a moving truck. Suljic peered
vacantly through the slats. He'd missed the yellow flowers
of Spring and by now saw a landscape taken over
by Summer, the grasses closing behind them as they veered 
from the road and lurched across cow paths. They drove
to the center of a wide field and stopped. Old sweat,
without the breeze of movement, prickled in the heat.
A metal smell drifted, an untended apple grove 
baked on a hill, and the weeds droned, motory with bees.
But Suljic noticed none of these, fixed instead
on the gaps in the field where bodies, all dead,
matted down the wild carrot and chicory, their khakis 
splotched darkly, like a fawn's dappled haunches
obscuring them. The men clambered down into the tall grass
and lined up at gunpoint. Suljic was sure the last
good thing he'd ever see would be the apple branches 
drooping with fruit, but the man beside him grabbed
his hand, and looked him in the face, as if
Suljic, just a bricklayer, had any assurances to give.
He squeezed the hand back, hard, and felt a scab 
crossing the man's knuckles. He saw, too, a thin scar
worrying the arch of his left eyebrow, much older,
perhaps from a fall as a child from a ladder
picking fruit. His hand was like a clump of mortar, 
and three nights without sleep had webbed his eyes red.
And Suljic suddenly stuttered to ask his name,
what town was he from, his job—anything—but there came
the crackle, like sometimes thunder, undecided 
whether to begin, that starts, stalls, then trips
over itself, the sound crinkling from one
end of the sky to the other. The sound took possession
of his face until it, too, crinkled, his grip 
pulsed, and he fell forward. Suljic winced
in the tackle of bodies, and splayed down in the dirt
flattening himself like a beetle, not hurt
in any new way, not yet convinced 
he wasn't dead and didn't feel it. He heard the click
of fresh clips sliding into place, and shut
his eyes lightly, sure someone had seen he wasn't shot
and would come finish it. But no one came. Another truck 
rolled up. The men climbed down, and lined up, docilely.
He recognized, solely by rhythm, a prayer, cut off
by the crackle, the hush of crickets, the soft
whump of bodies folding at the knees 
and knocked by bullets shoulder first
into the grass. No one yelled. No one tried to run.
Another truck, another group, falling like a succession
of bricks sliding off a hod. Suljic finally pissed 
where he lay, and blended in all the better
with the others. The noise stopped, and he cracked
his eyes enough to see, across the backs
like bleeding hills, a man strolling along the scatter 
of bodies with a pistol, putting a slug
into the skull of anyone that still twitched
or mumbled. Then came the snort and low-pitched
rumble of diesel engines as two backhoes dug 
a trench along the margin of all the collapsed
bodies. Impossibly, the crackling started anew,
and when darkness finally settled, the squads continued
in what light the backhoes' headlights threw. Perhaps 
the shooting was over long before the sound
left him, the crackle to his eardrums
was like the rolling of a boat to his limbs
echoing long after he'd reached dry ground. 
The soldiers left. Still he didn't move, but eased
his eyes full open. The moon above the orchard
was shrinking higher, its light glossing the awkward
pale forms that stubbled the dry weeds, 
glinting off teeth and eyes. He scuttled from beneath
the arms and legs flopped sleepingly over
his own, as though by drunkards or lovers,
and rose like a foal to his numb feet, 
seeing throughout the field no man not touched
by three dead others. He stood for a moment, trying
to guess, even roughly, their number, multiplying
bodies per square yard, but the math was too much, 
the count too huge. He stared at the faces beside him
in the grass, like a man leaving something he knew
he would someday have to return to,
looking for the landmarks that would guide him— 
the crooked teeth, the welted cheek, the pale eyes eclipsed
by half-shut lids, lolling upward, inward, swollen
as though with weeping, blood from an unseen hole
glistering down a chin line, crusting on lips. 
How could he explain his life, what could he say
to those who weren't here to see, to the mothers and wives
who'd swear for years their men were still alive,
somewhere, the bodies never found, bulldozed into clay— 
would he tell them how he tiptoed, unable to avoid
stepping on hands and ankles, or how the tears
like a secret he'd harbored through three years
of siege shook loose, and how he let them, no longer afraid 
of being found out and cut down by gunfire,
or how he ran anyway, when he reached the open, quick
as his bum leg would let him, without a look
back at the faces turned like gourds in the dark mire.

One death comesbefore another.Breath and smoke.And smoke which puts out breath.And silence.
But sometimes only a cigarettehelps you keep your grip. And keepsits promises more quickly, too.Between yellowed fingersit burns like love becomes asheslike betrayal. Breath and smoke.
The three fingers of oath curvedaround the cigarette: tonot forswear.Giordano burns on the Campo de Fiori.The bells of Santa Maria Maggioreare still pealing for the auto-da-fé.
Breath and smoke.And smoke which puts out breath.And to write witha burned hand about fire.And the borders of the German languageare mined with murderous accidents.One death comes before another.
 * * *
 Ein Tod kommtvor dem andern.Atem und Rauch.Und Rauch der Atem löscht.Und Schweigen.
Manchmal ist aber eine Zigaretteder letzte Halt. Und hältwas sie verspricht auch schneller.Zwischen vergilbten Fingernbrennts wie Liebe wird Aschewie Verrat. Atem und Rauch.
Die Schwurfinger gekrümmtum die Zigarette: umnicht abzuschwören.Giordano brennt auf dem Campo de Fiori.Die Glocken von Santa Maria Maggioregellen noch immer zum Autodafé.
Atem und Rauch.Und Rauch der Atem löscht.Und mit verbrannter Handüber das Feuer schreiben.Und die Grenzen der deutschen Sprachesind mit mörderischen Zufällen vermint.Ein Tod kommt dem andern zuvor.

Something expired. At the turning, A spirit was gone. That which was Turned to sepia: high collars, punting, Waxed mustaches, parasols. 
From bridges, children stared in the river And felt themselves, also, halved. Old manners were patently over. New manners had not yet arrived. 
The old, without waiting to speak Their parting lines in the act, Learned to exit the way of pipe-smoke. Uttered nothing. Utter tact. 
Steamy ghosts rose from horses' Maws as they champed at their bits. The ladies reached for their purses. The gentlemen tipped their hats.

I have become the smaller flag on a ship, the shorter rafters of a roof, a knave in a pack of cards. I wear a skimpy coat, tall leather boot, and leather drinking flask. I am captured in a child's game and hit when grown men gamble. I am what they call a tame ape.
I was a common man whose job was to lift weight. Mechanical devices that replaced my muscles took my job and pay and more—they took my human name. And I, who used to pull my master's boots, hoist meat and turn the spit, work the roller and the winch, climb the steeple, strike the bell and connect lines in telephone exchange, am a daw, the tiniest of crows, gathering loose sticks to nest in castle ruins. 
The solace of six centuries—and still—is once, on a high and windy hill, beside a well that was clear and full, I kissed a girl named Gylle.

I sometimes find him in the attic,
lying on his side, contemplating
the insulation. Or just staring at 
the beams, trying to get the measure
of force and distribution. He
turns up a lot in the garage. 
I know he loves me. But if I look
away for an instant, he's off,
and I worry that he won't come back 
(or when he does he'll have no taste,
gone in for some fad I'll have to bear,
and every move he makes a test). 
But usually he's charming,
following me to the cafe
and lying on the awning so carefully 
as not to make it sag, only
casting a slight shadow on my table.
Of course I act as though I 
haven't seen a thing. He only wants,
I think, to do what can't be done.
Why just yesterday, for instance, 
I found him going through the public trash,
figuring how to fill a bottle
some angry drunk had smashed.

It's not exile, homes and families behind us, where we meet. It happens anywhere, 
         now: a stateless state of no name, quietly seceding from the crumbling empires round us, 
without stamps or Eurovision entries. No-one does it with a rough guide in a week. 
         You inhabit it or nothing. Like this: in a pavement cafe you blink and you seem to surprise them, 
the crowd, all its separate faces at once, coming out of solution like crystals, 
         like a rush of starlings or the breeze that lifts the canvas awning now and dents your cappuccino froth 
with a crisp little sound. And that's it: between breaths, just between you and me 
         as if; yes, QED. You are received. This is the freedom of the city, and the key 
to the kingdom, and its borders ripple outwards like a frill of breaking wave 
         onto flat sand, a wavering line already fading leaving spume-flecks high and dry, 
a prickling on your palm; you're five years old, looking up at the whole sea, 
         unsure: 
                  will you laugh or cry?

Take hold of the bitter end; pass carefully around the standing part, being mindful of the bight. Finish with a round turn, make the knot up tight and it will not slip under load. 
But you'll find it not so easily undone; dangerous in the dark and cold and wet, when it matters most. These knots command allegiances. 
The Turk's head and midshipman's bend, the lighterman's hitch and the hangman's noose. See what names mean: Knots are men. 
Facing page—a simple eye-splice. Apply a whipping at the end so no strands come loose in the braid. The knot will hold Anything you care to bind.

I don't know how it happened, but I fell—   and I was immense, one dislocated arm   wedged between two buildings. I felt some ribs   had broken, perhaps a broken neck, too;   I couldn't speak. My dress caught bunched   about my thighs, and where my glasses shattered   there'd spread something like a seacoast, or maybe   it was a port. Where my hair tangled with power lines   I felt a hot puddle of blood.                                                      I must have passed out,   but when I woke, a crew of about fifty   was building a winding stairway beside my breast   and buttressing a platform on my sternum.   I heard, as through cotton, the noise of hammers,   circular saws, laughter, and some radio   droning songs about love. Out the corner   of one eye (I could open one eye a bit) I saw   my pocketbook, its contents scattered, my lipstick's   toppled silo glinting out of reach.   And then, waving a tiny flashlight, a man   entered my ear. I felt his boots sloshing   the blood trickling there. He never came out.   So some went looking, with flares, dogs, dynamite   even: they burst my middle ear and found   my skull, its cavern crammed with dark matter   like a cross between a fungus and a cloud.   They never found his body, though. And they never   found or tried to find an explanation,   I think, for me; they didn't seem to need one.   Even now my legs subdue that dangerous   sea, the water bright enough to cut   the skin, where a lighthouse, perched on the tip   of my great toe, each eight seconds rolls   another flawless pearl across the waves.   It keeps most ships from wrecking against my feet.   On clear days, people stand beside the light;   they watch the waves' blue heads slip up and down   and scan for landmarks on the facing shore.

We visit by phone as the morphine haze   retreats, late afternoon, most days.   Our mingled past is set against the pin-   hole lights of cars cruising the blacked-out streets:    we four in the college smoker popping No-Doz,   honors students carrying heavy course loads   tipped sideways by sex, one by one discarding   our virginities on the altar of inverse pride,    ironing our blouses with Peter Pan collars   to wear on dates with those 90-day Wonders,   ensigns in training for the Second World War   in the Business School across the Charles River.  We called ourselves the Unholy Four.   Whenever any three of us met on campus   we huddled to bray Austria! Russia! Prussia! in unison. It came out sounding like Horseshit!  Post graduation one year, look at us:   my new husband atop your even newer   one's car singing the bawdy verses   of "Roll Me Over" in a drunken tenor    while the scandalized uncles and aunties   —it wasn't enough that you'd wed a Chinese—   wrung their hands. You drove off   trailing Just Married in two languages.    Now BJ is gone, and Hettie. You have, they say,   only days. It is my plan to go with you   as far as the border. I've been that far—   Did I come back from there morally improved?    Somehow better equipped to support you   this side of the douane and wave,   your two cats curled like commas beside you   as the barrier lifts and you drive on through?

Monsignor, I believed Jesus followed me With his eyes, and when I slept, An angel peeled an orange And waited for me to wake up. This was 1962. I was ten, small as the flame Of a struck match, my lungs fiery From hard, wintery play. When I returned home, Legs hurting, I placed my hands on the windowsill And looked out—clouds dirty as towels And geese I have yet to see again Darkening the western sky.  Monsignor, a machine Had painted on the eyes of my toy soldier, Little dots off-center, Almost on his cheeks. Such a cheap toy, I drowned him over and over in my bath, Drowned him until the painted-on eyes flaked off. Then a leg fell off—surge of dirty water Sunk him to the bottom.  I now at this age place hands on the windowsill, My eyes nearly on my cheeks, My belly with its rising tide. There is no angel with an orange at the edge Of my bed. There is no soldier Of God. Only a pane between the inside And the outside, between this living And this dying. Monsignor, Saintly man of this child's wonderment, When will I see the geese again?

One of the objects I've treasured most in my life Is this letter scale which, long ago, you gave me. I was an active correspondent at the time, Even sending lots of letters overseas. While still enjoying the pleasure of going to the post, I now had another: assessing exactly, in advance, At my counter, the cost of packets and envelopes, To which, price list in hand, I stuck my stamps. I use it less these days, this quite simple device Graded with little marks up to a whole pound, For my mailings rarely still exceed the price Of an ordinary stamp. The tray of polished metal's now Covered with dust, without the slightest hint That the red pointer marking the weight on the front Has budged. But in the long run, one would, I think, Discern a difference and see how much the months Were worth in terms of dust, the seasons elapsed Since the previous weighing. But having been seized, Suddenly, just this morning, by a tremendous attack (Annual) of cleaning, from which nothing is released, I restored to the tray's slightly concave stainless steel, That ever so slightly distorted mirror, its polished shine. It reflected all of the sky, through which clouds reeled, And I could confirm that space does not weigh more than time.

The moon has its rain-ring auraed around it— The more that we think we understand, the less we see, Back yard becoming an obelisk Of darkness into the sky,                                      no hieroglyphs, no words to the wise.

They say you can jinx a poem
if you talk about it before it is done.
If you let it out too early, they warn,
your poem will fly away,
and this time they are absolutely right. 
Take the night I mentioned to you
I wanted to write about the madmen,
as the newspapers so blithely call them,
who attack art, not in reviews,
but with breadknives and hammers
in the quiet museums of Prague and Amsterdam. 
   Actually, they are the real artists,
you said, spinning the ice in your glass.
The screwdriver is their brush.
The real vandals are the restorers,
you went on, slowly turning me upside-down,
the ones in the white doctor's smocks
who close the wound in the landscape,
and thus ruin the true art of the mad. 
I watched my poem fly down to the front
of the bar and hover there
until the next customer walked in—
then I watched it fly out the open door into the night
and sail away, I could only imagine,
over the dark tenements of the city. 
All I had wished to say
was that art was also short,
as a razor can teach with a slash or two,
that it only seems long compared to life,
but that night, I drove home alone
with nothing swinging in the cage of my heart
except the faint hope that I might
catch a glimpse of the thing
in the fan of my headlights,
maybe perched on a road sign or a street lamp,
poor unwritten bird, its wings folded,
staring down at me with tiny illuminated eyes.

For R. L. B.



For all the far-flung continents he'd crossed, Revealing lands they found beyond belief; For all the roads that lay behind him, lost In caverns of some atavistic grief 
He'd carried with him since he was a boy; For all the years, he should be weary now. How then could he explain this welling joy, A old man on a wintry beach? Or how 
It seemed the wind bore perfumes of a whole New wilderness, a lush and green Brazil Over the dim horizon of his soul, Farther than memory, beyond his will, 
Where even now, in vibrant canopies, The twilight songs of bird to hidden bird Rose up in wild, untutored harmonies More lovely for their never being heard.

I'm Ramón González Barbagelata from anywhere,    from Cucuy, from Paraná, from Rio Turbio, from Oruro,   from Maracaibo, from Parral, from Ovalle, from Loconmilla,    I'm the poor devil from the poor Third World,    I'm the third-class passenger installed, good God!    in the lavish whiteness of snow-covered mountains,    concealed among orchids of subtle idiosyncrasy.     I've arrived at this famous year 2000, and what do I get? With what do I scratch myself? What do I have to do with    the three glorious zeros that flaunt themselves    over my very own zero, my own non-existence?    Pity that brave heart awaiting its call    or the man enfolded by warmer love,    nothing's left today except my flimsy skeleton,    my eyes unhinged, confronting the era's beginning.     The era's beginning: are these ruined shacks,    these poor schools, these people still in rags and tatters,    this cloddish insecurity of my poor families,    is all this the day? the century's beginning, the golden door?     Well, enough said, I, at least, discreet,    as in office, patched and pensive,    I proclaim the redundancy of the inaugural:    I've arrived here with all my baggage,    bad luck and worse jobs,    misery always waiting with open arms,    the mobilization of people piled up on top of each other,    and the manifold geography of hunger.

How do they survive, riven   as they are, the one undoing   the other's desire?    Tell the body to outrun   the mind, and the mind smirks,   whispering too loudly this way   this way,   blocking all the exits.    And the body, luxurious   sensualist by pool side or in bed,   doesn't it hear the mind's   impatient machinery ticking it's time   it's time?  And only in our mind's eye,   as we're fond of saying,   someone else's body leaping nimbly   in jetés of thought, or revealing   to us Act V, scene iii   in one gestural flourish,   body and mind beautifully   synchronous.    Oh, the mind is eely, slipping   out of its puzzle boxes,   loving its own wit.    And the earnest body: speak of it   with the least irony, and already   you've begun to unnerve it.    Better to let them have their way,   forgetting about them both   until they meet again sometime   as if for the first time   in library or steam room   ready to shake hello  or lead you to whatever door there is   and always the two sets of stairs.

His last composed poem, "Over My Head," 
  closes with the evening tide coming in as the light fails over Brighton Beach. 
In the years of The Great Plague, 
  he lived with his mother and brother and wrote the Elegies that remain unpublished, 
under the eaves in an unfinished room above 
  his mother's late-night television vigil. He wrote to a ghostly laugh-track 
in the night. Though he cut out and saved 
  lurid, five-color magazine pictures of The South Pacific, The Aegean; though 
he hoped for a winter crossing by steamer 
  until his final weakness set in, underneath he was a city boy 
whose poems drifted like a dinghy 
  in small inlets—Gravesend, Rockaway— out too far for safety, in sight of land.

Where does such sadness in wood come
from? How could longing live in these
wires? The box looks like the most fragile
coffin tuned for sound. And laid
across the knees of this woman
it looks less like a baby nursed
than some symbolic Pietà,
and the stretched body on her lap
yields modalities of lament
and blood, yields sacrifice and sliding
chants of grief that dance and dance toward
a new measure, a new threshold,
a new instant and new year which
we always celebrate by
remembering the old and by
recalling the lost and honoring
those no longer here to strike these
strings like secrets of the most
satisfying harmonies, as
voices join in sadness and joy
and tell again what we already
know, have always known but forget,
from way back in the farthest cove,
from highest on the peaks of love.

O! wonderful for weight and whiteness! 
    Ideolog whose absolutes 
         Are always proven right 
              By white and then 
         More white and white again, 
    Winning the same argument year After year by making the opposition 
                  Disappear! 
O! dear miniature of infinity with no 
    End in sight and no snow- 
        Flake exactly like 
              Another, all 
        A little different no 
    Matter how many may fall, Just like our own DNA or the human face 
                   Eternal! 
O! still keep covering the street 
    And sidewalks, cemeteries, even 
         Our twice-shoveled drive, 
              And all that is alive, 
         With geometries that sleet 
    Will freeze into Death's Impromptu vision of a heaven 
                   Wholly white! 
For we know who your sponsor is, whose will 
    You so immensely serve, 
         Whose chill is more severe 
              Than any here. 
         Though his name may be unspoken, 
    His commandments are unbroken, And every monument that you erect 
                   Belongs to him!

This afternoon the park is filled with brides. Among varieties of persuasion the big trees turn back toward the forest. Adventurers gather in side streets. The police are looking hard at the sky. Down at the bay, boys trapped in solitude fish. Girls hike their pants and stare at the wave line, remembering secrets they once held dear. The day offers a ridiculous variation as an excuse for not coming in on time. Wild imaginings take the place of religion. Someone who can't swim offers to cook. We've devised a means for the obstinate children to be fed, she says, but no one understands this. We crave affection, but give only advice. There are walls topped with broken bicycles. Someone makes an obscene offer and this is the best we get all day. Oh don't give in so easily she says, handing over the keys. We climb the blue fire escape. We would like to keep going, skyline climbers, old men remembering their childhood who devise a few illegal experiences no one wants to try. It gets to be more than the officers can take. The park is dusty, dark, yet the children, ignored all day, play on, convinced their dedication releases a magic that changes everything.

Years later, the water still drips— there's no one to tighten the valve. It courses through old pipes down to the septic tank.  Next morning in the cellar I start the motor with a stick.  It shakes and rumbles, and chirps— the switch is broken is all.   At night the water arrives illegally, undergroundly, to the very grave where last spring parsley sprouted,  and at the foot, beside it, feral sorrel darkens tastily and tartly like clandestine sex.  The motor lifts the spirits and returns the night's deductions. It's morning, I hum softly— a stranger will replace me.   In the cellar a stream of light  rinses the window grate, it pulses, strikes the meter— I catch my rhythm on the stairs.  And for memory's sake I hum— as I pass the septic tank— a fluid, underground song about sorrel and a stranger.

You could grow into it,  that sense of living like a dog,  loyal to being on your own in the fur of your skin,  able to exist only for the sake of existing.   Nothing inside your head lasting long enough for you to hold onto,  you watch your own thoughts leap across your own synapses and disappear— small boats in a wind,         fliers in all that blue,                 the swish of an arm backed with feathers,  a dress talking in a corner,                 and then poof,         your mind clean as a dog’s,  your body big as the world,         important with accident—                blood or a limp, fur and paws.   You swell into survival,         you take up the whole day,  you’re all there is,         everything else is  not you, is every passing glint, is         shadows brought to you by wind,                 passing into a bird’s cheep, replaced by a                                rabbit skittering across a yard,  a void you yourself fall into.   You could make this beautiful,         but you don’t need to,  living is this fleshy side of the bone,         going on is this medicinal smell of the sun—                no dog ever tires of seeing his life    keep showing up at the back door  even as a rotting bone with a bad smell;  feet tottering, he dreams of it,  wakes and licks no matter what.

I   "One Snodgrass, two Snodgrass, three Snodgrass, four . . .        I took my own rollcall when I counted seconds;  "One two three, Two two three, Three . . .," the drum score         Showed only long rests to the tympani's entrance.   "Oh-oh-oh leff; leff; leff-toh-righ-toh-leff,"         The sergeant cadenced us footsore recruits;  The heart, poor drummer, gone lame, deaf,         Then AWOL, gets frogmarched to the noose.   II   Old coots, at the Veterans', might catch breath         If their cheeks got slapped by a nurse's aide,  Then come back to life; just so, at their birth,         Young rumps had been tendered warm accolades.   The kick-ass rude attitude, smart-assed insult,         The acid-fueled book review just might shock  Us back to the brawl like smelling salts,         Might sting the lulled heart up off its blocks.   III   I thought I'd always favor rubato         Or syncopation, scorning fixed rhythms;                 Thought my old heartthrobs could stand up to stress;  Believed one's bloodpump should skip a few beats         If it fell into company with sleek young women;                 Believed my own bruit could beat with the best.   Wrong again, Snodgrass! This new gold gadget,         Snug as the watch on my wife's warm wrist,                 Drives my pulsetempo near twice its old pace—  Go, nonstop startwatch! Go, clockwork rabbit,         Keeping this lame old dog synchronized,                 Steady, sparked up, still in the race.

Hatcher was the younger of the two, and he said to Johnson, "What do you think he was painting?" Johnson looked bemused and said, "The dark, stupid. What else could he have been painting?" Hatcher, a little hurt, said, "Frogs in the Dark, Lily- pads in the Dark, Pond in the Dark. Just as many things exist in the dark as they do inthe light." Johnson paused, exasperated. Then Hatcher added, "I'd like to see them. Hell, I might even buy one. Maybe there's more out there than we know. We are the police, after- all. We need to know."

For Hayden Carruth



Thought thrusts up, homely as a hyacinth   
wrapped in its bulb like a root-vegetable,   
a ninth-month   
belly, where the green indelible   
pattern's inscribed into the labyrinth.   
Thrust into light, it's air's inhabitant   
with light and air as food and drink.   
A hyacinth, tumescent pink   
on the low wooden Mexican chest   
confronts the wintry dusk   
with informed self-interest.   
Leaf-spears extravagantly ask   
what idea, still gnarled up in a knot   
of ganglions, will break through the husk   
shaped at last, recognizable as thought.     
• 
   
Trace, on a city map, trajectories   
of partially-forgotten words   
along the river's arteries,   
volatile substance of a sentient world.   
Mauve heather crowds the window-grill. The light   
lingers a little later, with a slight   
vernal inflection. In a moon-glazed vase   
bloom yellow freesias, like some rainy day's   
brook-bank, in someone else's memory.   
Small whirlpools of perception widen, ring   
an infant's numinous discoveries   
of syllables for animals, toys, trees:   
a Lab's thick coat, the dusty birds   
in Claremont Park each tardy urban spring,   
a stuffed pink leather horse with button eyes.     
• 
   
A question-mark in yellow overalls,   
I could read. I was three.   
I slept with that pink horse. My one doll's   
name was V. J. She'd been given to me   
to celebrate the Victory   
over Japan, that is to say, the Bomb   
I'd spend my schooldays taking shelter from.   
I couldn't tie my shoes. But Reddy the fox,   
Tootle the engine who jumped off the tracks,   
spelled me their stories on my mother's lap   
despite weak eyes and poor small-motor skills.   
My grandparents were dead: not in pogroms,   
not in the camps—of strokes and heart attacks,   
merely immigrants, not deportees.   
"When you die, does everything just stop?"     
• 
   
I'm four, in itchy woolen leggings,   
the day that I can't recognize the man   
down at the park entrance, waving,   
as my father. He has ten   
more years to live, that spring. Dapper and balding   
he walks toward me; then I run toward him, calling   
him, flustered by my flawed vision.   
Underfoot, the maples' green-   
winged seeds splay on mica-specked octagons.   
His round face, thin nose, moustache silvered gray   
at thirty-eight look (I think now) Hungarian.   
I like his wood-smell of two packs a day   
as he swings me up to his shoulder   
and I say, things look blurry far away   
—one Saturday, two years after the war.

Nico Vassilakis uses various processes to bring us to his visual poems. In “phabetical” he uses a toy microscope with a built-in video camera to capture highly magnified images of text, often with his hand moving the microscope across the page to capture still text in motion. As he has done here, Vassilakis sometimes modifies the settings on the camera so that the texts are captured in unnatural colors, and he sometimes reverses the polarity of these to further alter their materiality. In this poem, he has used a software process to band many slips of texts into columns and rows, and he has captured these blocks of text in motion so that we can see all of the middle column but only half of the two columns to either side of it. The result uses Greek letters (an homage to his ancestry) so abstracted that they appear before us almost as concrete images: birds, an arm reaching out, a child kicking a ball. He forces us to see not the common symbols of our alphabet but instead the “phabet”: the pictographs from which all alphabets arose.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry > >

Soon the glass angel must be Wrapped and packed and put away, And this hard year swept out Like tinsel from the Christmas tree— The end of December, aromatic In its homely smoke, and the thin limbs Of maple and ash, the pipecleaner pines, Brushing themselves against The cold carbons of evening. 
I've watched the ice turn Little knifeblades in the grass. Sly beneath them, the mole Knows what to do with dirt— Shoulder it aside, crumb by claw, And build a city deep, A labyrinth of dark Under the stone and the root. I think I could live there. 
I think I could make A music of my own. Thinking Makes a music of its own. You can hear it when Some stray phrase stumbles down The rabbit hole, a few words That broke from the brain And won't go back, always One step ahead of the real. 
But what's in the way To the way in? God, That desperate explanation, Mentor and tormentor, giving us The duties of paradise, 
Obligations of the saved? And is my way in This abyss of the belly, where they Tied the first knot in my life? Even the virgin must have felt The postpartum blues, crazy enough To pin sweet curls in her hair, Shavings she picked up from The floor of the carpenter's shop. I think I can still hear The baby wailing. Or is that cry The dead beating on their graves For the earth to open—
And to let them out, or to let us in?

This sweater is made from only the finest, softest underhairs of the Mongolian camel.



“Fancy-schmancy,” my father would have said,   
whose snazziest sweater was still a declassé   
synthetic from the sweatshops of Taiwan. My friend   
Deloris, however, who really owns such clothes,   
would say “exquisite” or “sublime”—her opened closet’s   
row of shoulders teases late-day bedroomlight   
along such textures, there are days when the laboring brain   
and throbbing crotch appear to us to be not much more   
than her wardrobe’s tasteful accessories. “. . . woven   
from genital-down of prepubescent yeti, and then   
hand-sewn in our undersea domes.” “Untouched   
by anyone other than albino elves, this wool is . . . .” 
______________   Rarefied—to Helthi Hart, the diet guru, it’s   
a cup of clear organic cauliflower broth. And for   
the Emperor Excessia, it’s a mad dessert of swans’ tongues   
—there were, what? ten thousand?—dipped in a slip   
of stiffening honey and set out to await the banqueteers   
like a field of fresh shoots they could graze.   
Some Roman party hosts had great roped bowls of snow   
brought from the mountaintops to entertain their guests   
with dishes of rose-petal sherbet and chilled roe.   
They might even allow the household slaves to slide   
leftover snow along the burning welts the ropes ate   
into their shoulders all down the mountainside.    
______________
   
Afterwards it was an unrecognizable tatter.   
But an image of my father’s worn-thin Bargain City   
“all-weather” jacket is still whole in its polyester glory.   
This is what happened: the alley dog (he later called the thing   
a “cur”) had cornered Livia, and she screamed once,   
with a seven-year-old’s unselfconscious terror.   
And then my father was there, with his jacket wound around his arm,   
and a rock. When it was over, he tore the sleeves off, tied the poor dog   
quiet and, after comforting Livia, they both kneeled down   
to comfort the dog. He was like that. And the jacket   
that served as weapon and restraint?—was like him,   
every day of his life. It did what was needed.    
______________  
I misread “migraine.” Which of the two   
would we call the most rarefied? “Margarine”?   
Or maybe comparison isn’t the point. A ghost   
is a person rarefied through the fine, fine colander    death; that doesn’t make, for most of us, extinction   
an ideal. It was hard to think of Frank and Deloris   
divorcing, since it was hard to imagine the two of them   
engaging in anything so mundane as sex or rage or envy   
with the rest of the hoi polloi. They seemed unearthly   
in close to a literal way, like radio waves. And yet divorce
they did. They found something real they could unjoin,   
hertz from hertz until there just was air.    
______________ 
A dream: We own the softest of the soft   
Mongolian camel underhair sweaters. One day   
(we think we’re doing the “right thing”) we release it   
into the wild, to romp with its brother and sister   
desert sweaters, out where it “belongs.”
You know, however, what happens by now: it’s unfit   
to fend for itself amid that hardened herd.   
They beat it. It’s hungry. It crawls back   
into the city, mewing, curling up at night against a door   
my father opens and, seeing something in need, brings it inside,   
wraps it in flannel. That’s how he was.   
He’d give you the cheap shirt off his back.

When fall brought the graders to Atlas Road, I drove through gray dust thick as a battle and saw the ditch freshly scattered with  gravel. 
Leveling, shaving on the bevel, the blade and fanged scraper had summoned sleepers— limestone loaves and blue slate, skulls of quartz 
not even early freeze had roused. Some rocks were large as buckets, others just a scone tumbled up and into light the first time 
in ages. Loose, sharp, they were a hazard to anyone passing. So I gathered what I could, scooped them into the bed 
and trucked my freight away under birdsong in my own life's autumn. I was eager to add to the snaggled wall bordering 
my single acre, to be safe, to be still and watch the planet's purposeful turning behind a cairn of roughly balanced stones. 
Uprooted, scarred, weather-gray of bones, I love their old smell, the familiar unknown. To be sure this time I know where I belong 
I have brought, at last, the vagrant road home.

I passed by the school where I studied as a boy
and said in my heart: here I learned certain things
and didn't learn others. All my life I have loved in vain
the things I didn't learn. I am filled with knowledge,
I know all about the flowering of the tree of knowledge,
the shape of its leaves, the function of its root system, its pests and parasites.
I'm an expert on the botany of good and evil,
I'm still studying it, I'll go on studying till the day I die.
I stood near the school building and looked in. This is the room
where we sat and learned. The windows of a classroom always open
to the future, but in our innocence we thought it was only landscape
we were seeing from the window.
The schoolyard was narrow, paved with large stones.
I remember the brief tumult of the two of us
near the rickety steps, the tumult
that was the beginning of a first great love.
Now it outlives us, as if in a museum,
like everything else in Jerusalem.

All day they stream past, petitioners
for understanding, accolade, critique.
I read them all, a vast anthology
of jumbled genres on a common theme:
affliction. So I parse, interpret, scan.
I graph dysrhythmias, dysmetrias;
I eavesdrop on caesuras for unsaid
murmurs, gallops, rubs, snaps, flutters, clicks.
The perils of misreading harrow me—
beware the treacheries of metaphor!—
the elephant that squats upon a chest
is not a burning heart or waterbrash. 
Just take the imagists. Their heads explode.
St Elmo's fire flashdances on their limbs.
They float, they swim. Knives twist within their flesh.
They're ball-and-chained by lead, filled with concrete.
Butterflies inhabit them. Their pipes
are wrong, and clogged. Their systems freeze and crash.
Invaded, they resist; defenses fail.
What they need, they think, is you to flush
it out of them, whatever it is, doc. 
The formalists present minutiae,
in alphabetical enjambed iambs—
pentameter's ten digits, five lub-dubs—
from acne, backpain, catarrh, dandruff, eye-
strain, flatfoot, gas pains, hangnail, itchiness,
the jitters, kinks, lethargies, migraines, nose-
bleeds, obstipation, panics, queasy retch-
ings, styes and tremors, ulcers, vertigo,
to wandering womb, xerosis, yaws and zits. 
Free versers, on the other hand, wax Walt
Whitmanic: their barbaric yawps celebrate and sing
incantatory songs of themselves, songs
of the breath as it wheezes and rales through them,
the short breath and long breath, the breath that is moist or dry,
songs of the blood, the thick- and thinness of it, its heat, its turbulence,
songs of the gut, its rippling coils, the dark burden of its secret indulgences,
songs of the muscled limb, inflamed with toil or the languid thrash of love. 
Didacticists, of course, will always add
their theories of omission or commission:
slept in a draft, got their feet wet, caught a chill,
forgot their overshoes and oversoul,
ate too little roughage, too much ham,
should have pumped less iron or pumped more, Mea culpa, meus morbus they intone,
certain you'll absolve them back to health. 
Narrativists enshrine a fleeting pain
within an epic of chronology I woke at six—I'm a morning person— brushed my teeth, ate oatmeal with a pat of low-fat margarine, the kind that has the dancing turkey on the tub, on sale for .99 at Johnnie's, by the time
you tune back in it's afternoon, the pain
has come and gone; they're vacuuming the rug,
the doorbell rings, the kettle's whistling,
you try to interrupt—where did you say that pain was?—loquacity steamrolls on
through supper, TV, bedtime, dreams, alarm
clock going off at six. Try Tylenol,
you say, your fingers crossed. Call if it's worse. 
Then there's the avant garde. The cutting edge.
The text Munchausens off the sizzling page.
Hypoglossalalia muscles in,
between John Cagey silences, the din
and Sturm of wild unsound, unsense.
O, there are stranger dysphasias, Wernicke,

mutant L=A=N=G=U=A=G=Es that cacophone

fibrillate with longing—El Dorado,

You say, "I understand." You really don't.

Jerboa on a triple: I was in for it,   
my zither on a double looking feeble    
as a "promising" first book. Oedipal & reckless,   
my scheme would fail: keep him a couple drinks    
ahead, & perhaps the muse would smile   
upon me with some ses or some blanks.    
January, Vermont: snowflakes teased the windows   
of the Burlington airport bar. The waitress    
tallied tips & channel-surfed above the amber   
stutter of the snowplow's light: it couldn't    
keep up, either. Visibility to zero, nothing taking off   
& his dulcimer before me (50 bonus points    
for "bingos") like a cautionary tale. The night   
before I'd been his warm up act,    
the audience of expensive preppies   
doubling to twenty when he shambled    
to the podium to give them Martial   
& his then-new poems. "Why do you write    
something nobody reads anymore?" queried one   
little trust fund in a blazer. "Because    
I'm willing to be honestly confused   
& honestly fearful." Il miglior fabbro,    
a.k.a. Prez: sweet & fitting honorifics he has left   
upon the living's lips. Sweet & fitting too    
that I could know the poems much better than   
the man, flawed as I am told he was. Connoisseur    
of word-root & amphibrach, of Coltrane   
solo & of California reds, of box score & Horatian loss,    
his garrulousness formidable & masking   
a shyness I could never penetrate, meeting him    
would always find me tongue-tied,   
minding my ps & qs, the latter of which    
I could not play, failing three times to draw a u.   
The dead care nothing for our eulogies:    
he wrote this many times & well.   
& yet I pray his rumpled daimonion 
shall guide our letters forward   
as they wend the snow-white notebook leaves,    
the stanzas scrolling down the laptop screens.   
Game after game & the snow labored on.     Phalanx, bourboned whiteout & the board aglow   
as he'd best me again & again. Qintar 
& prosody, the runway lights enshrouded   
& the wind, endquote, shook the panes.

Camille Corot's painting, stolen from the Louvre, May 1998



It might have always been meant  that they walked completely away,  this man on horse, woman with basket.  With their backs to us and the painter,  they are so private. But like those stories  where children step right into a picture  and, looking over their shoulders,  see the consoling frame,  these two would know the way home  like the palms of their hands, the routine  so ordinary it most encloses,  no need for thought, only motion  and the full sensation of sun  on your flesh, along the usual road.

Plum black & the blush white of an apple
shoulder, melon & cream, in tones to list
the flesh; in light, washed colors off at last
& textures sheer with damp I slowly pull
from you with your quick help. Weekend's ample
procrastinations to forget the least
of what we want to do. April, half a blast
of cold, half new light, green & simple.
Now dusk. Now fear. We pencil what we owe
on this short form, our numbers good enough.
The goose-neck glare undoes how we spent the day.
Each bite each bee-sting kiss each bitten O
all aftertaste. Later, at the drop-off,
postmark queue, we joke: "Now we can die!"

I wait for my shadow to forget me, to take that one phantom step that I keep from taking. I wait for the simple flash of a dancer's spat upon this one moon of stage-light, the mind's lonely oval illuminated on the surface of some windless pond or slew. And the old soft-shoe practices to get it right, husha-husha-hush in its constant audition of sawdust. Even this choreography of useless wishing is not enough to keep tonight from becoming nothing more than some floor's forgotten routine where faded, numbered dance-steps silently waltz themselves away. The orchestra's now ready to Fauréinto the evening's last song while I try to convince myself to cross this room for the first time all night and rinse what's left in some débutante's silver sequined waterfall, hope keeling hopelessly ever closer to the edge. Across the floor other couples sashay on. A tin flask empties itself from asking, the shadow's last chance now wasted in some chandelier's dim lust.

Doors opened and shut,  the director shouted orders  through a bullhorn,  or babbled just                                out of the frame.  A carpenter hammered flats nearby  for the next production.  All of this, and more,  while the actors blocked it out,  already living  in that small square of light  where silence reigned  like a tiny theatre for the deaf.   Now, almost a century later,  it's peaceful, far  from the center of action,  the last voice on the street  reduced to a whisper,                                then gone.  Not even birdsong  as evening's opening credits  begin to roll.   Only the film,  shimmering out of a disc  thinner than sound,  characters moving  like fish in their gray element—  less than fish—  not a hiss, not a bubble,  not even a cry  from that dim world of silence  doubled by time.

Standing in line at the SuperSave, it all falls  Into place, Princess Di and the aliens and diet  Tips from outer space, King Tut and King Elvis,     Out of the subfusc air, the rank urgency of dusk,     Among the heavy odors of differing dungs,     Acrid signatures of urine, the bold perfume of musk . . . Nostradamus, this year's senate race, unforeseen  Links between absolutely everything and sex,  Conspiracies requiring conspiracy to be detected,     From a sibilance of scattered leaves, the sudden     Snap of twig, inflections of a gabbling breeze,     Horizons stained with dust, the attitude of trees . . . And O my fellow shoppers waiting to check out,  What appetite is this that drives such dim belief,  What thirst for intercourse between these banal bits?     From the cacophony of birds as from abrupt silence,     Odd sounds of usual insects, subliminal presence     Of added shadow, faintest trembling in the ground . . .  When greed and accident stand ever ready to explain,  Whence this convolvulus of tenuous connection?  What need for the devious when the obvious will do?     From remarkable weeds, from a slight imbalance     In the normal proportion of game, from distressed bark,     Out of the bewildering swirl of importunate sense . . .  Attention, shoppers, there lies a veldt within us each,  Its grasses rustle with intent, and on that plain  Was born the fine suspicion that has carried us so far,     To behold the unassuming fact and comprehend design,     To look upon confusion and construct its plot and act,   To leap at merest notion found floating in the mind . . .  Has brought us to these sheltered aisles under thin gray light,  Where in boredom and abundance we seek our narrative, Whatever tale comes now to kill us and can creep.

Talking, we begin to find the way into
our hearts, we who knew no words,
words being a rare commodity
in those countries we left behind. 
Both refugees and similarly deprived,
we marvel at the many things there
are to say: so many variations
and colors of the same thought, so 
many different lengths in the words
that line up together on our tongues.
No scarcity, no rationing, no
waiting in line in order to buy 
the same answer we heard each time
we asked, that one word, owned by
the state, manufactured by the state,
serving all purposes equally alike:
No, No, No, and sometimes Never.

The afternoon slows down, the town in steady rain.  That one with the trendy chicken-plucked look—  hair a tufted circle on top, the rest shaved all around—  I can't really care about. Of course I hope  he grows up without totalling himself and his car,  but he's the clown in this act. He seems even  to know his place as unworthy twerpy follower  of the one no one would look away from for long,  whose James Dean stance, hands deep in pockets  of a rattily natty maroon corduroy blazer,  shoves his shoulders nearly to his ears.  Beneath the blazer, long sulked-in jeans,  oversized black boots. He lifts one  to kick a milkshake someone couldn't finish  standing on the sidewalk, and it lands on  its side, explodes and rolls a vanilla graffito,  expletive unfurling. Expressionless himself.  The other boy smirks before the rain douses  and sweeps it stupidly into the gutter.  
Even if I were not invisible through this darkish window,  they would know how to erase me. Well,  he  would.  I would enjoy that, just to see how he would do it,  what sort of panache he'd pack in his shrug.  
Raining harder, and the tuft-headed one shifts  unhappily under the Revco awning, pivoting  his whole body now and then to see what the one  I'm half in love with's doing, fifteen, maybe sixteen:  he's twitching in sublime irritation, lighting up  again, hard to do with both hands in your pockets  but he pretty much manages no problem, and now  comes the move that gets me. He strides out  from under the awning, a spotted Lucky sticking straight  from his lip, walks two buildings down and turns  at the corner so his back's to Main Street and me,  stands, his twitch becalmed at last, stands  without heeding his friend's pleading  jeering calls, you idiot,  you idiot, you idiot, stands hunched, not looking up or down,  and I can tell this is his moment, this is where  he'll break off, he's going to unload everyone,  he doesn't blink as he hawks up their nothingness  and spits, feeling himself filling with what's left:  he takes possession of his spirited bad luck for good  and mounts and rides it without moving a muscle, stands  letting the rain collect behind his collar and drench  his gloriously inappropriately maroon corduroy  and his hair that looks not combable by anyone  alive, wild and bunched even when the rain  has patted keeps patting at it harder and harder  like an obsolete humiliated hand that wants to  feed and fend for and in general do for him,  and he has turned his back at last on the clown,  and on Main Street full of clowns you can both see  and not see, who wouldn't dare try to keep an eye on him  or try to follow him from now on.

I knew that James Whistler was part of the Paris scene,
but I was still surprised when I found the painting
of his mother at the Musée d'Orsay
among all the colored dots and mobile brushstrokes
of the French Impressionists. 
And I was surprised to notice
after a few minutes of benign staring,
how that woman, stark in profile
and fixed forever in her chair,
began to resemble my own ancient mother
who was now fixed forever in the stars, the air, the earth. 
You can understand why he titled the painting
"Arrangement in Gray and Black"
instead of what everyone naturally calls it,
but afterward, as I walked along the river bank,
I imagined how it might have broken
the woman's heart to be demoted from mother
to a mere composition, a study in colorlessness. 
As the summer couples leaned into each other
along the quay and the wide, low-slung boats
full of spectators slid up and down the Seine
between the carved stone bridges
and their watery reflections,
I thought: how ridiculous, how off-base. 
It would be like Botticelli calling "The Birth of Venus"
"Composition in Blue, Ochre, Green, and Pink,"
or the other way around
like Rothko titling one of his sandwiches of color
"Fishing Boats Leaving Falmouth Harbor at Dawn." 
Or, as I scanned the menu at the cafe
where I now had come to rest,
it would be like painting something laughable,
like a chef turning on a spit
over a blazing fire in front of an audience of ducks
and calling it "Study in Orange and White." 
But by that time, a waiter had appeared
with my glass of Pernod and a clear pitcher of water,
and I sat there thinking of nothing
but the women and men passing by—
mothers and sons walking their small fragile dogs—
and about myself,
a kind of composition in blue and khaki,
and, now that I had poured
some water into the glass, milky-green.

Certainly are niceto want to give me that dog.I raise peacocks—
you can't keep dogsand them on the same place.People come here
have to leave the dog in the car else the peachickens take to the trees
with nervous prostrations.I have twenty-seven. Placesounds like a jungle
at night. They yelland scream at the leastatmospheric disturbance
or mechanical noise.Sitting on the back steps, I spenddays studying how
they could decoratethe lawn to advantage. They preferto sit on the tractors,
the top of the chickenhouse or garbage can lid. I adjustto their taste, which
is anti-dog. Thanksbut I'll take the thought forthe dog. Appreciate
you wanting to give it.Come visit. Nothing to do herebut sit, walk,
collect red bug bites,show you a peacock beforehis tail gets ratty.

In prison, immured in the black pit where the Pope
once fed Benedetto da Foiano less and less each day
until God’s will, not the Pope’s own hand, killed him, —
 
where outside my door each day the castellan
repeated that darkness will teach me I am
a counterfeit bat, and he a real one, —
 
blackness, silence so unremitted
I knew I had survived another day only by the malignant
welcome singsong of his triumphant voice, —
  Benvenuto is a counterfeit bat, and I a real one, —
 
where God had not found me worthy of seeing the sun
even in a dream, I asked the God of Nature
what unexpiated act the suffocation of my senses, such
 
suffering, served to expiate.
 
(This was my first prison.)
 
                   •
 
For the two murders I had committed, — their just,
free but necessary cause
 
revenge, however imperfect the justice —
 
two successive Popes recognized the necessity
and pardoned me. Absolved me.
 
Because my fame as a maker in gold and silver
 
preceded me, though I was hardly more
than an apprentice, when Pope Clement came into
 
possession of the second largest diamond in the world
 
he summoned me from Florence to Rome — called me
into his presence to serve him. To crown the resplendent
 
glittering vestment covering his surplice, he wanted
 
a golden clasp big and round as a small
plate, with God the Father in half-relief above the diamond
 
and cherubs, arms raised, below. Hurry, he said,
  finish it quickly, so that I may enjoy its use a little while.
 
Pope Clement, unlike the great I now serve, was
 
an excellent, subtle
connoisseur; he approved my design.
 
Each week he summoned me into the presence
 
two or three times, eager to inspect my progress.
Then Cecchino, my brother, two years younger than I
 
and still beardless, died —
 
was killed, as he tried to avenge the unjust killing of
a comrade by the ruthless guard of the Bargello.
 
Thus was stolen from him the chance to incise
 
his presence into the hard, careless surface of the world.
The fool who killed him
 
in what justice must call self-defense
 
later proved his nature by
boasting of it.
 
His boasting enraged, maddened me. In this
 
great grief the Pope rebuked me: You act as if grief can change death.
 
Sleepless, eatless, by day I worked at the Pope’s
 
absorbing golden button — and by night, hypnotized
as a jealous lover, I watched and followed
 
the fatuous creature who murdered my brother.
 
At last, overcoming my repugnance to an enterprise
not-quite-praiseworthy, I decided
 
to end my torment. My dagger entered the juncture
 
of the nape-bone and the neck
so deep into the bone
 
with all my strength I could not pull it out.
 
I ran to the palace of Duke Alessandro — for those who
pursued me knew me. The Pope’s natural son,
 
later he became Duke of Florence, before his murder
 
by his own cousin Lorenzino, whose too-familiar
intimacies and pretensions to power
 
he not only indulged but openly mocked.
 
Alessandro told me to stay indoors
for eight days. For eight days I stayed indoors, working
 
at the jewel the Pope had set his heart on.
 
For eight days the Pope failed
to summon me. Then his chamberlain, saying that all was
 
well if I minded my work and kept silent, ushered me
 
into the presence. The Pope cast so menacing
a glance toward me I trembled.
 
Examining my work, his countenance cleared,
 
saying that I had accomplished a vast amount
in a short time. Then he said, Now that you are   cured, Benvenuto — change your life.
 
I promised that I would.  Soon after this, I opened
a fine shop, my first; and finished the jewel.

  Here I leapt   Here I leapt   Here I leapt   Here I leapt
the shrilling cricket in the shrilling summer evening
 
sings; as did my father in the sweet years
 
he served the pleasure of the lords of Florence
as a piper, in the Consort of Pipers.
 
Imagine my father, no longer young, married, still
 
childless, an engineer who designs bridges and
battlements for the Duke, but whose
 
first love is music — the flute. He joined
 
the Duke’s Consort of Pipers. Now his nights
often are spent not bending over charts and plans
 
but dazzled at the court of Lorenzo, called The Magnificent —
 
the same Lorenzo who once plucked Michelangelo, still
a boy, from among the horde of the merely-talented
 
bending to copy the masters in the ducal palace.
 
Lorenzo, with his father’s consent, adopted
the boy; fed him at his own table.
 
Imagine, tonight, the brief concert is over —
 
the Consort of Pipers (respectable, honorable
amateurs: small merchants, a banker, a scholar)
 
mingle, slightly awed, with an ambassador, a Cardinal . . .
 
Suddenly Lorenzo is at my father’s ear: He stood not six inches from me.
 
Not six inches from my father’s ear Lorenzo
 
in a low voice as he begins to move through
the crowd followed by his son Piero
 
(as now my father must struggle to follow)
 
tells my father he has painfully and increasingly
remarked that the flute has led my father to neglect
 
his fine engineering talent and therefore my
 
father will understand why Piero and the Duke
must dismiss him from the Consort of Pipers.
 
Lorenzo, entering the private apartments, was gone.
 
In later years, my father repeated to his
children: He stood not six inches from me.
 
It is a lie. It is a lie that the Medici and you and I
 
stand on the same earth. What the sane eye
saw, was a lie: —
 
two things alone cross the illimitable distance
 
between the great and the rest of
us, who serve them: —
 
a knife; and art.

The emblem of Florence is the lion; therefore
lions, caged but restless and living, centuries ago
 
began to announce to the Piazza della Signoria
 
this is the fearsome seat of the free
government of the Republic of Florence.
 
Duke Cosimo, hating the noise and smell, had them
 
moved behind the palace. For years, I had known
the old man who fed and tended the lions, —
 
one day he humbly asked me if I could make a ring
 
unlike all others for his daughter’s wedding.
I said yes, of course; but, as payment for its
 
rarity, I wanted him to drug the strongest lion
 
asleep, so that I could
examine, for my art, his body.
 
He said he knew no art of drugging; such poison
 
could kill the creature; a week later,
in fury he said yes.
 
The animal was numbed but not
 
sleeping; he tried to raise
his great head, as I lay lengthwise against his warm body;
 
the head fell back. My head
 
nestling behind his, each arm, outstretched, slowly
descending along each leg, at last with both hands I
 
pulled back the fur and touched a claw.
 
This creature whose claw waking could kill me, —
. . . I wore its skin.
 
                   •
 
After the Medici were returned from eighteen years’
banishment, placed over us again not by the will
 
of Florentines, but by a Spanish army —
 
my father, though during the republic he regained
his position as piper, ever loyal to the Medici
 
wrote a poem celebrating his party’s victory
 
and prophesying the imminent
advent of a Medici pope. Then Julius II died;
 
Cardinal de’ Medici, against expectation, was elected;
 
the new pope wrote my father that he must
come to Rome and serve him.
 
My father had no will to travel. Then Jacopo
 
Salviati, in power because married to a Medici,
took from my father his place at the Duke’s new court;
 
took from him his profit, his hope, his will.
 
Thus began that slow extinguishment
of hope, the self ’s obsequies for the self
 
at which effacement I felt not only a helpless
 
witness, but
cause, author.
 
He said I was his heart.
  I had asked to be his heart before I knew what I was asking.
 
Against his mania to make me a musician
 
at fifteen I put myself to the goldsmith’s trade;
without money
 
or position, he now could not oppose this.
  Help the boy — for his father is poor
rang in my ears as I began to sell
 
the first trinkets I had made. Later, to escape
 
the plague then raging, he made me
quickly leave Florence; when I returned,
 
he, my sister, her husband and child, were dead.
 
These events, many occurring before my birth, I
see because my father described them
 
often and with outrage.
 
To be a child is to see things and not
know them; then you know them.
 
                   •
 
Despite the malicious
stars, decisive at my birth: despite their
 
sufficient instrument, the hand within me that moves   against me: in the utter darkness of my first prison
God granted me vision:
 
surrounded by my stinks, an Angel, his beauty
 
austere, not wanton, graciously
showed me a room in half-light crowded with the dead:
 
postures blunted as if all promise of change
 
was lost, the dead
walked up and down and back and forth:
 
as if the promise of change
 
fleeing had stolen the light.
Then, on the wall, there was a square of light.
 
Careless of blindness I turned my eyes
 
to the full sun. I did not care
to look on anything again but this. The sun
 
withering and quickening without distinction
 
then bulged out: the boss
expanded: the calm body of the dead Christ
 
formed itself from the same
 
substance as the sun. Still on the cross,
he was the same substance as the sun.

The bait the Duke laid
was Perseus. Perseus
 
standing before the Piazza della Signoria.
 
My statue’s audience and theater, Michelangelo’s David; Donatello’s
  Judith With the Head of Holofernes . . .
 
Here the school of Florence, swaggering, says
to the world: Eat.
 
Only Bandinelli’s odious Hercules and Cacus
 
reminds one that when one walks
streets on earth one steps in shit.
 
Duke Cosimo desired, he said, a statue of Perseus
 
triumphant, after intricate trials able
at last to raise high
 
Medusa’s mutilated head — he imagined,
 
perhaps, decapitation of the fickle
rabble of republican Florence . . .
 
I conceived the hero’s gesture as more generous: —
  Kill the thing that looked upon makes us stone.
 
Soon enough, on my great bronze bust of the great
 
Duke, I placed — staring out from his chest —
Medusa, her head not yet cut, living.
 
                   •
  Remember, Benvenuto, you cannot bring your great gifts to light by your strength alone   You show your greatness only through   the opportunities we give you Hold your tongue     I will drown you in gold
 
                   •
 
As we stared down at the vast square, at David, at Judith — then at Hercules and Cacus
 
approved and placed there by Cosimo himself —
 
from high on the fortress lookout of the palace,
against whose severe façade so many
 
human promises had been so cunningly
 
or indifferently crushed, I told the Duke that I
cannot make his statue. My brief return from France
 
was designed only to provide for the future of
 
my sister and six nieces, now without husband
or father. The King of France alone had saved me
 
from the Pope’s dungeon — not any lord of Italy!
 
At this, the Duke looked at me
sharply, but said nothing.
 
All Rome knew that though I had disproved
 
the theft that was pretext for my arrest, Pope Paul
still kept me imprisoned, out of spite —
 
vengeance of his malignant son Pier Luigi, now
 
assassinated by his own retainers.
One night at dinner, the King’s emissary gave the Pope
 
gossip so delicious that out of merriment, and about to vomit
 
from indulgence, he agreed
to free me. I owed King Francis
 
my art, my service. The same stipend he once paid
 
Leonardo, he now paid me; along with a house in Paris.
This house was, in truth, a castle . . .
 
I omitted, of course, quarrels with the King’s
 
mistress, demon who taunted me for the slowness
of my work, out of her petty hatred of art itself;
 
omitted her insistence to the King that I
 
am insolent and by example teach
insolence to others. Omitted that I overheard the King
 
joke with her lieutenant: —
  Kill him, if you can find me his equal in art.
 
Before the school of Florence I had only been able,
 
young, to show myself as goldsmith
and jeweler; not yet as sculptor.
 
Duke Cosimo then announced that all the King of France
 
had given me, he would surpass: boasting,
he beckoned me to follow him past the public
 
common galleries, into the private apartments . . .
 
Dutiful abashed puppet, I followed; I knew
I would remain and make his statue.
 
                   •
  In the mirror of art, you who are familiar with the rituals of decorum and bloodshed before which you are   silence and submission   while within stone the mind writhes
  contemplate, as if a refrain were wisdom, the glistening   intrication of bronze and will and circumstance in the mirror of art.
 
                   •
 
Bandinelli for months insinuated in the Duke’s ear
Perseus never would be finished: —
 
I lacked the art, he said, to move from the small
 
wax model the Duke rightly praised, to lifesize
bronze whose secrets tormented even Donatello.
 
So eighteen months after work began, Duke Cosimo grew
 
tired, and withdrew his subsidy. Lattanzo Gorini,
spider-handed and gnat-voiced, refusing to hand over
 
payment said, Why do you not finish?
 
Then Bandinelli hissed Sodomite! at
me — after my enumeration, to the court’s
 
amusement, of the sins against art and sense
 
committed by his Hercules and Cacus, recital
designed to kill either him or his authority . . .
 
The Duke, at the ugly word, frowned
 
and turned away. I replied that the sculptor of Hercules and Cacus must be a madman to think that I
 
presumed to understand the art that Jove in heaven
 
used on Ganymede, art nobly practiced here on earth
by so many emperors and kings. My saucy speech
 
ended: My poor wick does not dare to burn so high!
 
Duke and court broke into laughter. Thus was
born my resolve to murder Bandinelli.
 
                   •
 
I’d hurl the creature to hell. In despair at what must
follow — the Duke’s rage, abandonment of my
 
never-to-be-born Perseus — I cast
 
myself away for lost: with a hundred crowns
and a swift horse, I resolved first to bid
 
farewell to my natural son, put to wet-nurse in Fiesole;
 
then to descend to San Domenico, where Bandinelli
returned each evening. Then, after blood, France.
 
Reaching Fiesole, I saw the boy
 
was in good health; his wet-nurse
was my old familiar, old gossip, now
 
married to one of my workmen. The boy
 
clung to me: wonderful in a two-year-old, in
grief he flailed his arms when at last
 
in the thick half-dusk
 
I began to disengage myself. Entering the square
of San Domenico on one side, I saw my prey
 
arriving on the other. Enraged that he still
 
drew breath, when I reached him
I saw he was unarmed. He rode a small sorry
 
mule. A wheezing donkey carried a ten-year-old
 
boy at his side. In my sudden presence, his face
went white. I nodded my head and rode past.
 
                   •
 
I had a vision of Bandinelli surrounded
by the heaped-up works of his hand.
  Not one thing that he had made   did I want to have made.
From somewhere within his body
 
like a thread
 
he spun the piles surrounding him. Then he
tried to pull away, to release the thread; I saw
 
the thread was a leash.
 
He tried and tried to cut it.
At this, in my vision I said out-loud: —
  My art is my revenge.
 
                   •
 
When I returned to Florence from Fiesole, after
three days news was brought to me that my little boy
 
was smothered by his wet-nurse
 
turning over on him as they both slept.
His panic, as I left; his arms raised, in panic.
 
                   •
  from the great unchosen narration you will soon be released   Benvenuto Cellini   dirtied by blood and earth but now
  you have again taught yourself to disappear   moving wax from arm to thigh   you have again taught yourself to disappear   here where each soul is its orbit spinning   sweetly around the center of itself   at the edge of its eye the great design of virtue   here your Medusa and your Perseus are twins   his triumphant body still furious with purpose but his face abstracted absorbed in   contemplation as she is   abstracted absorbed though blood still spurts from her neck
  defeated by a mirror   as in concentration you move wax from thigh to arm   under your hand it grows
 
                   •
 
The idyll began when the Duke reached me a goldsmith’s
hammer, with which I struck the goldsmith’s
 
chisel he held; and so the little statues were
 
disengaged from earth and rust. Bronze
antiquities, newly found near Arezzo, they lacked
 
either head or hands or feet. Impatient for my
 
presence, the Duke insisted that I join him each evening
at his new pastime, playing artisan — leaving orders
 
for my free admittance to his rooms, day or night.
 
His four boys, when the Duke’s eyes were turned,
hovered around me, teasing. One night
 
I begged them to hold their peace.
 
The boldest replied, That we can’t do! I said
what one cannot do is required of no one.
  So have your will! Faced with their sons’
 
delight in this new principle, the Duke and Duchess
smiling accused me of a taste for chaos . . .
 
At last the four figures wrought for the four
 
facets of the pedestal beneath Perseus
were finished. I brought them one evening to the Duke,
 
arranging them on his worktable in a row: —
  figures, postures from scenes that the eye cannot entirely decipher, story haunting the eye with its
  resonance, unseen ground that explains nothing . . .
 
The Duke appeared, then immediately
retreated; reappearing, in his right hand
 
he held a pear slip. This is for your garden, the garden of   your house. I began, Do you mean, but he cut me off
saying, Yes, Benvenuto: garden and house now are yours.
 
Thus I received what earlier was only lent me.
 
I thanked him and his Duchess; then both
took seats before my figures.
 
For two hours talk was of their beauty, —
 
the Duchess insisted they were too exquisite
to be wasted down there
 
in the piazza; I must place them in her apartments.
 
No argument from intention or design
unconvinced her.
 
So I waited till the next day — entering the private
 
chambers at the hour the Duke and Duchess
each afternoon went riding, I carried the statues
 
down and soldered them with lead into their niches.
 
Returning, how angry the Duchess became! The Duke
abandoned his workshop. I went there no more.
 
                   •
 
The old inertia of earth that hates the new
(as from a rim I watched)
 
rose from the ground, legion: —
 
truceless ministers of the great unerasable
ZERO, eager to annihilate lineament and light,
 
waited, pent, against the horizon: —
 
some great force (massive, stubborn, multiform as earth, fury whose single name is LEGION, — )
 
wanted my Perseus not to exist: —
 
and I must
defeat them.
 
Then my trembling assistants woke me.
 
They said all my work
was spoiled.
 
Perseus was spoiled. He lay buried in earth
 
wreathed in fragile earthenware veins from the furnace
above, veins through which he still
 
waited to be filled with burning metal.
 
The metal was curdled. As I slept, sick,
the bronze had been allowed to cake, to curdle.
 
Feverish, made sick by my exertions for
 
days, for months, I slept; while those charged
with evenly feeding the furnace that I had so well
 
prepared, LARKED —
 
I thought, Unwitting ministers of the gorgon Medusa herself. The furnace choked with caking, curdling
 
metal that no art known to man could
 
uncurdle, must be utterly dismantled — all
who made it agreed this must destroy
 
the fragile, thirsty mould of Perseus beneath.
 
But Perseus was not more strong
than Medusa, but more clever: — if he ever
 
was to exist as idea, he must first exist as matter: —
 
all my old inborn
daring returned,
 
furious to reverse
 
the unjust triumphs of the world’s mere
arrangements of power, that seemingly on earth
 
cannot be reversed. First, I surveyed my forces: —
 
seven guilty workmen, timid, sullen,
resentful; a groom; two maids; a cook.
 
I harassed these skeptical troops into battle: —
 
two hands were sent to fetch from the butcher
Capretta a load of young oak, —
 
in bronze furnaces the only woods you use
 
are slow-burning alder, willow, pine: now I needed
oak and its fierce heat. As the oak
 
was fed log by log into the fire, how the cake began
 
to stir, to glow and sparkle. Now
from the increased
 
combustion of the furnace, a conflagration
 
shot up from the roof: two windows
burst into flame: I saw the violent storm
 
filling the sky fan the flames.
 
All the while with pokers and iron rods
we stirred and stirred the channels—
 
the metal, bubbling, refused to flow.
 
I sent for all my pewter plates, dishes, porringers —
the cook and maids brought some two hundred.
 
Piece by piece, I had them thrown
 
into the turgid mass. As I watched the metal for
movement, the cap of the furnace
 
exploded — bronze welling over on all sides.
 
I had the plugs pulled, the mouths of the mould
opened; in perfect liquefaction
 
the veins of Perseus filled . . .
 
Days later, when the bronze had cooled, when the clay
sheath had been with great care removed, I found
 
what was dead brought to life again.
 
                   •
 
Now, my second
prison. It began soon after Perseus was unveiled
 
to acclaim — great acclaim. Perhaps I grew
 
too glorious. Perseus, whose birth consumed
nine years, found stuck to his pedestal
 
sonnets celebrating the master’s hand that made him . . .
 
On the day of unveiling, Duke Cosimo stationed himself
at a window just above the entrance to the palace;
 
there, half-hidden, he listened for hours to the crowd’s
 
wonder. He sent his attendant Sforza to say
my reward
 
soon would astonish me.
 
Ten days passed. At last Sforza appeared and asked
what price I placed on my statue.
 
I was indeed astonished: It is not my custom,
 
I replied, to set a price for my work, as if he were a merchant and I a mere tradesman.
 
Then, at risk of the Duke’s severe displeasure, I was
 
warned I must set a price: infuriated, I said
ten thousand golden crowns.
  Cities and great palaces are built with ten thousand   golden crowns, the Duke
two days later flung at me in anger.
  Many men can build cities and palaces,
 
I replied, but not one can make a second Perseus.
 
Bandinelli, consulted by the Duke, reluctantly
 
concluded that the statue was worth
sixteen thousand.
 
The Duke replied that for two farthings
 
Perseus could go to the scrap heap; that would
resolve our differences.
 
At last, the settlement was thirty-five hundred, one
 
hundred a month. Soon after, charges were brought
against me, for sodomy —
 
I escaped Florence as far as Scarperia, but there
 
the Duke’s soldiers caught me and in chains
brought me back.
 
I confessed. If I had not, I could have been made
 
to serve as a slave in the Duke’s galleys for life.
The Duke listened behind a screen as I was made
 
publicly to confess, in full court . . . Punishment
 
was four years imprisonment. Without the Duke’s
concurrence, of course, no charges could have been
 
lodged, no public humiliation arranged
 
to silence the insolent. The first Cosimo, founder of Medici power, all his life protected Donatello — whose   affections and bliss were found in Ganymede.
 
After imprisonment one month, Cosimo
finally commuted my sentence to house arrest.
 
There his magnanimity allowed me to complete
 
my Christ of the whitest marble
set upon a cross of the blackest.
 
Now, my Christ sits still packed in a crate
 
in the Duke’s new chapel; my bust of the Duke
is exiled to Elba, there to frighten in open air
 
slaves peering out from his passing galleys.
 
Now, after the Duchess and two of their sons
died of fever within two months, Cosimo
 
grows stranger: he murdered Sforza
 
by running him through with a spear: —
he does not own
 
his mind; or will.
 
When I ask release from his service, he says
that he cannot, that he soon
 
will have need of me for great projects; no
 
commissions come. Catherine de’ Medici, regent of
the young French king, petitioned that I be allowed
 
to enter her service. He said I had no will now to work.
 
In prison I wrote my sonnet addressed
to Fortune: — Fortune,  you sow!
  You turned from me because Ganymede   also is my joy . . . O God of Nature, author
of my nature,
 
where does your son Jesus forbid it?
 
When I was five, one night my father
woke me. He pulled me to the basement, making me
 
stare into the oak fire and see what he just had seen.
 
There a little lizard was sporting
at the core of the intensest flames.
 
My father boxed me on the ears, then kissed me —
 
saying that I must remember this night: — My dear little boy, the lizard you see
  is a salamander, a creature that lives   at the heart of fire. You and I are blessed: no other soul now living has been allowed to see it.
 
                   •
 
I am too old to fight to leave Florence: —
 
here, young, this goldsmith and jeweler
began to imagine that
 
severity, that chastity of style
 
certain remnants of the ancient world
left my hand hungry to emulate: —
 
equilibrium of ferocious, contradictory
 
forces: equilibrium whose balance or poise is their
tension, and does not efface them, —
 
as if the surface of each thing
 
arranged within the frame, the surface of each
body the eye must circle
 
gives up to the eye its vibration, its nature.
 
Two or three times, perhaps,— you say where, — I have achieved it.
 
                   •
 
See, in my great bronze bust of the great
Duke, embedded in the right epaulette like a trophy
an open-mouthed
face part lion part man part goat, with an iron
bar jammed in its lower jaw
 
rising resistlessly across its mouth.
 
See, in Vasari’s clumsy portrait of me, as I float
above the right shoulder of the Duke, the same face.”
 
                   •
  As if your hand fumbling to reach inside reached inside   As if light falling on the surface fell on what made the surface   As if there were no scarcity of sun on the sun
 
 
 
                              III
 
I covered my arm with orchid juice.
 
With my hatchet I split a mangrove stick
from a tree, and sharpened it.
 
I covered the killing stick with orchid juice.
 
We were camping at Marunga Island
looking for oysters. This woman I was about to kill
 
at last separated herself from the others
 
to hunt lilies. She walked into the swamp, then
got cold, and lay down on sandy ground.
 
After I hit her between the eyes with my hatchet
 
she kicked, but couldn’t
raise up.
 
With my thumb over the end of the killing stick
 
I jabbed her Mount of Venus until her skin pushed
back up to her navel. Her large intestine
 
protruded as though it were red calico.
 
With my thumb over the end of the killing stick
each time she inhaled
 
I pushed my arm
 
in a little. When she exhaled, I stopped. Little by little
I got my hand
 
inside her. Finally I touched her heart.
 
Once you reach what is
inside it is outside. I pushed the killing stick
 
into her heart.
 
The spirit that belonged to that dead woman
went into my heart then.
 
I felt it go in.
 
I pulled my arm
out. I covered my arm with orchid juice.
 
Next I broke a nest of green ants
 
off a tree, and watched the live ants
bite her skin until her skin moved by itself
 
downward from her navel and covered her bones.
 
Then I took some dry mud and put my sweat
and her blood in the dry mud
 
and warmed it over a fire. Six or eight times
 
I put the blood and sweat and mud
inside her uterus until there was no trace of her
 
wound or what I had done.
 
I was careful none of her pubic hair was left
inside her vagina for her husband to feel.
 
Her large intestine stuck out several feet.
 
When I shook some green ants on it, a little
went in. I shook some more. All of it went in.
 
When I whirled the killing stick with her heart’s blood
 
over her head, her head
moved. When I whirled it some more, she moved
 
more. The third time I whirled the killing stick
 
she gasped for breath. She blew some breath
out of her mouth, and was all right.
 
I said, You go eat some lilies. She
 
got up. I said, You will live two days. One day you will be happy. The next, sick.
 
She ate some lilies. She walked around, then
 
came back and slept. When laughing and talking women
woke her she gathered her lilies and returned to camp.
 
The next day she walked around and played,
 
talked and made fun, gathering with others oysters
and lilies. She brought into camp what she
 
gathered. That night she lay down and died.
 
Even the gods cannot
end death. In this universe anybody can kill anybody
 
with a stick. What the gods gave me
 
is their gift, the power to bury within each
creature the hour it ceases.
 
Everyone knows I have powers but not such power.
 
If they knew I would be so famous
they would kill me.
 
I tell you because your tongue is stone.
 
If the gods ever give you words, one night in
sleep you will wake to find me above you.
 
                   •
 
After sex & metaphysics, —
. . . what?
 
What you have made.
 
                   •
  Infinite the forms, finite tonight as I find again in the mirror the familiar appeaseless   eater’s face   Ignorant of cause or source or end in silence he repeats   Eater, become food   All life exists at the expense of other life Because you have eaten and eat as eat you must   Eater, become food   unlike the burning stars burning merely to be   Then I ask him how to become food   In silence he repeats that others have other fates, but that I must fashion out of the corruptible   body a new body good to eat a thousand years   Then I tell the eater’s face that within me is no sustenance, on my famished   plate centuries have been served me and still I am famished   He smirks, and in silence repeats that all life exists at the expense of other life   You must fashion out of the corruptible body a new body good to eat a thousand years   Because you have eaten and eat as eat you must ignorant of cause or source or end
 
                   •
 
drugged to sleep by repetition of the diurnal
round, the monotonous sorrow of the finite,
 
within       I am awake
 
repairing in dirt the frayed immaculate thread
forced by being to watch the birth of suns
 
                   •
 
This is the end of the third hour of the night.

Cabbages, beans and bell peppers vie for the glossy centerfold of Nature's Hand  where this month the vulgar Hubbard squash reclines with succotash of questionable origin. 
I've grown to prize passivity; I've learned the word "vegetable" comes from Medieval Latin— 
vegetabilis, and vegetare which means "to animate, to grow," though I can think of half a dozen ways to squander 
an afternoon as Destry Rides Again, Dietrich and Stewart...and my doctor friend Lenny who calls to tell me 
that broccoli has a nervous system, that it suffers when you pick it. If form follows function, 
it stands to reason that pain is the fate of all "brainy" things— cauliflower, coral and raspberry clumps, the florets that sizzle 
in my spiced tahini. I've heard potatoes described as "thuggy and plotless," but never "aristocratic" 
as it says on page seven's "The Stately Spud," where tubers possess an enviable pedigree, 
popular back to 4000 b.c. when Incas made urns in the shape of russets— 
long reds, round reds and Yukon Golds, best for sautéing, excellent in frittatas. 
Don't get me wrong. I'm all for ambition, but some days I'd rather steep in my own kettle. 
Give me chamomile, cowboys, cornelian cherries. Let me sink, once again, into purposeless sleep.

For the person who obtained my debit card number and spent $11,000 in five days



My pale stepdaughter, just off the school bus,  Scowled, "Well, that's the last time I say my name's  Snodgrass!" Just so, may that anonymous  Mexican male who prodigally claims   My clan lines, identity and the sixteen  Digits that unlock my bank account,  Think twice. That less than proper name's been  Taken by three ex-wives, each for an amount   Past all you've squandered, each more than pleased  To change it back. That surname you affect  May have more consequence than getting teased  By dumb kids or tracked down by bank detectives.   Don't underrate its history: one of ours played  Piano on his prison's weekly broadcast;  One got rich on a scammed quiz show; one made  A bungle costing the World Series. My own past   Could subject you to guilt by association:  If you write anything more than false checks,  Abandon all hope of large press publication  Or prizes—critics shun the name like sex  Without a condom. Whoever steals my purse  Helps chain me to my writing desk again  For fun and profit. So take thanks with my curse:  May your pen name help send you to your pen.

Port-au-Prince



Girl on a heap of street sweepings high
as a pyre, laid on snarled wire & dented rim.
Girl set down among the wrung-out hides.
A girl who was coming from church. It is late
Sunday afternoon. Was it a seizure? Is it destiny or bad luck we should fear? Weak heart or swerving taxi? In Tet Bef by the dirty ocean
thousands crush past her without pausing
at the shrine of her spayed limbs; brilliance
like the flesh of lilies sprouting from the pummeled cane. Is it possible to be lighthearted, hours later? Days? To forget the yellow dress?
I am waiting for her mother to find her, still
wearing one white spotless glove (where is the other?),
my idle taxi level with her unbruised arm,
her fingers just curling like petals of a fallen flower and how did it end? Let someone have gathered her up
before the stars assembled coldly overhead:
her dress brighter than gold, crocus, the yolk of an egg her face covered like the bride of a god; let them
have found her & borne her though the traffic's clamor
veiled with a stranger's handkerchief.

Birdsongs that sound like the steady determined tapping of a shoemaker's hammer, or of a sculptor making tiny ball-peen dents in a silver plate, wake me this morning. Is it possible the world itself can be happy? The calico cat stretches her long body out across the top of my computer monitor, yawning, its little primitive head a cave of possibility. And I'm ready again to try and see accidents, the over and over patterns of double-slit experiments a billionfold repeated before me. If I had great patience, I could try to count the poplar, birch and oak leaves in their shifting welter outside my bedroom window or the almost infinitesimal trails of thought that flash and flash everywhere, as if decaying particles inside a bubble chamber,windshield raindrops, lake ripples. However, instead I go to fry some bacon, crack two eggs into the cast-iron skillet that's even older than this house, and on the calendar (each month another oriental fan where the climbing solitary is dwarfed . . . or on dark blue oceans minuscular fishing boats bob beneath gigantic waves) X out the days, including those I've forgotten.

  Bob Dahlquist is an artist whose work I first noticed in New York City's Bryant Park, where I saw staring down at me an imaginative logo for a sandwich shop. The logo demonstrated Dahlquist's grasp of what I call the printer's fist—an understanding of the visual and intellectual significance of typographic characters. His "alwaysendeavor" replicates the look of old-fashioned office signs etched into translucent glass doors, but in this case we see the text from both sides at once, and we must pull apart the strands of overlapping text to reconstitute the meaning.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>

Looking at Mapplethorpe’s Polaroids, I learn that he liked shoes and armpit crotch-shots of men and women, both shaved and un’—all giving a good whiff to the camera. But best of all are his pictures of ordinary phones which convey a palpable sense of expectancy as if at any moment, one of the fabulous, laconic nude men strewn about might call. One could pick up the receiver and hear the garbled sound of ancient Greek and Roman voices reveling in the background. But even when silent, the dingy phone is a sex organ—cock asleep in its cradle.

You see them on porches and on lawns down by the lakeside, usually arranged in pairs implying a couple  who might sit there and look out at the water or the big shade trees. The trouble is you never see anyone  sitting in these forlorn chairs though at one time it must have seemed   a good place to stop and do nothing for a while.  Sometimes there is a little table between the chairs where no one   is resting a glass or placing a book facedown.  It might be none of my business, but it might be a good idea one day for everyone who placed those vacant chairs  on a veranda or a dock to sit down in them for the sake of remembering whatever it was they thought deserved  to be viewed from two chairs   side by side with a table in between. The clouds are high and massive that day.  The woman looks up from her book. The man takes a sip of his drink. Then there is nothing but the sound of their looking,  the lapping of lake water, and a call of one bird then another, cries of joy or warning— it passes the time to wonder which.

Mary who mattered to me, gone or asleep among fruits, spilled    in ash, in dust, I did not    leave you. Even now I can't keep from composing you, limbs & blue cloak    & soft hands. I sleep to the sound    of your name, I say there is no Mary   except the word Mary, no trace    on the dust of my pillowslip. I only    dream of your ankles brushed by dark violets, of honeybees above you    murmuring into a crown. Antique queen,    the night dreams on: here are the pears I have washed for you, here the heavy-winged doves,    asleep by the hyacinths. Here I am,    having bathed carefully in the syllables   of your name, in the air and the sea of them, the sharp scent    of their sea foam. What is the matter with me?  Mary, what word, what dust   can I look behind? I carried you a long way    into my mirror, believing you would carry me  back out. Mary, I am still   for you, I am still a numbness for you.

There is no noisier place than the suburbs, someone once said to me as we were walking along a fairway, and every day is delighted to offer fresh evidence:  the chainsaw, the leaf-blower blowing one leaf around an enormous house with columns, on Mondays and Thursdays the garbage truck equipped with air brakes, reverse beeper, and merciless grinder.  There’s dogs, hammers, backhoes or serious earthmovers if today is not your day. How can the birds get a peep or a chirp in edgewise, I would like to know?  But this morning is different, only a soft clicking sound and the low talk of two workmen working on the house next door, laying tile I am guessing.  Otherwise, all quiet for a change, just the clicking of tiles being handled and their talking back and forth in Spanish then one of them asking in English  “What was her name?” and the silence of the other.

The one cashier is dozing— head nodding, slack mouth open, above the cover girl spread out before her on the counter smiling up   with indiscriminate forgiveness and compassion for everyone who isn’t her.    Only the edge   is visible of the tightly spooled   white miles   of what is soon   to be the torn off inch by inch receipts,   and the beam of green light in the black glass of the self scanner   drifts free in the space that is the sum of the cost of all the items that tonight won’t cross its path.  Registers of feeling too precise   too intricate to feel   except in the disintegrating traces of a dream— panopticon of cameras   cutting in timed procession from aisle to aisle to aisle on the overhead screens above the carts asleep inside each other— above the darkened   service desk, the pharmacy, the nursery, so everywhere inside the store is everywhere at once   no matter where— eternal reruns   of stray wisps of steam   that rise   from the brightly frozen, of the canned goods and food stuffs stacked in columns onto columns under columns pushed together into walls of shelves   of aisles all celestially effacing any trace   of bodies that have picked   packed unpacked and placed   them just so   so as to draw bodies to the pyramid of plums,   the ziggurats   of apples and peaches and in the bins the nearly infinite   gradations and degrees of greens   misted and sparkling.  A paradise of absence, the dreamed of freed from the dreamer, bodiless quenchings and consummations   that tomorrow will draw the dreamer the way it draws the night tonight   to press the giant black moth of itself against the windows of fluorescent blazing.

The beautiful plate I cracked in half as I wrapped it in tissue paper— as if the worship of a thing might be the thing that breaks it.  This river, which is life, which is wayfaring. This river,   which is also sky. This dipper, full of mind, which is    not only the hysterical giggling of girls, but the trembling   of the elderly. Not only    the scales, beaks, and teeth of creatures, but also   their imaginative names (elephant, peacock) and their   love of one another, the excited   preparations they sometimes make   for their own deaths.  It is as if some graceful goddess, wandering in the dark, desperate with thirst, bent down and dropped that dipper   clumsily in this river. It floated away. Consciousness, memory, sensory information, the historians and their glorious war . . . The pineal gland, tiny pinecone in the forehead, our third eye:   Of course    it will happen here. No doubt. Someday, here,    in this little house,   they will lay the wounded side by side. The blood will run into the basement through the boards. Their ghosts are already here, along   with the cracked plate wrapped in old paper in the attic,    and the woman who will turn one day at the window to see   a long strange line of vehicles traveling slowly toward her door, which  she opens (what choice does she have?) although she has not yet been born.

When History turns soldiers into battles, you turn them into grass. Bashō, Sweet, is it honorable? But for these men who died with grunts and clangs in their ears, for their horses with snapped legs, I haven’t got the art to make them into anything. I fold the grass in the shape   of a man, very literal, very primitive and leave it on   the field and say, “Forgive me valorous men for my ineptitude.”Just then, the little man falls down in the wind and—huh!—there is art.

Difficult shacks of Kushiro, too far afield, at least theirs are not our roofless griefs even farther in the marshes that are huge buckets of green tea in the rainy season—you glisten as you go, Bashō,   wring out your sleeves. Frog keeps its knees in its armpits on plant flotilla   and Duck of all the birds is shaped most like a canoe. We were not built   for this and anyway, standing smack dab in no-man’s-land you can stop   and say, Here is a place made famous in poems. Aren’t you such a place?

Clamber out of the morning river with water beads like fish eggs clung to your pubis the calluses on your buttocks from sitting, writing on flat rocks, your goose-pimpled thighs—the bumpy tongues of two dogs licking   each other—and river-slather and slather at the edge of my mouth.  You are smiling, straining out your hair, flicking your hands, and then see me watching you with the cloth and pots I was taking to wash. Before I have time to be embarrassed, the smile lifts into your eyes.

Bashō, with your grass pillow, what underground sounds come into your dreams? Do blue-horned beetles scratch against the starless night sky that lines your head with the starless night skies of their own domed backs? Do centipedes trickle through? Do worms burrow with their snouts, with their bodies that are entirely snouts? Snoozer, I can only ask you this because now you are dead asleep: Do I ever appear as a nightcrawler whispering in your ear? Are the words, “I love you,” as soft as the cough of a good luck cricket?

I have a need to ventilate, to have my porous body—sockets   and holes—open to the bald-faced wind and have my heathen   inner-stuff   tweedled like a reed flute and this piffle floats out. But walking on the   open road, I know even open roads, to be roads at all, are ruts.     With a careless beanfield on either side, off one more time, even you,   Mr. Out-in-the-Woods, might as well be stuffed in your hometown bucket.    And if these grim beams of trees are truly home, Sweet, as you say they are,   then the timberwolves would reclaim you by singing and that would be all. The Moon would reclaim the timberwolves—not a snarl—soft keepsakes   asleep in the palm of Her hand. I would reclaim the Moon by picking   a white silk chrysanthemum and resting it on the branch beside Her.    Who would reclaim me? and say, “Blossom, we are not two. There is no road   to or from. You cannot write a love poem. You cannot walk away.”      Each “Appleblossom” is a verse translation from the Japanese of a short selection from the notebooks of Chiri, Bashō’s traveling companion during the years between Withered Chestnuts and Travelogue of Weatherbeaten Bones.

  Peter Ciccariello provides an interesting dilemma to readers of his work. His process usually begins with the writing of a standard lineated poem, but he takes the text of that poem and wraps it around the landforms and ruins of an invented realm that he creates through meticulous computer modeling. The results are stunning and enigmatic textscapes that a reader must sift through carefully to imagine what they originally were and what they originally communicated.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>

“Shalom,” called the pink-shirted man in the Oceanic   Terminal of Heathrow, and I snapped,   “I do not want to talk to you.” Manic  with fear, I extended one pointy-tipped shoe, tapped   the message home. My cases bulged with the wrong   clothes, every outfit trimmed with clipped  English, fit for telephone jobs on Long   Island. Rwanda, Algeria, and me   declaring every kind of independence.  My skirt and I were green, not the pretty   pistachio that Jacqueline Kennedy wore,   but the color copper develops in the sea,  cold and unfortunate, the green of storms   that have never squalled before. My hat,   gloves, and I were pale, not plush like the warm  blonde women settling in their seats   and bubbling dipthongs to their husbands;   not even poignant, like the champagne satin  that Marilyn Monroe was buried in.   Just neutral, stale as a biscuit, off   as an old cup of milk. I was stubborn,  I would do what I said and leave   England. I would ride that El Al jet, mystery   novel in hand and never grieve.  Johnny Carson, The Jetsons, and me.   A new wardrobe in cartoon hues. Meanwhile,   my row-mate slipped off her court shoes, free  toes wiggling in hose. “We all went to Israel,   almost all of us on the flight, and are returning   to South Carolina,” she explained in a drawl  that frightened me more that the turbofan   wailing beneath us. In her sundress, her stomach   looked soft. Ungirdled? Does everyone chat with a twang,  even the Jews? I do not want to talk,   but here I am, midair. “Coffee,” I replied   to the hostess, slowly. I will never wear slacks,    but I can unfasten each word, open it wide.

God’s blood beads on the tarmac and something rough is boiling up just this side of the vanishing point, so it’s probably time to get  off this stretch of blacktop and into the wayside bar, where every cup runneth over and you breast a thickening fret  of stogie smoke to get to the dank back room where a high stakes game turns against you despite your trey of jacks, and soon enough   you’re in way over your head with nothing and no one to blame but the luck you’ve been getting since first you threw your stuff  into a duffel bag and hooked up with the halt and lame, with the grifters and drifters, the die-hards, the masters of bluff,  the very bastards, in fact, who are lifting the last of your stash. . . So it’s into the crapper and out through the window—you’re free  to do whatever you must, so long as that purple-and-yellow blush in the sky doesn’t mean what it seems, so long as that lick of flame  from the hard-shoulder spillage doesn’t travel as far as the scree of garbage in the lay-by, so long as that’s not your name  in the red top front-page splash on the trailer-trash kidnappee. . . Just keep to the shadow-side, keep in under the lee  of roadside billboards, bed down in the roadside scrub, your dream of Ithaca, that ghost town, though the rest is mystery—  what brought you to this and who might take the blame, and how to get from the open road to a sight of the open sea.

Krakatau split with a blinding noise and raised from gutted, steaming rock a pulverized black sky, over water walls that swiftly fell on Java and Sumatra. Fifteen days before, in its cage in Amsterdam, the last known member of Equus quagga, the southernmost subspecies of zebra, died. Most of the wild ones, not wild enough, grazing near the Cape of Good Hope, had been shot and skinned and roasted by white hunters.  When a spider walked on cooling Krakatau's skin, no quagga walked anywhere. While seeds pitched by long winds onto newborn fields burst open and rooted, perhaps some thistle flourished on the quagga's discarded innards. The fractured island greened and hummed again; handsome zebras tossed their heads in zoos, on hired safari plains. Who needs to hear a quagga's voice? Or see the warm hide twitch away a fly,  see the neck turn, curving its cream and chestnut stripes that run down to plain dark haunches and plain white legs? A kind of horse. Less picturesque than a dodo. Still, we mourn what we mourn. Even if, when it sank to its irreplaceable knees, when its unique throat closed behind a sigh, no dust rose to redden a whole year's sunsets, no one unwittingly busy two thousand miles away jumped at the sound, no ashes rained on ships in the merciless sea.

The streaked bowl, the sticky toilet seat, air claustral with stink— all residues and traces of the ancestral   spirit of body free of spirit—hence, behind the station, at the back end of the store, hidden away and dimly lit this cramped and   solitary carnival   inversion—Paul becoming Saul   becoming scents anonymous   and animal; hence,   over the insides   of the lockless stall the cave-like scribblings and glyphs   declaring unto all who come to it in time: “heaven   is here at hand and dark, and hell   is odorless; hell is bright and clean.”

Jerk that bitch, urges my guide,  and I give my shuddering pole a jerk, hooking the throat of the first steelhead of my life. Reel 'em, he mutters and revs the motor. I horse my pole and reel and horse. The boat's mascot whines, her claws clicking. Let it take some line. My father, uncle, and cousin are reeling. First fish! they shout, and I shout, What a fighter! A silver spine touches the air.  There, he points, a hen. And guess what? She's gonna join the club, somehow spotting in that glimpse the smooth place along her back  where a fin had been snipped.  He leans over the gunwale, dips a net, and scoops her into the boat.  She is thick with a wide band  of fiery scales, slap- slapping the aluminum bottom. Welcome to the club, he says, and clobbers her once, and again, and once more before she goes still. A bleeder, he says, shaking his head and handing her to me. I curl a finger through a gill the way you're supposed to, determined not to let her slip and flop back to the river, a blunder I'd never live down. A good fist. Fish, I mean. A good fish.

The second year, I fed all but the eggs  into the machine & said I'll do the latkes & did, my pile of crisp delights borne to the feast by the wife  who baffled me, our books closed, banter hushed,  money useless in the apartment—house, my in-laws called it,  new-wave thump at one end, ganja reek at the other— in which she'd knelt to tell the no one who listened  no more no      no more no     a three-year-old mouthing the essential prayer. The uncle made rich by a song  stacked three & dug in, talking critics & Koch— everyone crunching now, slathering applesauce, slurping tea—  talking Rabin & Mehitabel, radio & Durrell, how a song is a poem or it isn't a song  & vice-versa. Done, he pointed a greasy finger at me, said You can't be a goy. You—I say it  for all to hear—are an honorary Jew!  which, impossible dream, my latkes lived up to  for five more years.

He would have gone to Hell ageine, and earnest sute did make: But Charon would not suffer him to passe the Stygian lake. —Ovid, Metamorphoses (Tr. by Arthur Golding)



Never mind phantom forms, the Keaton-crash that dumped us in that sea-fed swamp, the Dutch kill, Latin nihil, thing without opposite—attend instead the transcendent,  the flying, for god’s sake, what we saw the moment before we thwocked overboard:   a heron stutter-flapped and lifted off, clumsy as a wind-mauled tarp at first,  but couth beyond sublime once clear of cattail punks and saltgrass tips,   the overturned rowboat’s rusted hull.   Or the cormorant that plunked and dipped,    rose flipping fish from beak to tongue   and down its neck, water beading on its head. But the crown that really pleased the crowd my maiden voyage was iridescent green,    brilliantined, a merganser’s spiky coxcomb. He swam right by, chasing red herrings and cackling so happily I had to pull a feather from his cap. And so I surfaced  solo. I tell myself, I only launch the bark,   I never book the seats. I didn’t stop to spin the prop or wipe the rail, just tipped   the motor up and paddle-poled, bottom-  stirred. Rousted horseshoe crabs, sleeping   ducks, cranky grebes, slapped along the little waves, the seeping tide, lonelier, sure, indignant, too—what better lover  has plucked and boasted, over what better lyre? An open boat: it’s company, not coin, I want.   I’ll tune the wake to silence, court grace, make change— still trading on the laughs I’ve jerry-rigged.

  Michael Basinski creates visual poems that are colorful cacophonies of text and shape. His handwritten poems, which often serve as scores for equally exuberant sound poems, are filled to the margin with broken lines of text that curl into one another, read from different directions, and are often filled with nonsense words of his own invention. "Labile" is a good example of a visual poem that defiantly spurns convention. It is a neo-Dadaist poem intent on shaking the reader out of quiet acceptance and somnolence.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>

When the Amish girl gets off the bus she walks over and stomps her small black boot into a drift in front of McDonald's.    She is maybe new to winter  this far north and wants to know  its depth. Its give. Oh,  be careful. It already has you  by the night of your dress,  violet-black with white-dotted print.

The dog came back, grinning and smelling of carrion, and her husband behind it, stride and gestures too large for the house. His field voice, cracking, declared a wider kingdom, and the name of a fallen city, not theirs this time. From outside the roar and shrill of celebration poured in. He drew near in a rank cloud, breathing hard, to show her the gash in his thumb. So she washed in five waters and went to their bed, but he slept without moving, still in his cloak and dust.

  Jesse Patrick Ferguson is a Canadian visual poet working in both visual and textual forms. His "Mama" shows how little text it takes to make a successful visual poem. Consisting of nothing but the letter "e," variously presented, this poem represents the simple warbling cry of a child. The poem is both a touching visualization of an aural event and a strong example of how xerographic transmogrification can add character and meaning to text.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>

  mIEKAL aND often incorporates alien scripts into his work. These can be undecipherable writing systems of history, scripts unfamiliar to most people, and scripts invented by him or others. He uses these to allow us to see written language with new eyes, to appreciate its visual forms, and to face the process of searching for meaning in a foreign textscape. His "mi'kmaq book of the dead" combines seemingly recognizable characters with apparently pictographic ones, encouraging us to pick out a meaning we will never quite find on our own.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>

It’s not the sharks Sliding mere inches from his upturned face Through warps of water where the tunnel arcs Transparent overhead, Their lipless jaws clamped shut, extruding teeth, Their eyes that stare at nothing, like the dead, Staring at him; it’s not the eerie grace Of rays he stood beneath, Gaping at their entranced slow-motion chase  That is unending; It’s not the ultra-auditory hum Of ET cuttlefish superintending The iridescent craft   Of their lit selves, as messages were sent, Turning the sight of him they photographed To code: it is not this that left him dumb With schoolboy wonderment Those hours he wandered the aquarium.  It is that room, That room of Murray River they had walled In glass and, deep within the shifting gloom And subtle drifts of sky That filtered down, it seemed, from the real day Of trees and bird light many fathoms high, The giant Murray cod that was installed In stillness to delay All that would pass. The boy stood there enthralled.  Out in the day Again, he saw the famous streets expound Their theories about speed, the cars obey, Racing to catch the sun, The loud fast-forward crowds, and thought it odd That in the multitudes not everyone Should understand as he did the profound Profession of the cod, That held time, motionless, unknown to sound.  In bed at night, Are his eyes open or is this a dream? The room is all dark water, ghosted light, And midway to the ceiling The great fish with its working fins and gills Suspended, while before it glide the reeling And see-through scenes of day, faintly agleam, Until their passage stills And merges with the deep unmoving stream.

The equilibrium of any particular aspect of nature rests on the equivalence of its opposites. —Piet Mondrian



Some land lives so water can comb
it into grids. Thisis why lowlands 
tilt still towardthe sea. This so 
we call our canalleaning horse, 
hat tempting wind, somewhere a tear  in linen where  the loom bent  a heddle. We plantlapis in the middle
of begonia boxeshung from our 
houseboat’s sills.At night the eels 
snug against our houseboat’s hum, 
water’s warm hem. We hear them slip
itch into our floor.Our houseboat lilts
when the bigger boatsslide us waves. 
Our concrete floats.We’re mostly moored
to stay. In the dampbank where the ducks
hedge weeds,our bikes sleep.
We lean toward wind.Our pant legs thin
from all the rainon our knees.
From here the horizongauzes above us.
We are half hidden by light. We are folds
in fog. We stand open on the deck 
and beckon the silt to settle. We wait 
for a balance so grand that any flicker
of inverse could pull us up to spires.

—how her loose curls float above each silver fish as she leans in to pluck its eyes—  You died just hours ago. Not suddenly, no. You'd been dying so long   nothing looked like itself: from your window,   fishermen swirled sequins;   fishnets entangled the moon.  Now the dark rain   looks like dark rain. Only the wine   shimmers with candlelight. I refill the glasses and we raise a toast to you   as so and so's daughter—elfin, jittery as a sparrow— slides into another lap   to eat another pair of slippery eyes   with her soft fingers, fingers rosier each time,   for being chewed a little.  If only I could go to you, revive you. You must be a little alive still.   I'd like to put this girl in your lap. She's almost feverishly warm and she weighs   hardly anything. I want to show you how   she relishes each eye, to show you her greed for them.    She is placing one on her tongue, bright as a polished coin—    What do they taste like? I ask. Twisting in my lap, she leans back sleepily. They taste like eyes, she says.

We don't see the ocean, not ever, but in July and August when the worst heat seems to rise from the hard clay   of this valley, you could be walking through a fig orchard when suddenly the wind cools and for a moment   you get a whiff of salt, and in that moment you can almost believe something is waiting beyond the Pacheco Pass, something massive, irrational, and so powerful even the mountains that rise east of here have no word for it.  You probably think I'm nuts saying the mountains   have no word for ocean, but if you live here   you begin to believe they know everything.   They maintain that huge silence we think of as divine, a silence that grows in autumn when snow falls slowly between the pines and the wind dies to less than a whisper and you can barely catch your breath because you're thrilled and terrified.  You have to remember this isn't your land.   It belongs to no one, like the sea you once lived beside and thought was yours. Remember the small boats   that bobbed out as the waves rode in, and the men   who carved a living from it only to find themselves   carved down to nothing. Now you say this is home,   so go ahead, worship the mountains as they dissolve in dust,   wait on the wind, catch a scent of salt, call it our life.

Without even leaving one’s door,
One can know the whole world.
—Laozi



The rumble of the night sounds
even in the bright daylight
of morning. Life blooms amid
the Ten Thousand Things, but
does not bloom amid the Ten
Thousand Things. Shrivel-eyed
I wake up and tend to the One
here and now, clamoring to be
let out. Down with the gate,
out with the boy, to the rooms
of life’s necessities, first
to void and next to fill.
The Order is only order which
is disorder, the only Disorder
is the disorder that is order.
We usher ourselves, each in our
own way, back down the way
for various brushings, combings,
other groomings. Each in our
own way we urge the other
toward some kind of growth:
one to assume, the other   
to renounce; one to grow larger,
the other to grow smaller,
thereby growing larger. Words
do not work, and when they do not,
other words might. This makes
more sense than it seems, works
more often than it doesn’t,
except when it really doesn’t,
and then that disorder creeps
back in. In five minutes,
a different challenge. In five
hours, a different One. Six
more hours, the One is rubbing
eyes, untangled like a dragon,
shucked and undone like an oyster.
The night slowly rolls abed
and the words form stories form
sleep, the sleep of the Ten
Thousand Things, the sleep
that will echo the next day
in the night’s rumbling sounds,
in the bright light of morning.

Requiem after Fauré, for my father



Rest before you sleep         You’ll be walking for hours   then         as usual         away from home         your shoes   in your hand         your feet not yet used to the road   Perhaps they need to feel the gravel   to know where they’re headed  A woman I knew         who lived mostly in the woods   mentioned the danger in presuming to know   what an animal thinks         The fox         for example   stopping by her open tent and looking in  I suppose she would’ve felt this way about your feet   She would’ve said how could anyone know   what a pair of tired feet need along the way  I would’ve asked her how she knew the feet   were tired         Such discourse produces nothing but anything less would be silence   and that would be intolerable   I wish I knew why I was telling you this  It’s easier to read the mind of a fox than to guess   what a man’s about to say when he returns   from the woods         head full of roots         veins   more like branches         shoes in one hand         feet   blistered         and none of this necessarily   an indication of how the feet feel         what miles   uphill and back have done to the soles   and to the small bones that propel a man  It’s safe now         I think         to speak for the fox who is only as cunning as we say it is   We’re the only creatures that claim to be anything   then build a house of facts around the claim  I’ve come for vindication         No point in trying   to disguise it as a lesser wish         Wake up         stop   while you still know where you are         Put away   your elusive country         Give your sleep a rest

Well, this is nothing new, nothing to rattle the rafters in the noggin,  this moment of remembering and its kissing cousin the waking dream.  I wonder if I'll remember it? I've had a vision of a woman  reclining underneath a tree: she's about half naked and little by little  I'm sprinkling her burial mounds with grass. This is the kind of work  I like. It lets me remember, and so I do. I remember the time I laid  my homemade banjo in the fire and let it burn. There was nothing else  to burn and the house was cold; the cigar box curled inside the flames.  But the burst of heat was over soon, and once the little roar was done,  I could hear the raindrops plopping up the buckets and kettles, scattered out  like little ponds around the room. It was night and I was a boy, alone  and left to listen to that old music. I liked it. I've liked it ever since.  I loved the helpless people I loved. That's what a little boy will do,  but a grown man will turn it all to sadness and let it soak his heart  until he wrings it out and dreams about another kind of love,  some afternoon beneath a tree. Burial mounds—that's hilarious.

I am filled with snow. There's nothing to do now but wait.

They have left behind the established cave with its well-worn floor. Scholarship impels them in hundreds, but generally one by one, to find an unknown passage or scrape out their own. Proto-Semitic linguistic theory, Hittite stratigraphic anomalies, microclimatic economics. "What do you see?" invisible followers ask in their ears, and they whisper "Wonderful things" as they quarry a grain of rock at a time, or examine a fleck of ore, or measure the acidity of a trickle of water. See! Behold! Look! Lo! they cry in season, rapt, in love, chipping away with their pocketknives, pencils, rulers, fingernails, but some have tunneled so narrowly and deep that those behind see nothing but slivers of light around an excavator's haunches.  A battered piece of a tablet is all that remains of the so-called Singer of Nab. Circa 1200 BCE, he impressed, or had impressed, some words in clay. He may have composed a religious hymn, praise to the king, a poem of love, an inventory of cattle. (He may have been she, but this is unlikely.) The lines we have could be the beginning or the middle; there may have been ten more, or hundreds. The word before this gap, in fact, means "hundreds." Hundreds led in battle, hundreds slain? A thousand times beloved, nine hundred sheep? And the standard translation of this word, here, is either "desire" or "need." But did he write of a boundless yearning, or mercantile requirements? Was he a "singer"? The scholars who care disagree.  Look at them, crouched in a long tunnel dug by means of argument over an antique syntax, warming their hands at a chunk of brick baked maybe in the time of the Trojan War, broken some moment between then and now— peering at it with penlights, squandering eyesight. They know they may crawl out hungry, mumbling, aged and gray, clutching a secret message of small import or nothing, nothing. They seem lost. They seem happy.

For RLB



Pass by the showy rose, blabbing open, suckling a shiny beetle;  pass by the changeless diamond that falls asleep in shadow—  this love is a lichen,  alga and fungus made one fleck, feeding on what it feeds,  growing slightly faster than stone into a patch of gray lace, a double thumbprint,  its bloom distinguishable, with practice, from its dormant phase,  crocheting its singular habit over time, a faithful stain bound to its home,  etching on the unmoved rock the only rune it knows.

Tell the bees. They require news of the house; they must know, lest they sicken from the gap between their ignorance and our grief. Speak in a whisper. Tie a black swatch to a stick and attach the stick to their hive. From the fortress of casseroles and desserts built in the kitchen these past few weeks as though hunger were the enemy, remove a slice of cake and lay it where they can slowly draw it in, making a mournful sound.  And tell the fly that has knocked on the window all day. Tell the redbird that rammed the glass from outside and stands too dazed to go. Tell the grass, though it's already guessed, and the ground clenched in furrows; tell the water you spill on the ground, then all the water will know. And the last shrunken pearl of snow in its hiding place.  Tell the blighted elms, and the young oaks we plant instead. The water bug, while it scribbles a hundred lines that dissolve behind it. The lichen, while it etches deeper its single rune. The boulders, letting their fissures widen, the pebbles, which have no more to lose, the hills—they will be slightly smaller, as always,  when the bees fly out tomorrow to look for sweetness and find their way because nothing else has changed.

And then came the ten moons Full in the sun’s glare, and the seraphim, And it was light all night in the orchards And on the plains and even in the towns And mankind rejoiced, because it was now the case That the wrecking and equivocating could carry on The pale night long. Mankind rejoiced And went forth to those places twelve hours of light Had not made it worth the while to despoil And gamboled collectively on the cliff tops And regarded the night-broiling of the sea Hitherto forbidden, but now opened in festival. Half the world’s time unpeeled and exposed So fruit might ripen faster and trees flourish higher And forced photosynthesis green all the land. Then night ramblers, night-sun-worshippers, Night-motorists fanned out and made the most Of spectral light, which bleached out stars and even The cozy old moon herself, who had Once held a sickle broadside to the sun, and now Was a hollow daytime shadow.   Only a few old believers slept Hand in hand, shoulder to breast,   As if their lives depended on it, knowing yet That the morning would bring nothing Because the day knew no beginning And had no end.

The city humid, the church rusty and Baroque, and the directions appalling, the Miami sky turned gray as a blanket, and soon tropical rain was falling; the priest repeatedly invoked the Beast in View, as if he were stalling; and in the back a few ushers whipped out their cell phones and started calling. What of the palm scrub, through which mildewed creatures came crawling, or the two cousins from Chicago, who at the reception couldn't stop brawling? All weddings are madness, and except for the sherbet-hued bridesmaids not even a little enthralling. But the stooped and aged, what in their moth-eaten hours were they recalling? Some first nervous kiss, perhaps, the razor of a touch, and all that "Baby Doll"-ing; then the mortgage in Opa-Locka, nine months of waiting, and half a life of squalling.

Of Mina-sarpilili-anda II, the only surviving record is this splendid bas-relief in which he presses the neck of his Hittite foe beneath one battle-shod foot while minions shoulder the spoils of a conquered city.                                                                     In fact there was no war that year; a bored stone-carver was looking for preferment. He received an allowance of good wine. In a perfumed cloud of dust that loitered over the plain, Hittite ambassadors came to the king with golden bells and rosewater candy, birds in cages and spotted cats, and departed in peace. The king was beloved, laughed often, feared nothing, and died in his bed of poison.                                    A carnelian image of his second-best wife, accurate to the last mole, was plucked from the dirt by a boy tending goats, sold, and spirited out of the country, rolled in a rug, on a ship that sank on a cloudless day. An image of his first wife, in chrysoprase, lies tightly packed in buried rubble for the next generation of archaeologists— should they prove worthy, persistent, and slyer than goatherds.

  Philip Gallo is a typographer-poet, or "typoet," and his work depends on the careful alignment of simple words for its effects. "untitled" makes reference to the concrete poetry of the middle of the twentieth century. Diter Rot, whose name serves as the central text of this poem, was famous for a number of rigid typographical poems, including one that played with the letters "t" and "u" to produce, in varying ways, the words "tu" (you) and "ut" ("do" on the musical scale). Gallo's poem also appears to allude to "ping pong" by Eugen Gomringer, another early concrete poet.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>

  derek beaulieu often works at the edges of language, using isolated letters to create visual, instead of verbal, patterns and deconstructing found texts to tease out hidden meanings. His "untitled (for Natalee and Jeremy)," produced for two of his friends, is either a visual poetry epithalamium or simply a joyous celebration of the physical beauties of lettershape and writing. The resulting poem, which is created with press-on type, gains most of its effects from the repetition of identical letters, visual poetry's equivalent to rhyme, consonance, and assonance.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>

  The world of visual poetry is known for its collaborations, and some visual poets create a large percentage of their works in this way. What is interesting about K.S. Ernst and Sheila E. Murphy's collaborations is how seamless they are, as if created from one intelligence, even though the poets come from different areas of major practice. Ernst is highly attuned to the world of the visual arts, producing works designed for gallery spaces. Murphy is an active textual poet and a more recent participant in visual poetry. In "Vortextique," the vortex before us is literal: a maelstrom of words that suggests the ultimate artificiality of linguistic signs, the ambiguity of speech, and the impossibility of absolutely accurate communication.—Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>

The field is filled  with what we see without sleep. Never completely  closed, it quickly erodes  when tilled before rain.   If clogged with boulders it won’t be razed and once burdened cannot quicken under flocks.  The field reveals glint and holds leaning, pulls twist from taut knots of buds.  We watch the field  for stirring, wait  for stems to spring  back from sparrows.  We hope for a swell  in its middle so  we can say we saw  the sway that comes from noticing.   Water meanders to prairie potholes,  throws cordgrass into switchbacks as we push past  bramble and scare  a whistling wheel of geese into air.  The field draws hawks and sides of trains, cradles pools from storms where ducks plumb for water snails.   We trample light  between us, no way to lope in parting the swales. We must flatten  to fill the space with all the rolling wrapped up in us.   Before home,  the gabled barn  across the road throws the brightest rise we’ve ever seen the field try on.   The field is not in rows, is not  a faded saw-songed croon. It pushes green a mist above mud, shows how we make do.  We wonder what we’re not  in the field. What scours, cuts, or knocks. If we could stay and still feel full the low line rounding  out a spread of subtle slope.

No animals were harmed in the making of this joyful noise: A thick, twisted stem from the garden is the wedding couple's ceremonial ram's horn. Its substance will not survive one thousand years, nor will the garden, which is today their temple, nor will their names, nor their union now announced with ritual blasts upon the zucchini shofar. Shall we measure blessings by their duration? Through the narrow organic channel fuzzily come the prescribed sustained notes, short notes, rests. All that rhythm requires. Among their talents, the newlyweds excel at making and serving mustard-green soup and molasses cookies, and taking nieces and nephews for walks in the woods. The gardener dyes eggs with onion skins, wraps presents, tells stories, finds the best seashells; his friends adore his paper-cuttings— "Nothing I do will last," he says. What is this future approval we think we need; who made passing time our judge? Do we want butter that endures for ages, or butter that melts into homemade cornbread now? —the note that rings in my deaf ear without ceasing, or two voices abashed by the vows they undertake? This moment's chord of earthly commotion will never be struck exactly so again— though love does love to repeat its favorite lines. So let the shofar splutter its slow notes and quick notes, let the nieces and nephews practice their flutes and trombones, let living room pianos invite unwashed hands, let glasses of different fullness be tapped for their different notes, let everyone learn how to whistle, let the girl dawdling home from her trumpet lesson pause at the half-built house on the corner, where the newly installed maze of plumbing comes down to one little pipe whose open end she can reach, so she takes a deep breath and makes the whole house sound.

‘Tis true, ‘tis day, what though it be? O wilt thou therefore rise from me? Why should we rise because ‘tis light? Did we lie down because ‘twas night? Love, which in spite of darkness brought us hither, Should in despite of light keep us together.  Light hath no tongue, but is all eye; If it could speak as well as spy, This were the worst that it could say, That being well I fain would stay, And that I loved my heart and honour so, That I would not from him, that had them, go.  Must business thee from hence remove? Oh, that’s the worst disease of love, The poor, the foul, the false, love can Admit, but not the busied man. He which hath business, and makes love, doth do Such wrong, as when a married man doth woo.

Come up from the fields father, here’s a letter from our Pete, And come to the front door mother, here’s a letter from thy dear son.  Lo, ’tis autumn, Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder, Cool and sweeten Ohio’s villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind, Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis’d vines,   (Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines? Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)  Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with wondrous clouds,   Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well.  Down in the fields all prospers well, But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter’s call, And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.  Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling, She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.  Open the envelope quickly,   O this is not our son’s writing, yet his name is sign’d, O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother’s soul! All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main words only, Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken to hospital, At present low, but will soon be better.

“Is my team ploughing,    That I was used to drive And hear the harness jingle    When I was man alive?”  Ay, the horses trample,    The harness jingles now; No change though you lie under    The land you used to plough.  “Is football playing    Along the river shore, With lads to chase the leather,    Now I stand up no more?”  Ay the ball is flying,    The lads play heart and soul; The goal stands up, the keeper    Stands up to keep the goal.  “Is my girl happy,    That I thought hard to leave, And has she tired of weeping    As she lies down at eve?”  Ay, she lies down lightly,    She lies not down to weep: Your girl is well contented.    Be still, my lad, and sleep.  “Is my friend hearty,    Now I am thin and pine, And has he found to sleep in    A better bed than mine?”  Yes, lad, I lie easy,    I lie as lads would choose; I cheer a dead man’s sweetheart,    Never ask me whose.

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,        Alone and palely loitering? The sedgesedge Grasslike or rushlike plant that grows in wet areas. has withered from the lake,        And no birds sing.  O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,        So haggardhaggard Wild looking and so woe-begonebegone To happen, occur, transpire ? The squirrel’s granary is full,        And the harvest’s done.  I see a lily on thy brow,        With anguish moist and fever-dew, And on thy cheeks a fading rose        Fast withereth too.  I met a lady in the meadsmeads Meadow ,        Full beautiful—a faery’s child, Her hair was long, her foot was light,        And her eyes were wild.  I made a garland for her head,        And bracelets too, and fragrant zone; She looked at me as she did love,        And made sweet moanmade sweet moan Compare "virgin-choir to make delicious moan" from Ode to Psyche (30), written between April 21 and 30, 1819. Noted by John Barnard in John Keats: The Complete Poems (Penguin, 2003).   I set her on my pacing steed,        And nothing else saw all day long, For sidelong would she bend, and sing        A faery’s song.  She found me roots of relish sweet,        And honey wild, and manna-dewhoney wild, and manna-dew Echoes manna in the Bible, first described in Exodus, 16:14-21, 31. The Israelites eat the manna, a food miraculously supplied in the wilderness after the dew has lifted, in the morning: “The house of Israel called it manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey” (Exodus 16:31, NRSV)., And sure in language strange she said—        ‘I love thee true’.  She took me to her Elfin grotElfin grot An elf’s grotto ,        And there she wept and sighed full sore, And there I shut her wild wild eyes        With kisses four.  And there she lullèd me asleep,        And there I dreamed—Ah! woe betide!— The latest dream I ever dreamt        On the cold hill side.  I saw pale kings and princes too,        Pale warriors, death-pale were they all; They cried—‘La Belle Dame sans MerciLa Belle Dame sans Merci This phrase—and the poem’s title—is from Alain Chartier’s courtly French ballad, “La Belle Dame sans Merci” (1424). Keats wrote the poem in a letter to George and Georgiana Keats, April 21, 1819.        Thee hathThee hath The version of this poem has “Thee hath” (see The Letters of John Keats, 1814-1821, ed. H. E. Rollins, 1958); though other versions of this poem reads “Hath thee” in thrall!’  I saw their starved lips in the gloamgloam Twilight; Keats coined the word from “gloaming”,        With horrid warning gapèd wide, And I awoke and found me here,        On the cold hill’s side.  And this is why I sojournsojourn To stay or visit temporarily here,        Alone and palely loitering, Though the sedge is withered from the lake,        And no birds sing.

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,    Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun; ConspiringConspiring Working together; literally, to conspire is “to breathe together” (OED) with him how to load and bless    With fruit the vines that round the thatch-evesthatch-eves Thatch-eaves, the edge of thatched roofs run; To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,    And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;       To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells    With a sweet kernel; to set budding more, And still more, later flowers for the bees, Until they think warm days will never cease,       For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.  Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?    Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,    Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowingwinnowing Separating the wheat from the chaff, the heavy from the light wind; Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,    Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hookhook Scythe       Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers: And sometimes like a gleanergleaner One who gathers the remaining food after the reaper has harvested the field thou dost keep    Steady thy ladenladen Loaded down head across a brook;    Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,       Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.  Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?Where are they? Rhetorical convention known as ubi sunt, often appearing in poems that meditate on the transitory nature of life and the inevitability of death.    Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,— While barred clouds bloombloom “to colour with a soft warm tint or glow” (OED)  the soft-dying day,    And touch the stubble-plainsstubble-plains Fields made up of stubble, the remaining stumps of grain left after reaping with rosy hue; Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn    Among the river sallowssallows Willow trees, borne aloft       Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies; And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;    Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft    The red-breast whistles from a garden-croftgarden-croft A croft is a small enclosed field;       And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

To the battle? Now? What's a battle to an old man                     Like me. O barricades of washed-up words,                     Stanzas filling books with my heart's murmurs,                     My love is lined with lies and sweetened                     With the sweetest white sugar. My thoughts are rusty,                     My feelings but smoky furniture                     And scraps of youthful rage gone by.                     All this, piled on the barricades.                     But whither my flag, my withering flag?                     Spring is in my heart again and winter in my eyes,                     Fall in my arms and frost in my toes.

They crouch over books by lamplight.                   The students. How studious!                   Till dawn breaks they study and maybe read my poems                              of yore.

There is a window                   Ancient, arched, and there she sits with her hand stroking                     The hair of her . . . head. O, my studious one,                   I begged to see you, only to see, not to touch,                   Not to sit in your room, only to know your name,                   To call your name, O your name, your name and your                              name and your name.                   I'll peep stealthily . . .           Enough, I can't read anymore.  JOE: Do you know what this means?  RACHEL: I know.  JOE:   The end of my glorious dissertation. The end of the literature            department's rising star. I'll remain a teaching assistant forever. I            might as well go back to the army.  RACHEL: I won't let you, I love you.  JOE:   So what? I'll sit and start writing on a new subject. Come to me          in four years when I'm done . . .    RACHEL: You're out of your mind.  JOE:   . . . only to discover, like Sisyphus, that it was all for naught.          [Despairingly.] What an idiot! And just yesterday I wrote the            final chapter! [Sarcastically.] Here, look, the dissertation          that will revolutionize the appreciation of D.G. Castleman's poetry.  RACHEL: [Sweetly.] And I drew the letters on the cover: "D.G.

Thou two-faced year, Mother of Change and Fate,Didst weep when Spain cast forth with flaming sword, The children of the prophets of the Lord,Prince, priest, and people, spurned by zealot hate.Hounded from sea to sea, from state to state, The West refused them, and the East abhorred. No anchorage the known world could afford, Close-locked was every port, barred every gate. Then smiling, thou unveil’dst, O two-faced year, A virgin world where doors of sunset part, Saying, "Ho, all who weary, enter here!There falls each ancient barrier that the art Of race or creed or rank devised, to rearGrim bulwarked hatred between heart and heart!"

The writer had settled in England in 1771 on Garrick’s invitation to superintend scene-painting at Drury Lane. The Envoy to Constantinople was the seventh Earl of Elgin, who arranged for the Parthenon frieze to be conveyed to England in 1803.



May it please Lord Elgin, Earl of Kincardine,   
to consider the undersign’d, sole author   
and inventor of the Eidophusikon, 
for the position so lately rejected
by Mr. Turner. On giving the measure
of its Effects—calm & storm both, sunset 
or moonlight, the accurate imitation
of Nature’s sounds: approaching thunder, the dash   
of waves on a pebbly beach, the distant gun— 
my Device was pronounc’d by no less a judge
than Richard Wilson, R.A.—the same who cried out   
at the sight of Terni Cascade, “O well done, 
water, by God!”—was pronounc’d, I say, by him   
“highly successful in agitated seas,”   
by reason of the high finish carrying 
severally their satellites of color   
into the very center of the Pictures.
As it happens, your Lordship, I visited 
the same Joseph Turner known to your Lordship   
(I believe) only this week, and found a man   
pacing to and fro before his pale muslin 
on which the sick and wan Sun, in all the doubt   
of darkness, was not allow’d to shed one ray,   
but tears. Even as he work’d, pouring wet paint 
onto paper till it was saturated,
then tore, then scratch’d, then scrubb’d in a frenzy   
at the sheet, the Whole being chaos, until 
as if by enchantment, the Scene appear’d then,   
great ships gone to pieces in order to fling   
magical oranges on the waves—but I 
digress: even as he shew’d me two books fill’d   
with studies from Nature, several tinted
on the spot—which he found, he said, much the most 
valuable to him—this Turner discuss’d
the present urgency of your Lordship’s need   
for an artist who might draw Antiquities, 
with suitable finish, before Removal,
by your Lordship’s design, from Athens. He said   
he could not, himself, endure the Ideal, 
but enjoy’d and look’d for only litter—why   
even his richest vegetation is confus’d,
he delights in shingle, debris and mere heaps 
of fallen stone. Upon communicating
the intelligence that your Lordship’s stipend   
must include assistance to Lady Elgin 
in decorating fire-screens and the like,
the man turn’d back in some heat to his labor   
upon what I took to be that mysterious 
forest below London Bridge, where great ships ride,   
sails filling or falling, disorder’d too   
by the stress of anchorage, all beautiful 
though wild beneath the Daemonic pressure   
of his inquiry (with so much of the trowel,   
surely a touch more finishing might be borne!). 
Enough of Turner, I have not to speak here
of him, though what I saw was but the scribbling 
of Painting, surely. What I would say is this: 
I venture to suggest in myself a man
your Lordship, and my Lady, most certainly,   
might rely upon for accurate Service, 
work of a conclusive polish, not a sketch.   
There is, may I make so bold, a point at which   
in Turner’s Picturesque, as Fuseli says, 
two spiders, caressing or killing each other,   
must have greatly the advantage, in roughness   
of surface and intricacy of motion, 
over every athletic or am’rous   
Symplegma left by the Ancients. I do not
wish to speak further of the man who renounc’d 
your Lordship’s commission to copy marbles,   
muttering (though plain to hear), “Antiquities
be damn’d, by Thames’ shore we will die,” and went on 
raking at the sea with his untidy thumb;   
but only to call your Lordship’s kind notice   
and gracious favor, for the appointed task, 
to the creator of the Eidophusikon,
these many years a loyal British subject,    Yours, &c.

The writer is John Ruskin, on his wedding journey in Venice.



My dearest father, it is the year’s First Day,
      Yet so like the Last, in Venice, no one
            Could tell this birth from the lees.
                  I know it is some while
Since you received a word of mine: there has been   
      The shabbiest sort of interruption   
            To our exchanges (to mine
                  At least) in the shape
Of a fever—nights of those imaginings,   
      Strange but shameful too, of the Infinite   
            By way of bedcovers and
                  Boa constrictors,
With cold wedges of ice, as I thought, laid down   
      At the corners of the bed, making me   
            Slip to its coiling center
                  Where I could not breathe.   
You knew from my last, I think, I had again
      Gone to the Zoological Gardens
            And seen the great boa take
                  Rabbits, which gave me   
An idea or two, and a headache. Then
      I had too much wine that same night, & dreamed
            Of a walk with Nurse, to whom
                  I showed a lovely
Snake I promised her was an innocent one:
      It had a slender neck with a green ring
            Round it, and I made her feel
                  The scales. When she bade
Me feel them too, it turned to a fat thing, like   
      A leech, and adhered to my hand, so that   
            I could scarcely pull it off—
                  And I awakened
(So much, father, for my serpentine fancies)   
      To a vermillion dawn, fever fallen,
            And the sea horizon dark,
                  Sharp and blue, and far
Beyond it, faint with trebled distance, came on   
      The red vertical cliffs in a tremor
            Of light I could not see without   
                  Recalling Turner
Who had taught me so to see it, yet the whole   
      Subdued to one soft gray. And that morning   
            I had your letter, father,
                  Telling of the death
Of my earthly master. How much more I feel   
      This now (perhaps it is worth noting here   
            The appearance of my first
                  Gray hair, this morning)
—More than I thought I should: everything
      In the sun, in the sky so speaks of him,
            So mourns their Great Witness lost.
                  Today, the weather
Is wretched, cold and rainy, dark like England   
      At this season. I do begin to lose
            All faith in these provinces.
                  Even the people
Look to me ugly, except children from eight   
      To fourteen, who here as in Italy
            Anywhere are glorious:
                  So playful and bright
In expression, so beautiful in feature,
      So dark in eye and soft in hair—creatures   
            Quite unrivalled. At fifteen
                  They degenerate
Into malignant vagabonds, or sensual
      Lumps of lounging fat. And this latter-day
            Venice, father! where by night
                  The black gondolas
Are just traceable beside one, as if Cadmus
      Had sown the wrong teeth and grown dragons, not
            Men. The Grand Canal, this month,
                  Is all hung, from end
To end, with carpets and tapestries like a street
      Of old-clothes warehouses. And now there is
            Even talk of taking down,
                  Soon, Tintoretto’s    Paradise to “restore” it. Father, without
      The Turner Gallery, I do believe
            I should go today and live
                  In a cave on some
Cliffside—among crows. Oh what fools they are, this
      Restoring pack, yet smoothing all manner
            Of rottenness up with words.   
                  My Turner would not Phrase like these, and only once in all the years
      I knew him said, “Thank you, Mr. Ruskin.”
            My own power, if it be that,   
                  Would be lost by mere
Fine Writing. You know I promised no Romance—
      I promised them Stones. Not even bread.
            Father, I do not feel any
                  Romance in Venice!   
Here is no “abiding city,” here is but
      A heap of ruins trodden underfoot
            By such men as Ezekiel
                  Angrily describes,
Here are lonely and stagnant canals, bordered
      For the most part by blank walls of gardens
            (Now waste ground) or by patches
                  Of mud, with decayed   
Black gondolas lying keel-upmost, sinking
      Gradually into the putrid soil.
            To give Turner’s joy of this
                  Place would not take ten
Days of study, father, or of residence:
      It is more than joy that must be the great   
            Fact I would teach. I am not sure,   
                  Even, that joy is
A fact. I am certainly only of the strong   
      Instinct in me (I cannot reason this)   
            To draw, delimit the things
                  I love—oh not for
Reputation or the good of others or
      My own advantage, but a sort of need,
            Like that for water and food.
                  I should like to draw
All Saint Mark’s, stone by stone, and all this city,   
      Oppressive and choked with slime as it is   
            (Effie of course declares, each
                  Day, that we must leave:
A woman cannot help having no heart, but   
      That is hardly a reason she should have   
            No manners), yes, to eat it
                  All into my mind—
Touch by touch. I have been reading Paradise        Regained lately, father. It seems to me   
            A parallel to Turner’s
                  Last pictures—the mind
Failing altogether, yet with intervals
      And such returns of power! “Thereupon   
            Satan, bowing low his gray   
                  Dissimulation,
Disappeared.” Now he is gone, my dark angel,
      And I never had such a conception
            Of the way I must mourn—not
                  What I lose, now, but
What I have lost, until now. Yet there is more   
      Pain knowing that I must forget it all,   
            That in a year I shall have
                  No more awareness
Of his loss than of that fair landscape I saw,   
      Waking, the morning your letter arrived,
            No more left about me than
                  A fading pigment.
All the present glory, like the present pain,
      Is no use to me; it hurts me rather
            From my fear of leaving it,
                  Of losing it, yet
I know that were I to stay here, it would soon
      Cease being glory to me—that it has
            Ceased, already, to produce
                  The impression and
The delight. I can bear only the first days   
      At a place, when all the dread of losing   
            Is lost in the delirium
                  Of its possession.
I daresay love is very well when it does not   
      Mean leaving behind, as it does always,
            Somehow, with me. I have not
                  The heart for more now,
Father, though I thank you and Mother for all   
      The comfort of your words. They bring me,
            With his loss, to what I said
                  Once, the lines on this
Place you will know: “The shore lies naked under   
      The night, pathless, comfortless and infirm
            In dark languor, still except
                  Where salt runlets plash
Into tideless pools, or seabirds flit from their   
      Margins with a questioning cry.” The light
            Is gone from the waters with
                  My fallen angel,
Gone now as all must go. Your loving son, 
                                                 JOHN

I wore a large brim hat
like the women in the ads.
How thin I was: such skin.
Yes. It was Indianapolis;
a taste of sin. 
You had a natural Afro;
no money for a haircut.
We were in the seedy part;
the buildings all run-down;
the record shop, the jazz
impeccable. We moved like
the blind, relying on our touch.
At the corner coffee shop,
after an hour’s play, with our
serious game on paper,
the waitress asked us
to move on. It wasn’t much. 
Oh mortal love, your bones
were beautiful. I traced them
with my fingers. Now the light
grows less. You were so angular.
The air darkens with steel
and smoke. The cracked world
about to disintegrate,
in the arms of my total happiness.

i was leaving my fifty-eighth year
when a thumb of ice
stamped itself hard near my heart 
you have your own story
you know about the fears the tears
the scar of disbelief 
you know that the saddest lies
are the ones we tell ourselves
you know how dangerous it is 
to be born with breasts
you know how dangerous it is
to wear dark skin 
i was leaving my fifty-eighth year
when i woke into the winter
of a cold and mortal body 
thin icicles hanging off
the one mad nipple weeping 
have we not been good children
did we not inherit the earth 
but you must know all about this
from your own shivering life

When I think of the man who lived in the house
behind ours and how he killed his wife
and then went into his own back yard,
a few short feet from my bedroom window,
and put the blue-black barrel of his 30.06
inside his mouth and pulled the trigger,
I do not think about how much of the barrel
he had to swallow before his fingers reached the trigger,
nor the bullet that passed out the back of his neck,
nor the wild orbit of blood that followed
his crazy dance before he collapsed in a clatter
over the trash cans, which woke me. 
Instead I think of how quickly his neighbors restored
his humanity, remembering his passion
for stars which brought him into his yard
on clear nights, with a telescope and tripod,
or the way he stood in the alley in his rubber boots
and emptied the red slurry from his rock tumblers
before he washed the glassy chunks of agate
and petrified wood. And we remembered, too,
the goose-neck lamp on the kitchen table
that burned after dinner and how he worked
in its bright circle to fashion flies and lures.
The hook held firmly in a jeweler’s vise, 
while he wound the nylon thread around the haft
and feathers. And bending closer to the light,
he concentrated on tying the knots, pulling them tight
against the coiled threads. And bending closer still,
turning his head slightly toward the window,
his eyes lost in the dark yard, he took the thread ends
in his teeth and chewed them free. Perhaps he saw us
standing on the sidewalk watching him, perhaps he didn’t.
He was a man so much involved with what he did,
and what he did was so much of his loneliness,
our presence didn’t matter. No one’s did.
So careful and precise were all his passions, 
he must have felt the hook with its tiny barbs
against his lip, sharp and trigger-shaped.
It must have been a common danger for him—
the wet clear membrane of his mouth threatened
by the flies and lures, the beautiful enticements
he made with his own hands and the small loose
thread ends which clung to the roof of his mouth
and which he tried to spit out like an annoyance
that would choke him.

don’t ever get the idea I am a poet; you can see me
at the racetrack any day half drunk
betting quarters, sidewheelers and straight thoroughs,
but let me tell you, there are some women there
who go where the money goes, and sometimes when you
look at these whores these onehundreddollar whores
you wonder sometimes if nature isn’t playing a joke
dealing out so much breast and ass and the way
it’s all hung together, you look and you look and
you look and you can’t believe it; there are ordinary women
and then there is something else that wants to make you
tear up paintings and break albums of Beethoven
across the back of the john; anyhow, the season
was dragging and the big boys were getting busted,
all the non-pros, the producers, the cameraman,
the pushers of Mary, the fur salesman, the owners
themselves, and Saint Louie was running this day:
a sidewheeler that broke when he got in close;
he ran with his head down and was mean and ugly
and 35 to 1, and I put a ten down on him.
the driver broke him wide
took him out by the fence where he’d be alone
even if he had to travel four times as far,
and that’s the way he went it
all the way by the outer fence
traveling two miles in one
and he won like he was mad as hell
and he wasn’t even tired,
and the biggest blonde of all
all ass and breast, hardly anything else
went to the payoff window with me. 
that night I couldn’t destroy her
although the springs shot sparks
and they pounded on the walls.
later she sat there in her slip
drinking Old Grandad
and she said
what’s a guy like you doing
living in a dump like this?
and I said
I’m a poet 
and she threw back her beautiful head and laughed. 
you? you . . . a poet? 
I guess you’re right, I said, I guess you’re right. 
but still she looked good to me, she still looked good,
and all thanks to an ugly horse
who wrote this poem.

he lives in a house with a swimming pool
and says the job is
killing him.
he is 27. I am 44. I can’t seem to
get rid of
him. his novels keep coming
back. “what do you expect me to do?” he screams
“go to New York and pump the hands of the
publishers?”
“no,” I tell him, “but quit your job, go into a
small room and do the
thing.”
“but I need ASSURANCE, I need something to
go by, some word, some sign!”
“some men did not think that way:
Van Gogh, Wagner—”
“oh hell, Van Gogh had a brother who gave him
paints whenever he
needed them!” 
“look,” he said, “I’m over at this broad’s house today and
this guy walks in. a salesman. you know
how they talk. drove up in this new
car. talked about his vacation. said he went to
Frisco—saw Fidelio up there but forgot who
wrote it. now this guy is 54 years
old. so I told him: ‘Fidelio is Beethoven’s only
opera.’ and then I told
him: ‘you’re a jerk!’ ‘whatcha mean?’ he
asked. ‘I mean, you’re a jerk, you’re 54 years old and
you don’t know anything!’” 
“what happened
then?”
“I walked out.”
“you mean you left him there with
her?”
“yes.” 
“I can’t quit my job,” he said. “I always have trouble getting a
job. I walk in, they look at me, listen to me talk and
they think right away, ah ha! he’s too intelligent for
this job, he won’t stay
so there’s really no sense in hiring
him.
now, YOU walk into a place and you don’t have any trouble:
you look like an old wino, you look like a guy who needs a
job and they look at you and they think:
ah ha!: now here’s a guy who really needs work! if we hire
him he’ll stay a long time and work
HARD!” 
“do any of those people,” he asks “know you are a
writer, that you write poetry?”
“no.”
“you never talk about
it. not even to
me! if I hadn’t seen you in that magazine I’d
have never known.”
“that’s right.”
“still, I’d like to tell these people that you are a
writer.”
“I’d still like to
tell them.”
“why?”
“well, they talk about you. they think you are just a
horseplayer and a drunk.”
“I am both of those.”
“well, they talk about you. you have odd ways. you travel alone.
I’m the only friend you
have.”
“yes.”
“they talk you down. I’d like to defend you. I’d like to tell
them you write
poetry.”
“leave it alone. I work here like they
do. we’re all the same.”
“well, I’d like to do it for myself then. I want them to know why
I travel with
you. I speak 7 languages, I know my music—”
“forget it.”
“all right, I’ll respect your
wishes. but there’s something else—”
“what?”
“I’ve been thinking about getting a
piano. but then I’ve been thinking about getting a
violin too but I can’t make up my
mind!”
“buy a piano.”
“you think
so?”
“yes.” 
he walks away
thinking about
it. 
I was thinking about it
too: I figure he can always come over with his
violin and more
sad music.

The thing about a shark is—teeth,
One row above, one row beneath. 
Now take a close look. Do you find
It has another row behind? 
Still closer—here, I’ll hold your hat:
Has it a third row behind that? 
Now look in and...Look out! Oh my,

We finished clearing the last
Section of trail by noon,
High on the ridge-side
Two thousand feet above the creek
Reached the pass, went on
Beyond the white pine groves,
Granite shoulders, to a small
Green meadow watered by the snow,
Edged with Aspen—sun
Straight high and blazing
But the air was cool.
Ate a cold fried trout in the
Trembling shadows. I spied
A glitter, and found a flake
Black volcanic glass—obsidian—
By a flower. Hands and knees
Pushing the Bear grass, thousands
Of arrowhead leavings over a
Hundred yards. Not one good
Head, just razor flakes
On a hill snowed all but summer,
A land of fat summer deer,
They came to camp. On their
Own trails. I followed my own
Trail here. Picked up the cold-drill,
Pick, singlejack, and sack
Of dynamite.
Ten thousand years.

Good morning kiss. Their teeth glance. Clack of June
bugs against pane. On the porch a young man
in the full sun rocking.
Jars incubate tomato plants. His mother sweeps the dirt
yard away from flowering vinca and bottle tree.
Straightens up, one-eyed by ragged hens. As her boy
ambles away to the steady pulse
in his skull.
The cattle gate
swinging open behind him.
She takes a headache powder
and it is nineteen and twenty seven.
The James overruns its levee, backs up
the Blackwater. Nineteen and twenty nine: she reads his postcard,
the tobacco crop burns. Nineteen and thirty, drought.
Long limp bags drag through fields. The Lord whistles
for the fly. Revival tents threaten a rain
of scorpions. To cure her hiccups,
the woman sees a hypnotist. Promptly
coughs herself to death. In pungs marked men ride. The son
is blown away. No one returns in this story. No one escapes.
The tribe is glued together for ruination, friends.
There is no more time, there is no way out.

I 
Once I had 1000 roses.
Literally 1000 roses.
I was working for a florist
back in the shambling ‘Thirties
when iced skids of 250 roses
sold for $2 at Faneuil Hall.
So for $8 I bought
1000 roses, 500
white and 500 red,
for Connie’s wedding to steadiness. 
I strewed the church aisle whole
and the bride came walking
on roses, roses all the way:
The white roses and the red roses.
White for the bed we had shared.
Red for the bed she went to
from the abundance in her
to the fear in what she wanted.
The gift was not in the roses
but in the abundance of the roses. 
                                                   To her
whose abundance had never wholly
been mine, and could never be his.
He had no gift of abundance in him
but only the penuries of sobriety.
A good steady clerk, most mortgageable,
returning in creaking shoes over
the white and the red roses. Returning
over the most flowering he would ever
touch, with the most flowering I
had ever touched. A feast of endings.  
II 
This morning I passed a pushcart
heaped with white carnations
as high as if there had fallen all night
one of those thick-flaked, slow, windless,
wondering snows that leave
shakos on fence posts, polar bears
in the hedges, caves in the light,
and a childhood on every sill.
Once, twice a year, partially,
and once, twice a lifetime, perfectly, 
that snow falls. In which I ran
like a young wolf in its blood
leaping to snap the flower-flakes
clean from the air; their instant on the tongue
flat and almost dusty and not enough
to be cold. But as I ran, face-up,
mouth open, my cheeks burned
with tears and flower-melt,
and my lashes were fringed with gauze,
and my ears wore white piping. 
There is no feast but energy. All men
know—have known and will remember
again and again—what food that is
for the running young wolf of the rare days
when shapes fall from the air
and may be had for the leaping.
Clean in the mouth of joy. Flat and dusty.
And how they are instantly nothing—
a commotion in the air and in the blood.
—And how they are endlessly all.  
III 
My father’s grave, the deepest cave I know,
was banked with snow and lilies. We stuck the dead flowers
into the snow banks dirty with sand
and trampled by digger’s boots.
The flowers, stiff and unbeckoning,
ripped from their wires in the wind
and blew their seasons out as snow
Purer than the snow itself. A last
abundance correcting our poverties. 
I remember the feasts of my life,
their every flowing. I remember
the wolf all men remember in his blood.
I remember the air become
a feast of flowers. And remember
his last flowers whitening winter
in an imitation of possibility,
while we hunched black
in the dirtied place inside possibility
where the prayers soiled him. 
If ever there was a man of abundances
he lies there flowerless
at that dirty center
whose wired flowers try and try
to make the winter clean again in air.
And fail. And leave me raging
as the young wolf grown
from his day’s play in abundance
to the ravening of recollection.
Creaking to penury over the flower-strew.  
IV 
This morning I passed a pushcart
heaped beyond possibility,
as when the sun begins again
after that long snow and the earth
is moonscaped and wonderlanded
and humped and haloed in the
light it makes: an angel
on every garbage can, a god
in every tree, that childhood
on every sill.—At a corner of the ordinary. 
Where is she now? Instantly nothing.
A penury after flower-strew. Nothing.
A feast of glimpses. Not fact itself,
but an idea of the possible in the fact.
—And so the rare day comes: I was again
the young wolf trembling in his blood
at the profusions heaped and haloed
in their instant next to the ordinary.
And did not know myself what feast I kept
—till I said your name. At once all plenty was. 
It is the words starve us, the act that feeds.
The air trembling with the white wicks
of its falling encloses us. To be
perfect, I suppose, we must be brief.
The long thing is to remember
imperfectly, dirtying with gratitude
the grave of abundance. O flower-banked,
air-dazzling, and abundant woman,
though the young wolf is dead, all men
know—have known and must remember—
                        You.

                    Some students were stretching a professor on a medieval torture rack. He had offered himself to show them how an academic might be stretched beyond his wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum.
         And as they turned the wheel the professor was getting longer and longer.
         Don’t make me too long, or I’ll look kind of goofy, sighed the professor as he grew longer and longer.

         Suddenly something snaps.
         What happened? sighs the professor from the rack.
         We were just stretching an academic when suddenly something snapped; you may have heard it ...
         Yes, I was there. Don’t you remember? sighs the professor.
         And then we heard an academic sigh ...
         Yes, I heard it, too, sighs the professor, it seemed to come from the rack where I was being stretched beyond my wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum ...

The history of my stupidity would fill many volumes. 
Some would be devoted to acting against consciousness,
Like the flight of a moth which, had it known,
Would have tended nevertheless toward the candle’s flame. 
Others would deal with ways to silence anxiety,
The little whisper which, though it is a warning, is ignored. 
I would deal separately with satisfaction and pride,
The time when I was among their adherents
Who strut victoriously, unsuspecting. 
But all of them would have one subject, desire,
If only my own—but no, not at all; alas,
I was driven because I wanted to be like others.
I was afraid of what was wild and indecent in me. 
The history of my stupidity will not be written.
For one thing, it’s late. And the truth is laborious.  Berkeley, 1980.

“I’m glad you’re positive.”
“I’m glad you’re positive, 
too, though, of course, I wish
you weren’t.” I wish you weren’t 
either is the response I expect,
and you say nothing. 
And who can blame you?
Not me. I’m not the one 
who’ll call you after dinner and a movie.
You’re not the one who’ll call me. 
We both know we have
that—what?—that ultimate date 
one night to come, one bright morning.
Who can blame us? Not the forks 
and not the knives that carry on
and do the heavy lifting now.

The hounds, you know them all by name. You fostered them from purblind whelps At their dam’s teats, and you have come To know the music of their yelps:  High-strung Anthee, the brindled bitch, The blue-tick coated Philomel, And freckled Chloe, who would fetch A pretty price if you would sell—  All fleet of foot, and swift to scent, Inexorable once on the track, Like angry words you might have meant, But do not mean, and can’t take back.  There was a time when you would brag How they would bay and rend apart The hopeless belling from a stag. You falter now for the foundered hart.  Desires you nursed of a winter night— Did you know then why you bred them— Whose needling milk-teeth used to bite The master’s hand that leashed and fed them?

If endear is earned
and is meant to identify   
two halves 
then it composes   
one meaning 
which means   
a token 
a knot

of how it feels 
to have your heart   
be the dear one

Could our first father, at his toilsome plow,Thorns in his path, and labor on his brow,Clothed only in a rude, unpolished skin,Could he a vain fantastic nymph have seen,In all her airs, in all her antic graces,Her various fashions, and more various faces;How had it posed that skill, which late assignedJust appellations to each several kind!A right idea of the sight to frame;T’have guessed from what new element she came;T’have hit the wav’ring form, or giv’n this thing a name.

We sat together at one summer’s end,
That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   
And you and I, and talked of poetry.
I said, ‘A line will take us hours maybe;
Yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought,   
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   
Better go down upon your marrow-bones   
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   
Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;   
For to articulate sweet sounds together
Is to work harder than all these, and yet   
Be thought an idler by the noisy set
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   
The martyrs call the world.’
                                          And thereupon
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake   
There’s many a one shall find out all heartache   
On finding that her voice is sweet and low   
Replied, ‘To be born woman is to know—
Although they do not talk of it at school—
That we must labour to be beautiful.’
I said, ‘It’s certain there is no fine thing   
Since Adam’s fall but needs much labouring.
There have been lovers who thought love should be   
So much compounded of high courtesy   
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks   
Precedents out of beautiful old books;   
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.’ 
We sat grown quiet at the name of love;   
We saw the last embers of daylight die,   
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky   
A moon, worn as if it had been a shell   
Washed by time’s waters as they rose and fell   
About the stars and broke in days and years. 
I had a thought for no one’s but your ears:   
That you were beautiful, and that I strove   
To love you in the old high way of love;
That it had all seemed happy, and yet we’d grown   
As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.

And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field ... GEN. 2:20



Thou, paw-paw-paw; thou, glurd; thou, spotted
   Glurd; thou, whitestap, lurching through   
The high-grown brush; thou, pliant-footed,
   Implex; thou, awagabu. 
Every burrower, each flier
   Came for the name he had to give:   
Gay, first work, ever to be prior,   
   Not yet sunk to primitive. 
Thou, verdle; thou, McFleery’s pomma;
   Thou; thou; thou—three types of grawl;   
Thou, flisket; thou, kabasch; thou, comma-
   Eared mashawk; thou, all; thou, all. 
Were, in a fire of becoming,
   Laboring to be burned away,
Then work, half-measuring, half-humming,   
   Would be as serious as play. 
Thou, pambler; thou, rivarn; thou, greater   
   Wherret, and thou, lesser one;
Thou, sproal; thou, zant; thou, lily-eater.   
   Naming’s over. Day is done.

I wish we could control this revolting
want of control: these people
with their spongy eyes, their mouths
of trembling shoehorns, billhooks for penises
and bear traps for vulvas.
One taste of sunlight and at once
they can’t do without it. Water,
the same, and food, and air,
and a dozen other squalid habits.
Some—like their copulation,
a rusting carnation in a cut-glass neck—
are not physically compulsive but
the partners can’t stop wanting them to be:
so we desire to be raped
by love, who would fill us, they say,
with an oil from the lit braziers of stars.
What if, doing it every day,
we resemble pistons, and the slow poison
cuts our lives off at 70:
it’s the grim determination
of our passion. And beyond this, even I—
defended in childhood by my strong father
the piano and my mother the virtuoso
from knuckles among warehouses—even I
am addicted to the mild light of words.

Delight of Human kind, and Gods above; Parent of Rome; Propitious Queen of Love; Whose vital pow’r, Air, Earth, and Sea supplies; And breeds what e’r is born beneath the rowling Skies: For every kind, by thy prolifique might,   Springs, and beholds the Regions of the light: Thee, Goddess thee, the clouds and tempests fear, And at thy pleasing presence disappear: For thee the Land in fragrant Flow’rs is drest, For thee the Ocean smiles, and smooths her wavy breast; And Heav’n it self with more serene, and purer light is blest. For when the rising Spring adorns the Mead, And a new Scene of Nature stands display’d, When teeming Budds, and chearful greens appear, And Western gales unlock the lazy year, The joyous Birds thy welcome first express, Whose native Songs thy genial fire confess: Then savage Beasts bound o’re their slighted food, Strook with thy darts, and tempt the raging floud: All Nature is thy Gift; Earth, Air, and Sea: Of all that breathes, the various progeny, Stung with delight, is goaded on by thee. O’er barren Mountains, o’er the flow’ry Plain, The leavy Forest, and the liquid Main Extends thy uncontroul’d and boundless reign. Through all the living Regions dost thou move, And scattr’st, where thou goest, the kindly seeds of Love: Since then the race of every living thing, Obeys thy pow’r; since nothing new can spring Without thy warmth, without thy influence bear, Or beautiful, or lovesome can appear, Be thou my ayd: My tuneful Song inspire, And kindle with thy own productive fire; While all thy Province Nature, I survey, And sing to Memmius an immortal lay Of Heav’n, and Earth, and every where thy wond’rous pow’r display. To Memmius, under thy sweet influence born, Whom thou with all thy gifts and graces dost adorn. The rather, then assist my Muse and me, Infusing Verses worthy him and thee. Mean time on Land and Sea let barb’rous discord cease, And lull the listening world in universal peace. To thee, Mankind their soft repose must owe, For thou alone that blessing canst bestow; Because the brutal business of the War Is manag’d by thy dreadful Servant’s care: Who oft retires from fighting fields, to prove The pleasing pains of thy eternal Love: And panting on thy breast, supinely lies, While with thy heavenly form he feeds his famish’d eyes: Sucks in with open lips, thy balmy breath, By turns restor’d to life, and plung’d in pleasing death. There while thy curling limbs about him move, Involv’d and fetter’d in the links of Love, When wishing all, he nothing can deny, Thy charms in that auspicious moment try; With winning eloquence our peace implore, And quiet to the weary World restore.

Although it is night, I sit in the bathroom, waiting.
Sweat prickles behind my knees, the baby-breasts are alert.
Venetian blinds slice up the moon; the tiles quiver in pale strips. 
Then they come, the three seal men with eyes as round
As dinner plates and eyelashes like sharpened tines.
They bring the scent of licorice. One sits in the washbowl, 
One on the bathtub edge; one leans against the door.
“Can you feel it yet?” they whisper.
I don’t know what to say, again. They chuckle, 
Patting their sleek bodies with their hands.
“Well, maybe next time.” And they rise,
Glittering like pools of ink under moonlight, 
And vanish. I clutch at the ragged holes
They leave behind, here at the edge of darkness.
Night rests like a ball of fur on my tongue.

                    The turtle carries his house on his back. He is both the house and the person of that house.
         But actually, under the shell is a little room where the true turtle, wearing long underwear, sits at a little table. At one end of the room a series of levers sticks out of slots in the floor, like the controls of a steam shovel. It is with these that the turtle controls the legs of his house.
         Most of the time the turtle sits under the sloping ceiling of his turtle room reading catalogues at the little table where a candle burns. He leans on one elbow, and then the other. He crosses one leg, and then the other. Finally he yawns and buries his head in his arms and sleeps.
         If he feels a child picking up his house he quickly douses the candle and runs to the control levers and activates the legs of his house and tries to escape.
         If he cannot escape he retracts the legs and withdraws the so-called head and waits. He knows that children are careless, and that there will come a time when he will be free to move his house to some secluded place, where he will relight his candle, take out his catalogues and read until at last he yawns. Then he’ll bury his head in his arms and sleep....That is, until another child picks up his house....

I’m a tranquilizer.
I’m effective at home.
I work in the office.
I can take exams
on the witness stand.
I mend broken cups with care.
All you have to do is take me,
let me melt beneath your tongue,
just gulp me
with a glass of water. 
I know how to handle misfortune,
how to take bad news.
I can minimize injustice,
lighten up God’s absence,
or pick the widow’s veil that suits your face.
What are you waiting for—
have faith in my chemical compassion. 
You’re still a young man/woman.
It’s not too late to learn how to unwind.
Who said
you have to take it on the chin? 
Let me have your abyss.
I’ll cushion it with sleep.
You’ll thank me for giving you
four paws to fall on. 
Sell me your soul.
There are no other takers. 
There is no other devil anymore.

Dawn on the black hill, and up on the roof
cats drowsing. Last night, there was a boy
who fell off this roof, breaking his back.
The wind riffles the cool leaves of the trees.
The red clouds above are warm and move slowly.
A stray dog appears in the alley below, sniffing
the boy on the cobblestones, and a raw wail
rises up among chimneys: someone’s unhappy. 
The crickets were singing all night, and the stars
were blown out by the wind. In dawn’s glow,
even the eyes of the cats in love were extinguished,
the cats the boy watched. The female is crying,
no toms are around and nothing can soothe her:
not the tops of the trees, not the red clouds.
She cries to the wide sky, as if it were still night. 
The boy was spying on cats making love.
The stray dog sniffs the boy’s body and growls;
he got here at dawn, fleeing the glow
that crept down the far hill. Swimming the river
that drenched him as dew drenches fields,
he was finally caught by the light. The bitches
were still howling.
                           The river runs smoothly,
skimmed by birds that drop from red clouds,
elated to find their river deserted.

Love not too much. But how,When thou hast made me such,And dost thy gifts bestow,How can I love too much?
   Though I must fear to lose,And drown my joy in care,With all its thorns I chooseThe path of love and prayer.
    Though thou, I know not why,Didst kill my childish trust,That breach with toil did IRepair, because I must:
   And spite of frighting schemes,With which the fiends of HellBlaspheme thee in my dreams,So far I have hoped well.
    But what the heavenly key,What marvel in me wroughtShall quite exculpate thee,I have no shadow of thought.
   What am I that complain?The love, from which beganMy question sad and vain,Justifies thee to man.

In the groves of Africa from their natural wonder
the wildebeest, zebra, the okapi, the elephant,
have enterd the marvelous. No greater marvelous
know I than the mind’s
natural jungle. The wives of the Congo
distil there their red and the husbands
hunt lion with spear and paint Death-spore
on their shields, wear his teeth, claws and hair
on ordinary occasions. There the Swahili
open his doors, let loose thru the trees
the tides of Death’s sound and distil
from their leaves the terrible red. He
is the consort of dreams I have seen, heard
in the orchestral dark
like the barking of dogs. 
Death is the dog-headed man zebra striped
and surrounded by silence who walks like a lion,
who is black. It was his voice crying come back,
that Virginia Woolf heard, turnd
her fine skull, hounded and haunted, stopt,
pointed into the scent where
I see her in willows, in fog, at the river of sound
in the trees. I see her prepare there
to enter Death’s mountains
like a white Afghan hound pass into the forest,
closed after, let loose in the leaves
with more grace than a hound and more wonder there
even with flowers wound in her hair, allowing herself
like Ophelia a last
pastoral gesture of love toward the world.
          And I see
all our tortures absolved in the fog,
dispersed in Death’s forests, forgotten. I see
all this gentleness like a hound in the water
float upward and outward beyond my dark hand. 
I am waiting this winter for the more complete black-out,
for the negro armies in the eucalyptus, for the cities
laid open and the cold in the love-light, for hounds
women and birds to go back to their forests and leave us
our solitude.
 
.   .   .

   
Negroes, negroes, all those princes,
holding cups of rhinoceros bone, make
magic with my blood. Where beautiful Marijuana
towers taller than the eucalyptus, turns
within the lips of night and falls,
falls downward, where as giant Kings we gathered
and devourd her burning hands and feet, O Moonbar
thee and Clarinet! those talismans
that quickened in their sheltering leaves like thieves,
those Negroes, all those princes
holding to their mouths like Death
the cups of rhino bone,
were there to burn my hands and feet,
divine the limit of the bone and with their magic
tie and twist me like a rope. I know
no other continent of Africa more dark than this
dark continent of my breast. 
         And when we are deserted there,
when the rustling electric has passt thru the air,
once more we begin in the blind and blood throat
the African catches; and Desdemona, Desdemona
like a demon wails within our bodies, warns
against this towering Moor of self and then
laments her passing from him. 
And I cry, Hear!
Hear in the coild and secretive ear
the drums that I hear beat. The Negroes, all those princes
holding cups of bone and horn, are there in halls
of blood that I call forests, in the dark
and shining caverns where
beats heart and pulses brain, in
jungles of my body, there
Othello moves, striped black and white,
the dog-faced fear. Moves I, I, I,
whom I have seen as black as Orpheus,
pursued deliriously his sound and drownd
in hunger’s tone, the deepest wilderness. 
Then it was I, Death singing,
who bewildered the forest. I thot him
my lover like a hound of great purity
disturbing the shadow and flesh of the jungle.
This was the beginning of the ending year.
From all of the empty the tortured appear,
and the bird-faced children crawl out of their fathers
and into that never filld pocket,
the no longer asking but silent, seeing nowhere
the final sleep. 
The halls of Africa we seek in dreams
as barriers of dream against the deep, and seas
disturbd turn back upon their tides
into the rooms deserted at the roots of love.
There is no end. And how sad then
is even the Congo. How the tired sirens
come up from the water, not to be toucht
but to lie on the rocks of the thunder.
How sad then is even the marvelous!


^^EOP^^

The man I love most says one day
he will take a ballpoint pen and connect   
the stars across this freckled
scoop of chest and milky way.
We’ll cross the slope

who shows people
all the places they might shine.

only the manners of centuries ago can teach me
how to address you my lover as who you are
O Sestius, how could you put up with my children
thinking all the while you were bearing me as in your mirror
it doesn't matter anymore if spring wreaks its fiery
or lamblike dawn on my new-found asceticism, some joke
I wouldn't sleep with you or any man if you paid me
and most of you poets don't have the cash anyway
so please rejoin your fraternal books forever
while you miss in your securest sleep Ms. Rosy-fingered dawn
who might've been induced to digitalize a part of you
were it not for your self-induced revenge of undoneness
it's good to live without a refrigerator! why bother
to chill the handiwork of Ceres and of Demeter?
and of the lonesome Sappho. let's have it warm for now.

The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept
  And strewn with rushes, rosemary and mayLay thick upon the bed on which I lay,Where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept.He leaned above me, thinking that I slept
  And could not hear him; but I heard him say,
  ‘Poor child, poor child’: and as he turned awayCame a deep silence, and I knew he wept.He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold
  That hid my face, or take my hand in his,
     Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head:
     He did not love me living; but once dead
  He pitied me; and very sweet it isTo know he still is warm though I am cold.

Just when I’m ready to call in the day and put it to bed without supper
you send the mockingbird who plays with his musical zipper,
exposing the World’s underlife.
You send purfume from the autumn olive
whose septillion flowering ears are full of bees
singing songs for the revolution.
Out back Jake’s Creek is speaking in tongues— Missed you-missed you-missed you. 
You wear me down, obsessively
rubbing your hands along my better judgment,
kissing the upturned noses of all my higher principles, until   
my clothes are big as a mast sail,
until my longing leavens one thousand wedding cakes,
my longing is an undertow, and all the tourist beaches are posted: Danger. 
Come for me—I’ll break off my arms and will them to a body
of water, hang my legs up in overalls at night
so they won’t come after us, feed
English to the birds in sweet pats of butter 
Then our loving gets raucous—
white moths yapping their wings—you wag, you
    wag in the little fingerbowl of me. 
Your verbstem assumes declensions of mythic proportions.
My vowel sounds open on the south-most hallelujah side of the mountain.
Then metaphysically speaking we’ve stopped speaking   
metaphorically—Silence 
nuanced as a landscape in snow.

ON THE BIRTH OF A SON



When a child is born, the parents say
they hope it's healthy and intelligent. But as for me— 
well, vigor and intelligence have wrecked my life. I pray
this baby we are seeing walloped, wiped and winningly anointed, 
turns out dumb as oakum—and more sinister. That way
he can crown a tranquil life by being 
appointed a cabinet minister.

Every story has its lean meat
and its solid church
so he started to rape her for years.
However, owls close their eyes
in the daytime
because they’re awake all night,
and she waited for him
at the handle of his hunting knife
the bells ringing afterward
with the kind of lust
she’s always known.
After that her flights were silent
and her voice, of rats and mice.
I don’t understand sorcery or omens
even eyes as penetrating as hers,
but under her feathers
and all along the tips of her flight
where she’s let me touch her,
I’ve kissed her fright.

After the last bulletins the windows darken
And the whole city founders readily and deep,
Sliding on all its pillows
To the thronged Atlantis of personal sleep, 
And the wind rises. The wind rises and bowls
The day’s litter of news in the alleys. Trash
Tears itself on the railings,
Soars and falls with a soft crash, 
Tumbles and soars again. Unruly flights
Scamper the park, and taking a statue for dead
Strike at the positive eyes,
Batter and flap the stolid head 
And scratch the noble name. In empty lots
Our journals spiral in a fierce noyade
Of all we thought to think,
Or caught in corners cramp and wad 
And twist our words. And some from gutters flail
Their tatters at the tired patrolman’s feet,
Like all that fisted snow
That cried beside his long retreat 
Damn you! damn you! to the emperor’s horse’s heels.
Oh none too soon through the air white and dry
Will the clear announcer’s voice
Beat like a dove, and you and I 
From the heart’s anarch and responsible town
Return by subway-mouth to life again,
Bearing the morning papers,
And cross the park where saintlike men, 
White and absorbed, with stick and bag remove
The litter of the night, and footsteps rouse
With confident morning sound
The songbirds in the public boughs.


^^EOP^^

You call me to the bath, where
by evening light before bed I rub
the ointment into your maculate back.
I place my hand between the wings
of your scapulae, where you cannot
reach, cannot see—the arc of your life
revealed in its pattern of coffee-colored
spots—and hover there awhile,
remembering how we watched the lover
read the manuscript painted on the skin
of his beloved; how he pressed
the words to his chest and face—and cried out.
The arteries in my palm open, their warmth
rising between us as I massage you, neither
sexual nor umbilical,
this connection—you trusting
your back to me, and
me with no deceit.
Only salve, only unguent.
Only balm.

The best job I had was moving a stone
from one side of the road to the other.
This required a permit which required
a bribe. The bribe took all my salary.
Yet because I hadn’t finished the job
I had no salary, and to pay the bribe
I took a job moving the stone
the other way. Because the official
wanted his bribe, he gave me a permit
for the second job. When I pointed out
that the work would be best completed
if I did nothing, he complimented   
my brain and wrote a letter
to my employer suggesting promotion
on stationery bearing the wings
of a raptor spread in flight
over a mountain smaller than the bird.
My boss, fearing my intelligence,
paid me to sleep on the sofa
and take lunch with the official
who required a bribe to keep anything
from being done. When I told my parents,
they wrote my brother to come home
from university to be slapped
on the back of the head. Dutifully,
he arrived and bowed to receive
his instruction, at which point
sense entered his body and he asked
what I could do by way of a job.
I pointed out there were stones
everywhere trying not to move,
all it took was a little gumption
to be the man who didn’t move them.
It was harder to explain the intricacies
of not obtaining a permit to not
do this. Just yesterday he got up
at dawn and shaved, as if the lack
of hair on his face has anything
to do with the appearance of food
on an empty table.

We were a Colored Clan of Kinfolk
Who threw soil      not salt
Over our shoulders
Who tendered close the bible
Who grew and passed around the almanac at night
So we would know   
What to plant at first light 
Black soil and sweet brown sorghum
From the every morning biscuits
Mama Susan fixed
Dripping and mixing
Up under our fingernails
A secret salve
Just like any other
Living simple
And keeping to our proud selves
Quite aware of night riders
Quite aware of men with   
Politicious smiles
Cologned with kerosene and match 
Aware of just whose feet
Walked across our tin roofs at night 
We were such light sleepers
Such long distance believers 
We were a family pregnant
Whose water had broke
And for once there was ham money
’Bacca money
So we thought to do better by ourselves
To begin our next row
We would go and get him
Because he was medically degreed in baby bringing
Because he was young and white and handsome
And because of that
Had been neighbor to more knowledge
Than us way back behind   
The country’s proud but inferior lines 
And because he came with his papers in his pocket
So convincing      so soon
After his ivy graduation
Asking us hadn’t we heard
Telling us times had changed
And the midwife wasn’t safe anymore
Even though we had all been caught
By tried and true Black Grannies
Who lay ax blade sharp side up
And water pan underneath the bed
To cut the pain
To cool the fever 
We were a Pregnant Clan of Kinfolk
Caught with water running down our legs
Old family say they remember   
Going to fetch him
Telling him that it was time
That he should come now
But he didn’t show right away
Not right away
But came when he wanted
The next day
After his breakfast 
But what more
Could we colored country folk ever want
Even if we had to watch the road all night for him
Even if we had to not let her push too hard
When he finally came
He had his papers on him
Something with one of those pretty shiny seals
Old family say they can remember
Somethin’ just wasn’t right
But we opened the screen for him anyway
Trusting
And tendering close what the Good Book
Had told us all our lives to do 
Then we made him a path
Where he put his hand up      then inside
My grandmother’s womb
Her precious private pleasing place
Somewhere he probably didn’t want to touch 
Then he pulled my daddy through
Somebody he probably didn’t care to reach for
And from the first he pulled him wrong
And wrong
Shattered his collarbone
And snapped his soft baby foot in half
And smashed the cartilage in his infant hand 
Wringing
Their own sun baked arms
Old timey family
Remember him well
Say they knew somethin’ wasn’t right
As he came through the door
A day later
His breakfast digested now
Somethin’ just wasn’t right
How he had two waters on him
One sweet      one sour-mash
One trying to throw snow quilt over the other
As he un-carefully
As drunkenly
He with his papers on him still
Stood there turning a brown baby into blue
Un-magically
And right before our eyes 
Hope and Pray
Hope and Pray 
Then he packed his bag and      left
With all of his official training
And gathered up gold stars      left
The Virginia land of Cumberland County 
He left and forgot
He left and didn’t remember
The afterbirth inside
Carlene Godwin Finney 
To clabber
Gangrene
Close down
Her place
Her precious private pleasing place
To fill the house to the rafters
Up past the dimpled tin roof
With a rotting smell
That stayed for nine days
That mortgaged a room
In our memories
And did not die with her 
We were a Brown and Pregnant Family
And he would’ve remembered his schoolin’
And left his bottle
Recollected his manners
And brought his right mind
Had another klan called him to their bedside
He would’ve come right away
He would’ve never had liquor on his breath
If the color of my daddy’s broken limbs
Had matched the color of his own but 
We were a Colored Clan of Kinfolk
We should’ve met him at the door
Should’ve told him lean first into the rusty screen
Made him open up his mouth and blow
Breathe out right there
Into all of our brown and lined up faces
In wait of his worthiness 
Then just for good measure
Should’ve made him blow once again
Into Papa Josh’s truth telling jar
Just to be sure
Should’ve let Mama Sally
Then Aunt Nanny
Then lastly Aunt Mary   
Give him the final once over
And hold his sterile hands
Down to the firelight to check
Just like she checked our own every night
Before supper
Before we were allowed to sit
At her very particular table 
We could’ve let Aunt Ira clutch him by his chin
Enter and leave through her eyes
Just like how she came and went through us   
Everyday at her leisure 
She would’ve took care to notice
As she traveled all up and through him
Any shaking      any sweating
And caught his incapable belligerent incompetence
In time 
Oh Jesus 
We should’ve let Grandpop Robert
Have him from the first
Should’ve let him pick him up
By the back of his pants
And swirl him around
Just like he picked us up
And swirled us around
Anytime he caught us lying or lazy
Or being less than what we were 
We should’ve let Grandpop
Loose on him from the start
And he would’ve held him up
High eye to the sun
And looked straight through him
Just like he held us up
And then we would have known first
Like he always knew first
And brought to us
The very map of his heart
Then we would have known
Just what his intentions were
With our Carlene 
Before we knew his name
Or cared about his many degrees
Before he dared reach up      then inside
Our family’s brown globe
While we stood there
Some of us throwing good black soil
With one hand
Some of us tending close
The Good Book with the other
Believing and trusting
We were doing better
By this one
Standing there 
Waterfalls running
Screaming whitewater rapids 
Down our pants legs
Down our pantaloons
To our many selves 
All the while   
Praying hard
That maybe we were wrong
(please make us wrong)
One hundred proof
Smelled the same as
Isopropyl

This room, how well I know it.
Now they’re renting it, and the one next to it,
as offices. The whole house has become
an office building for agents, businessmen, companies. 
This room, how familiar it is. 
The couch was here, near the door,
a Turkish carpet in front of it.
Close by, the shelf with two yellow vases.
On the right—no, opposite—a wardrobe with a mirror.
In the middle the table where he wrote,
and the three big wicker chairs.
Beside the window the bed
where we made love so many times. 
They must still be around somewhere, those old things. 
Beside the window the bed;
the afternoon sun used to touch half of it. 
. . . One afternoon at four o’clock we separated
for a week only. . . And then—
that week became forever.

Quick passage into  memory and behind  only blank spaces,  blue stain on pink  litmus or merely  known so closely  something falls away  receding from touch,  caught in the air  your fingers move,  agile water-fly  padding the surface  of what is seen  even among these  defractions, bent  pencil or warps  of a flat eye, the wide world circling.

She said: “I’m god and all
of this and that world and love
garbage and slaughter all the time
and spring once a year. Once a year
I like to love. You can adjust
to the discipline or not,
and your sacrificial act
called ‘Fruitfulness in Decay’
would be pleasing to me
as long as you did it with joy.
Otherwise, the prayer ‘Decay,
Ripe in the Fruitfulness’
will do if you have to despair.”  Prayer 
You know that girl of yours
I liked? The one with strong legs,
grey eyes, weak in the chest
but always bouncing around?
The one they call “The Laugh,”
“The Walk,” “That Cunt,” “The Brain,”
“Talker, Talker, Talker,” and
“The Iron Woman”? Well,
she’s gone, gone gone, gone
gone gone to someone else,
and now they say that she,
“My Good,” “My True,” “My Beautiful,”
is sick to her god-damned
stomach and rejects all
medication. What do you do
to your physical praisers that
they fall apart so fast
or leave me? She needs help now,
yours or that prick’s,
I don’t know which. 
“I have worked out
my best in belief
of the rule, ‘The best
for the best results
in love of the best,’
or, ‘To hell with it:
I am just god:
it’s not my problem.”’ 
I will sit out this passion
unreconciled, thanks: there are
too many voices. My visions
are not causal but final:
there’s no place to go to
but on. I’ll dance at the ends
of the white strings of nerves
and love for a while, your slave.
Oh stupid condition, I drink
to your Presences in hope of sleep
asleep, and continuity awake.


^^EOP^^

I realise it’s not all salad sandwiches
at pinewood picnics, endless volleyball.
I’ve heard the argument that talk of shame
and how our forebears thought their bodies dirty;
how we've all got one. Seen one, seen ’em all. 
But it’s not for me, beneath my double load
of Calvinist and voyeuristic tendencies.
For me, I have to see the clothes come off:
the way a button’s thumbed through cotton cloth -
a winning move in some exotic game 
with no set rules but countless permutations -
or how a summer dress falls to the floor
with momentary mass and with a plash
that stirs us briefly as we ply our passion;
a hand pushed through the coldness of a zip, 
three fingertips that follow down the spine
to where a clasp is neatly spun undone
amidkiss, by prime legerdemain
and who cares that it happens once in four
and never, never on the first undressing, 
it must be better than a foreskin snagged
on gorse thorns or a cold, fat nipple jammed
in the scissor drawer, the bounty and the blessing,
the mystery of nakedness reduced
till on a par with go-go palaces 
where goosebumped, grinding strippers strut their stuff
in the birthday clothes of backstreet empresses,
down on a par with the oncologist
who gropes for lumps, the night-morgue man who clips
his nails amongst the naked, bin-bagged stiffs. 
So, stranger, what I want to say is this:
if you’re to join me in a little sinning
(and this is my place up here on the right),
please understand I’d value some reluctance,
a cold-feet shiver, as in the beginning 
when Eve discovered modesty and slipped
in and out of something comfortable.
For there are many ways to skin a cat,
but ours is human nature - things come off
so rarely. Come in. Let me take your coat.


^^EOP^^

Who will you point to? In the needle's eye,
or selling what you won at the strait gate,
who will know how to kiss you and just when
to pull the hair at your neck and say your name?
No single victim will ever be the last.
Not, at least, until one victim purifies
the whole issue of suffering
by crying out that his pain means nothing
because it comes from nowhere and goes nowhere.
The clusters of exiles in their storefronts
will be free then. History will end.
Lover will take her hand from her lover's mouth
and see only his mouth, not a sightless
fish's eye scored onto the sheet's marble. 
It's a wise child who knows it is no angel.
The rest of us grow up hovering, visiting
our lives in the moment of pain or orgasm
or when the little fingers of pity push
inside us and we feel loved. Our suffering
gales beneath our wings like applause.
We long to repeat it, to explain it
to stay aloft and clear our lives in that
mid-heaven of nostalgia and apology.
We hover over the camps, the forced retreats,
the ends of nations that no one can recall now
except as code words for catastrophe.
We alight for pleasure, touching the victims
as the hurt husband touches the bed his wife has left. 
Father loved you with a passion. Or else
from fear of your long, inarticulate future,
he turned silent, edging into crank broadcasts
by a small radio on the screened porch.
Perhaps, as my father did, he moved out
into another house and had a daughter
with a redheaded woman who mistook his silence
for grief. My father never lost anything.
For years, I went to school with the daughter
as she grew fat and her red hair reached her knees.
Who were the victims? At what moment
should my father have cried out, the mothers
have cried out, or I have taken the fat hand
of my sister and walked off through the needle's eye? 
And it's a wise child who can understand
that the mothers and fathers on the trains
see only the receding pastorals,
the lamplit villages of other angels,
and that his suffering is only one pinpoint
on a lithic hoarding of departures
each passenger reads like an advertisement of heaven.
The wise child goes crazy. How could he not?
How could he not be heartbroken to learn
that even compassion is compassionless, that it uses
the real or imagined pain of others and himself
for wings, for memory, for a marriage proposal,
for the cruel angelism that adores victims
and makes a fifth, airier element out of pain? 
We recede. We recede. A virus finds
that place deepest behind the heart where it
unweaves itself into a pattern of false starts
like knots of villages and the one house
lightening at the crest of a green street
as its doors close to us. Dearest,
that is another crime of pluralism.
Hope, jagged with beginnings, scatters
our one real life among a dozen houses,
little illnesses of longing whose low
fevers contract the heart. You have but one heart.
And I have one. At the crest of a green street
we give them away. The night thanks us.
The fences shiver with cats, and the flowers close. 
Feeling comes from nowhere and goes nowhere.
It is not a train. It is not one instance
of lovemaking or a lifetime spent together
running the dogs, dying finally face down
in the yard bed of herbs. We are all the same.
Or, rather, we should believe we are the same
in order to be happy with the same things
and not to be stealing from each other.
We put each other in camps. I crush my lover with a kiss
and then it is impossible to love her.
What must die if we are to live without barbed wire
and bad sex is the very idea of otherness.
And to kill the idea, we have merely to find
one victim in ourselves who will die for nothing. 
My father could not stop getting children.
The people on the trains cannot stop watching
the passing villages for their own ghosts
and early angels. I cannot stop finding
houses in which to lose my heart a dozen times
in the fits and starts of a little passion exalted.
Life is not going to be bearable, I think,
for a long time. The exiles will play cards
in their storefront lodges. History will slide on.
And one will pull the hair at my neck. And one
will cover my mouth as she makes love to me.
The streets are snowed in under heaven's leaflets.
Our beds are scored with the sightless eyes, the eyes of others.
The air is sickeningly heavy with applause.


^^EOP^^

The age demanded that we sing And cut away our tongue.  The age demanded that we flow And hammered in the bung.  The age demanded that we dance And jammed us into iron pants.  And in the end the age was handed The sort of shit that it demanded.


^^EOP^^

I loathe that I did love,
  In youth that I thought sweet,As time requires for my behove,
  Methinks they are not meet.
My lusts they do me leave,
  My fancies all be fled,And tract of time begins to weave
  Grey hairs upon my head,
For age with stealing steps
  Hath clawed me with his crutch,And lusty life away she leaps
  As there had been none such.
My Muse doth not delight
  Me as she did before;My hand and pen are not in plight,
  As they have been of yore.
For reason me denies
  This youthly idle rhyme;And day by day to me she cries,
  “Leave off these toys in time.”
The wrinkles in my brow,
  The furrows in my face,Say, limping age will lodge him now
  Where youth must give him place.
The harbinger of death,
  To me I see him ride,The cough, the cold, the gasping breath
  Doth bid me provide
A pickaxe and a spade,
  And eke a shrouding sheet,A house of clay for to be made
  For such a guest most meet.
Methinks I hear the clark
  That knolls the careful knell,And bids me leave my woeful wark,
  Ere nature me compel.
My keepers knit the knot
  That youth did laugh to scorn,Of me that clean shall be forgot
  As I had not been born.
Thus must I youth give up,
  Whose badge I long did wear;To them I yield the wanton cup
  That better may it bear.
Lo, here the barèd skull,
  By whose bald sign I knowThat stooping age away shall pull
  Which youthful years did sow.
For beauty with her band
  These crooked cares hath wrought,And shippèd me into the land
  From whence I first was brought.
And ye that bide behind,
  Have ye none other trust:As ye of clay were cast by kind,
  So shall ye waste to dust.

Ah, ah cries the crow arching toward the heavy sky over the marina.
Lands on the crown of the palm tree. 
Ah, ah slaps the urgent cove of ocean swimming through the slips.
We carry canoes to the edge of the salt. 
Ah, ah groans the crew with the weight, the winds cutting skin.
We claim our seats. Pelicans perch in the draft for fish. 
Ah, ah beats our lungs and we are racing into the waves.
Though there are worlds below us and above us, we are straight ahead. 
Ah, ah tattoos the engines of your plane against the sky—away from these waters.
Each paddle stroke follows the curve from reach to loss. 
Ah, ah calls the sun from a fishing boat with a pale, yellow sail. We fly by
on our return, over the net of eternity thrown out for stars. 
Ah, ah scrapes the hull of my soul. Ah, ah.

Ah, silly Pug, wert thou so sore afraid?Mourn not, my Wat, nor be thou so dismayed.It passeth fickle Fortune’s power and skillTo force my heart to think thee any ill.No Fortune base, thou sayest, shall alter thee?And may so blind a witch so conquer me?No, no, my Pug, though Fortune were not blind,Assure thyself she could not rule my mind.Fortune, I know, sometimes doth conquer kings,And rules and reigns on earth and earthly things,But never think Fortune can bear the swayIf virtue watch, and will her not obey.Ne chose I thee by fickle Fortune’s rede,Ne she shall force me alter with such speedBut if to try this mistress’ jest with thee.Pull up thy heart, suppress thy brackish tears,Torment thee not, but put away thy fears.Dead to all joys and living unto woe,Slain quite by her that ne’er gave wise men blow,Revive again and live without all dread,The less afraid, the better thou shalt speed.

In the American schoolyard
where we lunged headfirst
onto the rocky ground scrab-
bling for a ball
                         as if
for love, the crossed chalk-
line still electrified our
tough boyish hearts, and no
one much cared
                      for such
exotic gods as loomed up
out of the Palatine Hills
in the required guidebooks
dumped in heaps
                        behind our
makeshift goal. We knew
what we knew. Sweatstains
darkened our blue school
shirts while
                   our fathers’
fighters strafed the mock-
ups in the practice fields,
never far enough from town
it didn’t thunder
                           all day
through the blackened
cottages’ stony stares locked
up tight behind their shot
bolts; nor through
                            the evening,
either, when drifting home,
stripped to the waist, we’d
dance feet-chalked across
the marketplace
                        like young,
uneasy gods, a little drunk
on our shame, our power.

This tuft that thrives on saline nothingness,
Inverted octopus with heavenward arms
Thrust parching from a palm-bole hard by the cove⎯
A bird almost⎯of almost bird alarms, 
Is pulmonary to the wind that jars
Its tentacles, horrific in their lurch.
The lizard’s throat, held bloated for a fly,
Balloons but warily from this throbbing perch. 
The needles and hack-saws of cactus bleed
A milk of earth when stricken off the stalk;
But this,⎯defenseless, thornless, sheds no blood,
Almost no shadow⎯but the air’s thin talk. 
Angelic Dynamo! Ventriloquist of the Blue!
While beachward creeps the shark-swept Spanish Main
By what conjunctions do the winds appoint
Its apotheosis, at last⎯the hurricane!

The glories of our blood and state Are shadows, not substantial things; There is no armor against fate; Death lays his icy hand on kings.     Scepter and crown     Must tumble down And in the dust be equal made With the poor crooked scythe and spade.  Some men with swords may reap the field And plant fresh laurels where they kill, But their strong nerves at last must yield; They tame but one another still.     Early or late     They stoop to fate And must give up their murmuring breath, When they, pale captives, creep to death.  The garlands wither on your brow, Then boast no more your mighty deeds; Upon death’s purple altar now See where the victor-victim bleeds.     Your heads must come     To the cold tomb; Only the actions of the just Smell sweet and blossom in their dust.

a blue-eyed Puerto Rican with people from Fajardo,

Praise the lighthouse in Fajardo, candle   
glimmering white to worship the dark saint of the sea.    Alabanza. Praise the cook’s yellow Pirates cap   
worn in the name of Roberto Clemente, his plane   
that flamed into the ocean loaded with cans for Nicaragua,   
for all the mouths chewing the ash of earthquakes.    Alabanza. Praise the kitchen radio, dial clicked   
even before the dial on the oven, so that music and Spanish   
rose before bread. Praise the bread. Alabanza. 
Praise Manhattan from a hundred and seven flights up,   
like Atlantis glimpsed through the windows of an ancient aquarium.   
Praise the great windows where immigrants from the kitchen   
could squint and almost see their world, hear the chant of nations:    Ecuador, México, Republica Dominicana,   
Haiti, Yemen, Ghana, Bangladesh.

Then I was sealed, and like the wintering tree
I stood me locked upon a summer core;
Living, had died a death, and asked no more.
And I lived then, but as enduringly,
And my heart beat, but only as to be.
Ill weathers well, hail, gust and cold I bore,
I held my life as hid, at root, in store:
Thus I lived then, till this air breathed on me.
Till this kind air breathed kindness everywhere,
There where my times had left me I would stay.
Then I was staunch, I knew nor yes nor no;
But now the wishful leaves have thronged the air.
My every leaf leans forth upon the day;
Alas, kind element! which comes to go.


^^EOP^^

Alas, so all things now do hold their peace!
   Heaven and earth disturbèd in no thing;
The beasts, the air, the birds their song do cease,
   The nightès car the stars about doth bring;
Calm is the sea; the waves work less and less:
   So am not I, whom love, alas! doth wring,
Bringing before my face the great increase
   Of my desires, whereat I weep and sing,
In joy and woe, as in a doubtful case.
   For my sweet thoughts sometime do pleasure bring:
But by and by, the cause of my disease
   Gives me a pang that inwardly doth sting,
When that I think what grief it is again
To live and lack the thing should rid my pain.   


^^EOP^^

You do look a little ill. 
But we can do something about that, now.    
Can’t we. 
The fact is you’re a shocking wreck.    
Do you hear me. 
You aren’t all alone. 
And you could use some help today, packing in the   
dark, boarding buses north, putting the seat back and   
grinning with terror flowing over your legs through   
your fingers and hair . . . 
I was always waiting, always here.    
Know anyone else who can say that. 
My advice to you is think of her for what she is:   
one more name cut in the scar of your tongue. 
What was it you said, “To rather be harmed than   
harm, is not abject.” 
Please. 
Can we be leaving now. 
We like bus trips, remember. Together 
we could watch these winter fields slip past, and   
never care again, 
think of it. 
I don’t have to be anywhere.

I sing the man that never equal knew, Whose mighty arms all Asia did subdue, Whose conquests through the spacious world do ring, That city-raser, king-destroying king, Who o’er the warlike Macedons did reign, And worthily the name of Great did gain. This is the prince (if fame you will believe, To ancient story any credit give.) Who when the globe of Earth he had subdued, With tears the easy victory pursued; Because that no more worlds there were to win, No further scene to act his glories in.      Ah that some pitying Muse would now inspire My frozen style with a poetic fire, And raptures worthy of his matchless fame, Whose deeds I sing, whose never fading name Long as the world shall fresh and deathless last, No less to future ages, then the past. Great my presumption is, I must confess, But if I thrive, my glory’s ne’er the less; Nor will it from his conquests derogate A female pen his acts did celebrate. If thou O Muse wilt thy assistance give, Such as made Naso and great Maro live, With him whom Melas’ fertile banks did bear, Live, though their bodies dust and ashes are; Whose laurels were not fresher, than their fame Is now, and will for ever be the same. If the like favor thou wilt grant to me, O Queen of Verse, I’ll not ungrateful be, My choicest hours to thee I’ll dedicate, ’Tis thou shalt rule, ’tis thou shalt be my fate. But if coy goddess thou shalt this deny, And from my humble suit disdaining fly, I’ll stoop and beg no more, since I know this, Writing of him, I cannot write amiss: His lofty deeds will raise each feeble line, And god-like acts will make my verse divine.     ’Twas at the time the golden sun doth rise, And with his beams enlights the azure skies, When lo a troop in silver arms drew near, The glorious sun did nere so bright appear; Dire scarlet plumes adorned their haughty crests, And crescent shields did shade their shining breasts; Down from their shoulders hung a panther’s hide, A bow and quiver rattled by their side; Their hands a knotty well tried spear did bear, Jocund they seemed, and quite devoid of fear. These warlike virgins were, that do reside   Near Thermodon’s smooth banks and verdant side, The plains of Themiscyre their birth do boast, Thalestris now did head the beauteous host; She emulating that illustrious dame, Who to the aid of Troy and Priam came, And her who the Retulian prince did aid, Though dearly both for their assistance paid. But fear she scorned, nor the like fate did dread, Her host she often to the field had led, As oft in triumph had returned again, Glory she only sought for all her pain.     This martial queen had heard how loudly fame, Echoed our conqueror’s redoubted name, Her soul his conduct and his courage fired, To see the hero she so much admired; And to Hyrcania for this cause she went, Where Alexander (wholly then intent On triumphs and such military sport) At truce with war held both his camp and court. And while before the town she did attend Her messengers return, she saw ascend A cloud of dust, that covered all the sky, And still at every pause there stroke her eye. The interrupted beams of burnished gold, As dust the splendor hid, or did unfold; Loud neighings of the steeds, and trumpets’ sound Filled all the air, and echoed from the ground; The gallant Greeks with a brisk march drew near, And their great chief did at their head appear. And now come up to th’Amazonian band, They made a halt and a respectful stand: And both the troops (with like amazement strook) Did each on other with deep silence look. Th’heroic queen (whose high pretence to war Cancelled the bashful laws and nicer bar Of modesty, which did her sex restrain) First boldly did advance before her train, And thus she spake. All but a god in name, And that a debt time owes unto thy fame.           This was the first essay of this young lady in          poetry, but finding the task she had undertaken          hard, she laid it by till practice and more time          should make her equal to so great a work.

Even now this landscape is assembling.
The hills darken. The oxen
sleep in their blue yoke,
the fields having been
picked clean, the sheaves
bound evenly and piled at the roadside
among cinquefoil, as the toothed moon rises: 
This is the barrenness
of harvest or pestilence.
And the wife leaning out the window
with her hand extended, as in payment,
and the seeds
distinct, gold, calling Come here
Come here, little one

A few of us—Hillary Clinton, Vlad Dracula,   
Oprah Winfrey, and Trotsky—peer through   
the kitchen window at a raccoon perched   
outside on a picnic table where it picks 
over chips, veggies, olives, and a chunk of pâte.   
Behind us others crowd the hallway, many more
dance in the living room. Trotsky fusses with the bloody   
screwdriver puttied to her forehead. 
Hillary Clinton, whose voice is the rumble
of a bowling ball, whose hands are hairy
to the third knuckle, lifts his rubber chin to announce,   
“What a perfect mask it has!” While the Count 
whistling through his plastic fangs says, “Oh,   
and a nose like a chef.” Then one by one   
the other masks join in: “Tail of a gambler,”   
“a swashbuckler’s hips,” “feet of a cat burglar.” 
Trotsky scratches herself beneath her skirt
and Hillary, whose lederhosen are so tight they form a codpiece,   
wraps his legs around Trotsky’s leg and humps like a dog.   
Dracula and Oprah, the married hosts, hold hands 
and then let go. Meanwhile the raccoon squats on   
the gherkins, extracts pimentos from olives, and sniffs   
abandoned cups of beer. A ghoul in the living room   
turns the music up and the house becomes a drum. 
The windows buzz. “Who do you love? Who do you love?”   
the singer sings. Our feathered arms, our stockinged legs.   
The intricate paws, the filleting tongue.
We love what we are; we love what we’ve become.

The dogs eat hoof slivers and lie under the porch.
A strand of human hair hangs strangely from a fruit tree
like a cry in the throat. The sky is clay for the child who is past
being tired, who wanders in waist-deep
grasses. Gnats rise in a vapor,
in a long mounting whine around her forehead and ears. 
The sun is an indistinct moon. Frail sticks
of grass poke her ankles,
and a wet froth of spiders touches her legs
like wet fingers. The musk and smell
of air are as hot as the savory
terrible exhales from a tired horse. 
The parents are sleeping all afternoon,
and no one explains the long uneasy afternoons.
She hears their combined breathing and swallowing
salivas, and sees their sides rising and falling
like the sides of horses in the hot pasture. 
At evening a breeze dries and crumbles
the sky and the clouds float like undershirts
and cotton dresses on a clothesline. Horses
rock to their feet and race or graze.
Parents open their shutters and call
the lonely, happy child home.
The child who hates silences talks and talks
of cicadas and the manes of horses.

In the chill rains of the early winter I hear something—
A puling anger, a cold wind stiffened by flying bone—
Out of the north ...
and remember, then, what’s up there:
That ghost-bank: home: Amchitka: boot hill .... 
They must be very tired, those ghosts; no flesh sustains them
And the bones rust in the rain.
Reluctant to go into the earth
The skulls gleam: wet; the dog-tag forgets the name;
The statistics (wherein they were young) like their crosses, are weathering out, 
They must be very tired.
But I see them riding home,
Nightly: crying weak lust and rage: to stand in the dark,
Forlorn in known rooms, unheard near familiar beds:
Where lie the aging women: who were so lovely: once.

Think of a self-effacing missionary
Tending the vices of a problem tribe.
He knows the quickest cure for beri-beri
And how to take a bribe. 
And so the mind will never say it’s beaten
By primitive disturbance of the liver;
Its logic will prevent its being eaten,
Get it across the river. 
But faced with this assured inconsequence
That damns the very method that is used,
It leaves the heart unproselytised and hence
Admits that it’s confused. 
I know I’m acting, but I still must act.
I melt to foolishness, and want it ended.
Why it continues is this simple fact:
I’d hate to end it. 
For now the jungle moods assert their terms
And there’s no way to check them if they lie:
The mind attempts to solve the thing, but squirms
And knows exactly why. 
The world is everything that is the case.
You cannot see it if you are inside it.
That’s why the tortoise always wins the race:
the very terms decide it. 
I cannot help it if I am contented
With being discontented that I falter:
That’s why psychology was first invented
So that we needn’t alter. 
It is a strange position to be in.
It would be different if I didn’t know
Why the unlikely animal should win,
Which cannibal should row. 
You’d think there’d be a way of cutting out
Those self-destructive layers of introspection.
To reach the truth at last without a doubt
Of making the connection. 
That’s why the missionary, on his guard,
Is wondering why the cannibal’s so merry,
And why it is so very very hard
To be a missionary.

Imagine a big room of women doing anything,

the loud and quiet murmur of their voices,
women leaning their heads together. If we

The Visconti put you on their flag: a snake
devouring a child, or are you throwing up a man
feet first? Some snakes hunt frogs, some freedom of will.
There’s good in you: a man can count years on your skin.
Generously, you mother and father a stolen boy,
to the chosen you offer your cake of figs.
A goiter on my neck, you lick my ear with lies,
yet I must listen, smile and kiss your cheek
or you may swallow the child completely. In Milan
there is a triptych, the throned Virgin in glory,
placed on the marble below, a dead naked man
and a giant dead frog of human scale on its back.
There’s hope! My eyes look into the top of my head
at the wreath of snakes that sometimes crowns me.

The slight white poet would assume non-human forms, homely   
Grampus fish, a wahoo, nuthatch, nit. 
                                                      He had no romance except   
Remorse, which he used like fuzzy algebra. By pouring bluing 
On black porous coal, he crystallized, pronounced himself almost   
A sorcerer. He had an empty cloakroom 
                                                      In the chest of him.
                                                      All the lost wool scarves 
Of all the world collected there & muffled him   
                                                      With wool. 
He imagined he could move a broom if he desired, just by wishing   
It. If he spoke of ghosts, he thought he could make of art vast 
                                                      Tattersall & spreading wings.   
When they found him in the nurse’s office, 
He was awkward as a charlatan, slightly queasy
                                                      In an emperor’s real clothes. 
The thermos in his lunchbox was perpetually   
Broken and he lied. The small world smelled of oil 
Of peppermint, for a broken spell. Everything is plaid
                                                      And sour in oblivion, as well.

From childhood’s hour I have not been As others were—I have not seen As others saw—I could not bring My passions from a common spring— From the same source I have not taken My sorrow—I could not awaken My heart to joy at the same tone— And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone— Then—in my childhood—in the dawn Of a most stormy life—was drawn From ev’ry depth of good and ill The mystery which binds me still— From the torrent, or the fountain— From the red cliff of the mountain— From the sun that ’round me roll’d In its autumn tint of gold— From the lightning in the sky As it pass’d me flying by— From the thunder, and the storm— And the cloud that took the form (When the rest of Heaven was blue) Of a demon in my view—

A porcupine skin, Stiff with bad tanning, It must have ended somewhere. Stuffed horned owl Pompous Yellow eyed; Chuck-wills-widow on a biassed twig Sooted with dust. Piles of old magazines, Drawers of boy’s letters And the line of love They must have ended somewhere. Yesterday’s Tribune is gone Along with youth And the canoe that went to pieces on the beach The year of the big storm When the hotel burned down At Seney, Michigan.

There was a church in Umbria, Little Portion,
Already old eight hundred years ago.
It was abandoned and in disrepair
But it was called St. Mary of the Angels
For it was known to be the haunt of angels,
Often at night the country people
Could hear them singing there. 
What was it like, to listen to the angels,
To hear those mountain-fresh, those simple voices
Poured out on the bare stones of Little Portion
In hymns of joy?
No one has told us.
Perhaps it needs another language
That we have still to learn,
An altogether different language.

Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,
And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,
Stealing my breath of life, I will confess
I love this cultured hell that tests my youth.
Her vigor flows like tides into my blood,
Giving me strength erect against her hate,
Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.
Yet, as a rebel fronts a king in state,
I stand within her walls with not a shred
Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer.
Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,
And see her might and granite wonders there,
Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand,
Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand.

America I’ve given you all and now I’m nothing.
America two dollars and twentyseven cents January 17, 1956.   
I can’t stand my own mind.
America when will we end the human war?
Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb.
I don’t feel good don’t bother me.
I won’t write my poem till I’m in my right mind.
America when will you be angelic?
When will you take off your clothes?
When will you look at yourself through the grave?
When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites?
America why are your libraries full of tears?
America when will you send your eggs to India?
I’m sick of your insane demands.
When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks?
America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world.   
Your machinery is too much for me.
You made me want to be a saint.
There must be some other way to settle this argument.   
Burroughs is in Tangiers I don’t think he’ll come back it’s sinister.   
Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke?   
I’m trying to come to the point.
I refuse to give up my obsession.
America stop pushing I know what I’m doing.
America the plum blossoms are falling.
I haven’t read the newspapers for months, everyday somebody goes on trial for murder.
America I feel sentimental about the Wobblies.
America I used to be a communist when I was a kid I’m not sorry.   
I smoke marijuana every chance I get.
I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet.   
When I go to Chinatown I get drunk and never get laid.   
My mind is made up there’s going to be trouble.
You should have seen me reading Marx.
My psychoanalyst thinks I’m perfectly right.
I won’t say the Lord’s Prayer.
I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations.
America I still haven’t told you what you did to Uncle Max after he came over from Russia.
I’m addressing you.
Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine?   
I’m obsessed by Time Magazine.
I read it every week.
Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore.   
I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library.
It’s always telling me about responsibility. Businessmen are serious. Movie producers are serious. Everybody’s serious but me.   
It occurs to me that I am America.
I am talking to myself again. 
Asia is rising against me.
I haven’t got a chinaman’s chance.
I’d better consider my national resources.
My national resources consist of two joints of marijuana millions of genitals an unpublishable private literature that jetplanes 1400 miles an hour and twentyfive-thousand mental institutions.
I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underprivileged who live in my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns.
I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to go.
My ambition is to be President despite the fact that I’m a Catholic. 
America how can I write a holy litany in your silly mood?
I will continue like Henry Ford my strophes are as individual as his automobiles more so they’re all different sexes.
America I will sell you strophes $2500 apiece $500 down on your old strophe
America free Tom Mooney
America save the Spanish Loyalists
America Sacco & Vanzetti must not die
America I am the Scottsboro boys.
America when I was seven momma took me to Communist Cell meetings they sold us garbanzos a handful per ticket a ticket costs a nickel and the speeches were free everybody was angelic and sentimental about the workers it was all so sincere you have no idea what a good thing the party was in 1835 Scott Nearing was a grand old man a real mensch Mother Bloor the Silk-strikers’ Ewig-Weibliche made me cry I once saw the Yiddish orator Israel Amter plain. Everybody must have been a spy.
America you don’t really want to go to war.
America its them bad Russians.
Them Russians them Russians and them Chinamen. And them Russians.   
The Russia wants to eat us alive. The Russia’s power mad. She wants to take our cars from out our garages.
Her wants to grab Chicago. Her needs a Red Reader’s Digest. Her wants our auto plants in Siberia. Him big bureaucracy running our fillingstations.
That no good. Ugh. Him make Indians learn read. Him need big black niggers. Hah. Her make us all work sixteen hours a day. Help.   
America this is quite serious.
America this is the impression I get from looking in the television set.   
America is this correct?
I’d better get right down to the job.
It’s true I don’t want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision parts factories, I’m nearsighted and psychopathic anyway.
America I’m putting my queer shoulder to the wheel.

O this political air so heavy with the bells
and motors of a slow night, and no place to rest
but rain to walk—How it rings the Washington streets!   
The umbrella’d congressmen; the rapping tires   
of big black cars, the shoulders of lobbyists   
caught under canopies and in doorways,
and it rains, it will not let up,
and meanwhile lame futurists weep into Spengler’s   
prophecy, will the world be over before the races blend color?
All color must be one or let the world be done—
There’ll be a chance, we’ll all be orange!
I don’t want to be orange!
Nothing about God’s color to complain;
and there is a beauty in yellow, the old Lama   
in his robe the color of Cathay;
in black a strong & vital beauty,
Thelonious Monk in his robe of Norman charcoal—
And if Western Civilization comes to an end   
(though I doubt it, for the prophet has not   
executed his prophecy) surely the Eastern child   
will sit by a window, and wonder
the old statues, the ornamented doors;
the decorated banquet of the West—
Inflamed by futurists I too weep in rain at night   
at the midnight of Western Civilization;
Dante’s step into Hell will never be forgotten by Hell;
the Gods’ adoption of Homer will never be forgotten by the Gods;
the books of France are on God’s bookshelf;
no civil war will take place on the fields of God;   
and I don’t doubt the egg of the East its glory—
Yet it rains and the motors go
and continued when I slept by that wall in Washington   
which separated the motors in the death-parlor   
where Joe McCarthy lay, lean and stilled,   
ten blocks from the Capitol—
I could never understand Uncle Sam
his red & white striped pants his funny whiskers his starry hat:
how surreal Yankee Doodle Dandy, goof!   
American history has a way of making you feel   
George Washington is still around, that is
when I think of Washington I do not think of Death—
Of all Presidents I have been under
Hoover is the most unreal
and FDR is the most President-looking
and Truman the most Jewish-looking
and Eisenhower the miscast of Time into Space—
Hoover is another America, Mr. 1930
and what must he be thinking now?
FDR was my youth, and how strange to still see   
his wife around.
Truman is still in Presidential time.
I saw Eisenhower helicopter over Athens
and he looked at the Acropolis like only Zeus could.   
OF THE PEOPLE is fortunate and select.
FOR THE PEOPLE has never happened in America or elsewhere.
BY THE PEOPLE is the sadness of America.   
I am not politic.
I am not patriotic.
I am nationalistic!
I boast well the beauty of America to all the people in Europe.
In me they do not see their vision of America.
O whenever I pass an American Embassy I don’t know what to feel!
Sometimes I want to rush in and scream: “I’m American!”   
but instead go a few paces down to the American Bar   
get drunk and cry: “I’m no American!”
The men of politics I love are but youth’s fantasy:
The fine profile of Washington on coins stamps & tobacco wraps
The handsomeness and death-in-the-snow of Hamilton.   
The eyeglasses shoe-buckles kites & keys of Ben Franklin.   
The sweet melancholy of Lincoln.
The way I see Christ, as something romantic & unreal, is the way I see them.
An American is unique among peoples.
He looks and acts like a boyman.
He never looks cruel in uniform.
He is rednecked portly rich and jolly.
White-haired serious Harvard, kind and wry.
A convention man a family man a rotary man & practical joker.
He is moonfaced cunning well-meaning & righteously mean.   
He is Madison Avenue, handsome, in-the-know, and superstitious.
He is odd, happy, quicker than light, shameless, and heroic   
Great yawn of youth!
The young don’t seem interested in politics anymore.   
Politics has lost its romance!
The “bloody kitchen” has drowned!
And all that is left are those granite
façades of Pentagon, Justice, and Department—
Politicians do not know youth!
They depend on the old
and the old depend on them
and lo! this has given youth a chance
to think of heaven in their independence.
No need to give them liberty or freedom
where they’re at—
When Stevenson in 1956 came to San Francisco
he campaigned in what he thought was an Italian section!   
He spoke of Italy and Joe DiMaggio and spaghetti,   
but all who were there, all for him,
were young beatniks! and when his car drove off
Ginsberg & I ran up to him and yelled:
“When are you going to free the poets from their attics!”   
Great yawn of youth!
Mad beautiful oldyoung America has no candidate   
the craziest wildest greatest country of them all!   
and not one candidate—
Nixon arrives ever so temporal, self-made,
frontways sideways and backways,
could he be America’s against? Detour to vehicle?   
Mast to wind? Shore to sea? Death to life?
The last President?

1    Kinship:
      Is embarrassing the wind,
      Like dead black boys,
      Falling down from the trees,
      Then downstream–
      On their knees,
      Blood like,
      Like a rich nation. 
2    Metaphor:
      Becomes humiliating,
      And clean,
      Ticking like a ripe machine.
      Do not
      Bend,
      Fold,
      Or mutilate me–
      This is your future speaking. 
3    The air smells so metaphysical
      We have accused it–
      Of smog,
      And lost manhood,
      Then all ritual. 
4    Whoever wrote:
      A view is a mountain speaking
      But left the introduction
      For the snow,
      And accused silence
      Of its soul. 
5    The whole nation:
      Is a stanza of blackness,
      A huge white whale,
      Faith in space
      (Like the newspapers),
      And the quiet insistence
      We have peace,
      And it’s your world, brother.

It is a time in which no man is extremely wondrous   
It is a time in which rock stupidity
         outsteps the 5th Column as the sole enemy in America
It is a time in which ignorance is a good Ameri-cun   
         ignorance is excused only where it is so   
         it is not so in America
Man is not guilty   Christ is not to be feared
I am telling you the American Way is a hideous monster   
         eating Christ   making Him into Oreos and Dr. Pepper   
         the sacrament of its foul mouth
I am telling you the devil is impersonating Christ in America   
America’s educators & preachers are the mental-dictators
         of false intelligence   they will not allow America
         to be smart
         they will only allow death to make America smart   
Educators & communicators are the lackeys of the   
         American Way
They enslave the minds of the young
         and the young are willing slaves (but not for long)   
         because who is to doubt the American Way   
         is not the way?
The duty of these educators is no different   
         than the duty of a factory foreman
Replica production   make all the young think alike   
         dress alike   believe alike   do alike
Togetherness   this is the American Way
The few great educators in America are weak & helpless   
They abide   and so uphold the American Way
Wars have seen such men   they who despised things about
         them
         but did nothing   and they are the most dangerous   
Dangerous because their intelligence is not denied   
         and so give faith to the young
         who rightfully believe in their intelligence   
Smoke this cigarette doctors smoke this cigarette   
         and doctors know 
Educators know   but they dare not speak their know   
The victory that is man is made sad in this fix   
Youth can only know the victory of being born
         all else is stemmed   until death be the final victory
         and a merciful one at that
If America falls it will be the blame of its educators   
         preachers   communicators   alike
America today is America’s greatest threat
We are old when we are young
America is always new   the world is always new   
The meaning of the world is birth not death
Growth gone in the wrong direction
The true direction grows ever young
In this direction what grows grows old
A strange mistake   a strange and sad mistake   
         for it has grown into an old thing
         while all else around it is new
Rockets will not make it any younger—
And what made America decide to grow?
I do not know   I can only hold it to the strangeness in man   
And America has grown into the American Way—
To be young is to be ever purposeful   limitless   
To grow is to know limit   purposelessness
Each age is a new age
How outrageous it is that something old and sad
         from the pre-age incorporates each new age—
Do I say the Declaration of Independence is old?
Yes I say what was good for 1789, is not good for 1960   
It was right and new to say all men were created equal
         because it was a light then
But today it is tragic to say it
         today it should be fact—
Man has been on earth a long time
One would think with his mania for growth
         he would, by now, have outgrown such things as   
         constitutions manifestos codes commandments   
         that he could well live in the world without them   
         and know instinctively how to live and be   
         —for what is being but the facility to love?
Was not that the true goal of growth, love?
Was not that Christ?
But man is strange and grows where he will
         and chalks it all up to Fate   whatever be—
America rings with such strangeness
It has grown into something strange and
         the American is good example of this mad growth   
The boy man   big baby meat
         as though the womb were turned backwards   
         giving birth to an old man
The victory that is man does not allow man
         to top off his empirical achievement with death   
The Aztecs did it by yanking out young hearts
         at the height of their power
The Americans are doing it by feeding their young to the   
         Way
For it was not the Spaniard who killed the Aztec
         but the Aztec who killed the Aztec
Rome is proof   Greece is proof   all history is proof   
Victory does not allow degeneracy
It will not be the Communists will kill America
         no   but America itself—
The American Way   that sad mad process
         is not run by any one man or organization   
It is a monster born of itself   existing of its self
The men who are employed by this monster
         are employed unknowingly
They reside in the higher echelons of intelligence   
They are the educators the psychiatrists the ministers
         the writers the politicians the communicators
         the rich the entertainment world
And some follow and sing the Way because they sincerely   
         believe it to be good
And some believe it holy and become minutemen in it   
Some are in it simply to be in
And most are in it for gold
They do not see the Way as monster
They see it as the “Good Life”
What is the Way?
The Way was born out of the American Dream   
         a nightmare—
The state of Americans today compared to the Americans   
         of the 18th century proves the nightmare—
Not Franklin not Jefferson who speaks for America today   
         but strange red-necked men of industry   
         and the goofs of show business
Bizarre! Frightening! The Mickey Mouse sits on the throne   
         and Hollywood has a vast supply—
Could grammar school youth seriously look upon
         a picture of George Washington and “Herman Borst”   
         the famous night club comedian together at Valley   
         Forge?
Old old and decadent   gone the dignity
         the American sun seems headed for the grave
O that youth might raise it anew!
The future depends solely on the young   
The future is the property of the young   
What the young know the future will know   
What they are and do the future will be and do   
What has been done must not be done again   
Will the American Way allow this?   
No.
I see in every American Express
         and in every army center in Europe
         I see the same face the same sound of voice
         the same clothes the same walk   
I see mothers & fathers
         no difference among them
Replicas
They not only speak and walk and think alike   
         they have the same face!
What did this monstrous thing?
What regiments a people so?
How strange is nature’s play on America   
Surely were Lincoln alive today
         he could never be voted President   not with his   
         looks—
Indeed Americans are babies all in the embrace
         of Mama Way
Did not Ike, when he visited the American Embassy in
         Paris a year ago, say to the staff—“Everything is fine,   
         just drink Coca Cola, and everything will be all right.”   
         This is true, and is on record
Did not American advertising call for TOGETHERNESS?   
         not orgiasticly like today’s call   
         nor as means to stem violence   
         This is true, and is on record.
Are not the army centers in Europe ghettos?   
         They are, and O how sad   how lost!
The PX newsstands are filled with comic books
The army movies are always Doris Day   
What makes a people huddle so?   
Why can’t they be universal?
Who has smalled them so?
This is serious! I do not mock or hate this
         I can only sense some mad vast conspiracy!   
Helplessness is all it is!
They are caught   caught in the Way—
And those who seek to get out of the Way   
         can not
The Beats are good example of this   
They forsake the Way’s habits
         and acquire for themselves their own habits
And they become as distinct and regimented and lost
         as the main flow
         because the Way has many outlets
         like a snake of many tentacles—
There is no getting out of the Way
The only way out is the death of the Way
And what will kill the Way but a new consciousness   
Something great and new and wonderful must happen
         to free man from this beast
It is a beast we can not see or even understand
For it be the condition of our minds
God how close to science fiction it all seems!
As if some power from another planet
         incorporated itself in the minds of us all
It could well be!
For as I live I swear America does not seem like America   
         to me 
Americans are a great people
I ask for some great and wondrous event
         that will free them from the Way
         and make them a glorious purposeful people once   
         again
I do not know if that event is due   deserved
         or even possible
I can only hold that man is the victory of life
And I hold firm to American man 
I see standing on the skin of the Way
         America   to be as proud and victorious as St.   
         Michael on the neck of the fallen Lucifer—

1AMETAS Think’st thou that this love can stand, Whilst thou still dost say me nay? Love unpaid does soon disband: Love binds love as hay binds hay.
2THESTYLIS Think’st thou that this rope would twine If we both should turn one way?Where both parties so combine,Neither love will twist nor hay.
3AMETAS Thus you vain excuses find, Which yourselves and us delay: And love ties a woman’s mind Looser than with ropes of hay.
4THESTYLIS What you cannot constant hope Must be taken as you may.
5AMETAS Then let’s both lay by our rope, And go kiss within the hay.

Happy ye leaves when as those lilly hands,
Which hold my life in their dead doing might
Shall handle you and hold in loves soft bands,
Lyke captives trembling at the victors sight.
And happy lines, on which with starry light,
Those lamping eyes will deigne sometimes to look
And reade the sorrowes of my dying spright,
Written with teares in harts close bleeding book.
And happy rymes bath’d in the sacred brooke,
Of Helicon whence she derived is,
When ye behold that Angels blessed looke,
My soules long lacked foode, my heavens blis.
Leaves, lines, and rymes, seeke her to please alone,
Whom if ye please, I care for other none.

New yeare forth looking out of Janus gate,Doth seeme to promise hope of new delight:And bidding th’old Adieu, his pass


^^EOP^^

Of this worlds Theatre in which we stay,My love lyke the Spectator ydly sitsBeholding me that all the pageants play,Disguysing diversly my troubled wits.Sometimes I joy when glad occasion fits,And mask in myrth lyke to a Comedy:Soone after when my joy to sorrow flits,I waile and make my woes a Tragedy.Yet she beholding me with constant eye,Delights not in my merth nor rues my smart:But when I laugh she mocks, and when I cryShe laughes, and hardens evermore her hart.What then can move her? if not merth nor mone,She is no woman, but a sencelesse stone. 


^^EOP^^

So oft as I her beauty do behold,And therewith do her cruelty compare,I marvel of what substance was the mouldThe which her made at once so cruel-fair.Not earth; for her high thoughts more heavenly are:Not water; for her love doth burn like fire:Not air; for she is not so light or rare:Not fire; for she doth freeze with faint desire.
Then needs another element inquireWhereof she might be made; that is, the sky.For to the heaven her haughty looks aspire,And eke her love is pure immortal high.
 Then since to heaven ye likened are the best,
 Be like in mercy as in all the rest. 



^^EOP^^

The weary yeare his race now having run, The new begins his compast course anew: With shew of morning mylde he hath begun, Betokening peace and plenty to ensew.So let us, which this chaunge of weather vew, Chaunge eeke our mynds and former lives amend,The old yeares sinnes forepast let us eschew, And fly the faults with which we did offend. Then shall the new yeares joy forth freshly send, Into the glooming world his gladsome ray: And all these stormes which now his beauty blend, Shall turne to caulmes and tymely cleare away. So likewise love cheare you your heavy spright, And chaunge old yeares annoy to new delight.


^^EOP^^

To all those happy blessings which ye have, With plenteous hand by heaven upon you thrown: This one disparagement they to you gave, That ye your love lent to so meane a one. Yee whose high worths surpassing paragon, Could not on earth have found one fit for mate, Ne but in heaven matchable to none, Why did ye stoup unto so lowly state. But ye thereby much greater glory gate, Then had ye sorted with a princes pere: For now your light doth more it selfe dilate, And in my darknesse greater doth appeare. Yet since your light hath once enlumind me, With my reflex yours shall encreased be.

Fresh spring the herald of loves mighty king,In whose cote armour richly are displayedAll sorts of flowers the which on earth do spring In goodly colours gloriously arrayd:Goe to my love, where she is carelesse layd,Yet in her winters bowre not well awake:Tell her the joyous time wil not be staidUnless she doe him by the forelock take.Bid her therefore her selfe soone ready make,To wayt on love amongst his lovely crew:Where every one that misseth then her make,Shall be by him amearst with penance dew.Make hast therefore sweet love, whilest it is prime,For none can call againe the passèd time.


^^EOP^^

I joy to see how in your drawen work,Your selfe unto the Bee ye doe compare;And me unto the Spyder that doth lurke,In close awayt to catch her unaware.Right so your selfe were caught in cunning snareOf a deare for, and thralled to his love:In whose streight bands ye now captived areSo firmely, that ye never may remove.But as your whole worke is woven all about,With woodbynd flowers and fragrant Enlantine:So sweet your prison you in time shall prove,With many deare delights bedecked fyne,And all thensforth eternall peace shall see Betweene the Spyder and the gentle Bee.


^^EOP^^

Fayre is my love, when her fayre golden heares,With the loose wynd ye waving chance to marke:Fayre when the rose in her red cheekes appears,Or in her eyes the fyre of love does sparke.Fayre when her brest lyke a rich laden barke,With pretious merchandize she forth doth lay:Fayre when that cloud of pryde which oft doth dark Her goodly light with smiles she drives away,But fayrest she, when so she doth displayThe gate with pearles and rubyes richly dight:Throgh which her words so wise do make their wayTo beare the message of her gentle spright.The rest be works of natures wonderment,But this the worke of harts astonishment.


^^EOP^^

Lyke as the Culver on the barèd bough,Sits mourning for the absence of her mate:And in her songs sends many a wishfull vow,For his returne that seemes to linger late,So I alone now left disconsolate,Mourne to my selfe the absence of my love:And wandring here and there all desolate,Seek with my playnts to match that mournful dove:Ne joy of ought that under heaven doth hove,Can comfort me, but her owne joyous sight:Whose sweet aspèct both God and man can move,In her unspotted pleasauns to delight.Dark is my day, whyles her fayre light I mis,And dead my life that wants such lively blis.


^^EOP^^

More then most faire, full of the living fire,Kindled above unto the maker neere:No eies but joyes, in which al powers conspire,That to the world naught else be counted deare.Thrugh your bright beams doth not the blinded guestShoot out his darts to base affections wound?But Angels come to lead fraile mindes to restIn chast desires on heavenly beauty bound.You frame my thoughts and fashion me within,You stop my toung, and teach my hart to speake,You calme the storme that passion did begin,Strong thrugh your cause, but by your vertue weak.Dark is the world, where your light shined never;Well is he borne, that may behold you ever.


^^EOP^^

In that proud port, which her so goodly graceth, Whiles her faire face she reares up to the skie: And to the ground her eie lids low embaseth Most goodly temperature ye may descry, Myld humblesse mixt with awfull majesty, For looking on the earth whence she was borne: Her minde remembreth her mortalitie, What so is fayrest shall to earth returne. But that same lofty countenance seemes to scorne Base thing, and thinke how she to heaven may clime: Treading downe earth as lothsome and forlorne, That hinders heavenly thoughts with drossy slime. Yet lowly still vouchsafe to looke on me, Such lowlinesse shall make you lofty be.

Ye tradefull Merchants that with weary toyle, Do seeke most pretious things to make your gain: And both the Indias of their treasures spoile, What needeth you to seeke so farre in vaine? For loe my love doth in her selfe containe All this worlds riches that may farre be found, If Saphyres, loe hir eies be Saphyres plaine, If Rubies, loe hir lips be Rubies sound: If Pearles, hir teeth be pearles both pure and round; If Yvorie, her forhead yvory weene; If Gold, her locks are finest gold on ground; If silver, her faire hands are silver sheene; But that which fairest is, but few behold, Her mind adornd with vertues manifold.

Penelope for her Ulisses sake,
Deviz’d a Web her wooers to deceave:
In which the worke that she all day did make
The same at night she did again unreave:
Such subtile craft my Damzell doth conceave,
Th’ importune suit of my desire to shonne:
For all that I in many dayes doo weave,
In one short houre I find by her undonne.
So when I thinke to end that I begonne,
I must begin and never bring to end:
For with one looke she spils that long I sponne,
And with one word my whole years work doth rend.
Such labour like the Spyders web I fynd,
Whose fruitless worke is broken with least wynd.

My Love is like to ice, and I to fire:How comes it then that this her cold so greatIs not dissolved through my so hot desire,But harder grows the more I her entreat?Or how comes it that my exceeding heatIs not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,And feel my flames augmented manifold?What more miraculous thing may be told,That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,And ice, which is congeal’d with senseless cold,Should kindle fire by wonderful device?
 Such is the power of love in gentle mind,
 That it can alter all the course of kind.

‘He thought it had only been put there
to finish off th’ alphabet, like, though
ampus-and (&) would ha’ done as well.’
(George Eliot: Adam Bede)



And had in fact, for generations—
the plump, open armed ‘&’ waving goodbye
from the end of the old-world alphabet
like an innkeeper framed in doorway candlelight,
farewells swelled with hopes of come again. 
Then the old world burned down
because we sensed, beyond the candle’s glow,
the road led to a dead end. No
traveler returned, even the unverified
odd reports of happy returns petered out. 
So we renovated the alphabet, signing it
off with a streamlined ‘z’ as sharp
and final as lightning: no sense
in posting notice of further connections
that didn’t exist, or passing off maps as places. 
Trouble was, nobody felt at home
in the revamped compound. Bookings fell off,
postcards of views of blank walls piled unsold
in the unvisited gift shop, the same
paperbacks stalled on the revolving racks. 
It was a paradise of sorts, a golden age
of nullity, no relatives
breaking the costly silence. No wonder Eliot’s
befuddled Jacob Storey felt his page
of Z’s was somehow ‘not right,’ that 
‘it was a letter you never wanted hardly.’
He knew, as one newly released from the unlit
cell of his long-unlettered ignorance,
what you did want hardly: you wanted,
needed—as hardly as Hetty Sorrel, 
abandoned at the dock—someone to stand by.
You were the murderess of your baby,
silenced with a ‘z.’ You needed a hand,
the open-armed return of all your relations.
You wanted, harder than death, ampersand

All hail to the Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, He is the greatest preacher I did ever hear or see. He is a man of genius bright, And in him his congregation does delight, Because they find him to be honest and plain, Affable in temper, and seldom known to complain. He preaches in a plain straightforward way, The people flock to hear him night and day, And hundreds from the doors are often turn’d away, Because he is the greatest preacher of the present day. He has written the life of Sir Walter Scott, And while he lives he will never be forgot, Nor when he is dead, Because by his admirers it will be often read; And fill their minds with wonder and delight, And wile away the tedious hours on a cold winter’s night. He has also written about the Bards of the Bible, Which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle, Because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main, And to get an interview with him it would be almost vain, And in that he is always right, For the Bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do, Do it with all your might. Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, I must conclude my muse, And to write in praise of thee my pen does not refuse, Nor does it give me pain to tell the world fearlessly, that when You are dead they shall not look upon your like again.

Forbear, bold youth, all’s Heaven here,
 And what you do aver,To others, courtship may appear,
 ’Tis sacriledge to her.
She is a publick deity,
 And were’t not very oddShe should depose her self to be
 A pretty household god?
First make the sun in private shine,
 And bid the world adieu,That so he may his beams confine
 In complement to you.
But if of that you do despair,
 Think how you did amiss,To strive to fix her beams which are
 More bright and large than this.

I write my name as one, On sands by waves o’errun Or winter’s frosted pane, Traces a record vain.  Oblivion’s blankness claims Wiser and better names, And well my own may pass As from the strand or glass.  Wash on, O waves of time! Melt, noons, the frosty rime! Welcome the shadow vast, The silence that shall last!  When I and all who know And love me vanish so, What harm to them or me Will the lost memory be?  If any words of mine, Through right of life divine, Remain, what matters it Whose hand the message writ?  Why should the “crowner’s quest” Sit on my worst or best? Why should the showman claim The poor ghost of my name?  Yet, as when dies a sound Its spectre lingers round, Haply my spent life will Leave some faint echo still.  A whisper giving breath Of praise or blame to death, Soothing or saddening such As loved the living much.  Therefore with yearnings vain And fond I still would fain A kindly judgment seek, A tender thought bespeak.  And, while my words are read, Let this at least be said: “Whate’er his life’s defeatures, He loved his fellow-creatures.  “If, of the Law’s stone table, To hold he scarce was able The first great precept fast, He kept for man the last.  “Through mortal lapse and dulness What lacks the Eternal Fulness, If still our weakness can Love Him in loving man?  “Age brought him no despairing Of the world’s future faring; In human nature still He found more good than ill.  “To all who dumbly suffered, His tongue and pen he offered; His life was not his own, Nor lived for self alone.  “Hater of din and riot He lived in days unquiet; And, lover of all beauty, Trod the hard ways of duty.  “He meant no wrong to any He sought the good of many, Yet knew both sin and folly,— May God forgive him wholly!”

In Virgynë the sweltrie sun gan sheene,And hotte upon the mees did caste his raie;The apple rodded from its palie greene,And the mole peare did bende the leafy spraie;The peede chelandri sunge the livelong daie;’Twas nowe the pride, the manhode of the yeare,And eke the grounde was dighte in its moste defte aumere.
The sun was glemeing in the midde of daie,Deadde still the aire, and eke the welken blue,When from the sea arist in drear arraieA hepe of cloudes of sable sullen hue,The which full fast unto the woodlande drewe,Hiltring attenes the sunnis fetive face,And the blacke tempeste swolne and gatherd up apace.
Beneathe an holme, faste by a pathwaie side,Which dide unto Seyncte Godwine’s covent lede,A hapless pilgrim moneynge did abide.Pore in his newe, ungentle in his weede,Longe bretful of the miseries of neede,Where from the hail-stone coulde the almer flie?He had no housen theere, ne anie covent nie.
Look in his glommed face, his sprighte there scanne;Howe woe-be-gone, how withered, forwynd, deade!Haste to thie church-glebe-house, asshrewed manne!Haste to thie kiste, thie onlie dortoure bedde.Cale, as the claie whiche will gre on thie hedde,Is Charitie and Love aminge highe elves;Knightis and Barons live for pleasure and themselves.
The gatherd storme is rype; the bigge drops falle;The forswat meadowes smethe, and drenche the raine;The comyng ghastness do the cattle pall,And the full flockes are drivynge ore the plaine;Dashde from the cloudes the waters flott againe;The welkin opes; the yellow levynne flies;And the hot fierie smothe in the wide lowings dies.
Liste! now the thunder’s rattling clymmynge soundCheves slowlie on, and then embollen clangs,Shakes the hie spyre, and losst, dispended, drown’d,Still on the gallard eare of terroure hanges;The windes are up; the lofty elmen swanges;Again the levynne and the thunder poures,And the full cloudes are braste attenes in stonen showers.
Spurreynge his palfrie oere the watrie plaine,The Abbote of Seyncte Godwynes convente came;His chapournette was drented with the reine,And his pencte gyrdle met with mickle shame;He aynewarde tolde his bederoll at the same;The storme encreasen, and he drew aside,With the mist almes craver neere to the holme to bide.
His cope was all of Lyncolne clothe so fyne,With a gold button fasten’d neere his chynne;His autremete was edged with golden twynne,And his shoone pyke a loverds mighte have binne;Full well it shewn he thoughten coste no sinne:The trammels of the palfrye pleasde his sighte,For the horse-millanare his head with roses dighte.
“An almes, sir prieste!” the droppynge pilgrim saide,“O! let me waite within your covente dore,Till the sunne sheneth hie above our heade,And the loude tempeste of the aire is oer;Helpless and ould am I alas! and poor;No house, ne friend, ne moneie in my pouche;All yatte I call my owne is this my silver crouche.”
“Varlet,” replyd the Abbatte, “cease your dinne;This is no season almes and prayers to give;Mie porter never lets a faitour in;None touch mie rynge who not in honour live.”And now the sonne with the blacke cloudes did stryve,And shettynge on the grounde his glairie raie,The Abbatte spurrde his steede, and eftsoones roadde awaie.
Once moe the skie was blacke, the thunder rolde;Faste reyneynge oer the plaine a prieste was seen;Ne dighte full proude, ne buttoned up in golde;His cope and jape were graie, and eke were clene;A Limitoure he was of order seene;And from the pathwaie side then turned hee,Where the pore almer laie binethe the holmen tree.
“An almes, sir priest!” the droppynge pilgrim sayde,“For sweete Seyncte Marie and your order sake.”The Limitoure then loosen’d his pouche threade,And did thereoute a groate of silver take;The mister pilgrim dyd for halline shake.“Here take this silver, it maie eathe thie care;We are Goddes stewards all, nete of oure owne we bare.
“But ah! unhailie pilgrim, lerne of me,Scathe anie give a rentrolle to their Lorde.Here take my semecope, thou arte bare I see;Tis thyne; the Seynctes will give me mie rewarde.”He left the pilgrim, and his waie aborde.Virgynne and hallie Seyncte, who sitte yn gloure,Or give the mittee will, or give the gode man power.

The merchant, to secure his treasure,
 Conveys it in a borrowed name;Euphelia serves to grace my measure,
 But Cloe is my real flame.
My softest verse, my darling lyre,
 Upon Euphelia’s toilet lay;When Cloe noted her desire
 That I should sing, that I should play.
My lyre I tune, my voice I raise,
 But with my numbers mix my sighs;And whilst I sing Euphelia’s praise,
 I fix my soul on Cloe’s eyes.
Fair Cloe blushed; Euphelia frowned;
 I sung and gazed; I played and trembled;And Venus to the Loves around
 Remarked how ill we all dissembled.

after Sappho



Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine, Except these kisses of my lips on thine Brand them with immortality; but me – Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea, Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold Cast forth of heaven, with feet of awful gold And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind, Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsown, But in the light and laughter, in the moan And music, and in grasp of lip and hand And shudder of water that makes felt on land The immeasurable tremor of all the sea, Memories shall mix and metaphors of me.

If you believe in the magic of language,
then Elvis really Lives
and Princess Diana foretold I end as car spin. 
If you believe the letters themselves
contain a power within them,
then you understand
what makes outside tedious,
how desperation becomes a rope ends it. 
The circular logic that allows senator to become treason,
and treason to become atoners. 
That eleven plus two is twelve plus one,
and an admirer is also married. 
That if you could just rearrange things the right way
you’d find your true life,
the right path, the answer to your questions:
you’d understand how the Titanic
turns into that ice tin,
and debit card becomes bad credit. 
How listen is the same as silent,
and not one letter separates stained from sainted.

I rubbed wax crayon against blowing paper.
From the rock face footed a dancer white through red.
    My family gave me over
    to it, gone for the river. 
Were I a peasant harvesting grapes near Beaune
in the last century, even, I might have dreamed
    a saint lifting off for Arles,
    Les Saintes Maries de la Mer, 
and knowing about cannon in that long peace,
might have been troubled therefore that my flier
    hauled a magnum of the best
    and bloodied the west sky with it 
and vanished. My fisting that loose sheet in place
was secretarial, not visionary!
    Already in that decade
    small tribes entered the void 
like windows on a skyscraper when the bent
janitor makes his way. But those flick back on
    each night, costly difference.
    It is not only portents 
in dream or flapping images of the gone
or the soon-to-be-going or the tremblingly poised
    that catch like undertow
    the foot in tide-rip toeing 
down the singing or remembered beach.
We study populations in the forests,
    we hold the paper flat,
    mark, note, warn—the dictated 
prophecies do their work, we do some work—
cut horn from rhinos so they won’t be poached.
    But, to go on from there,
    one needs to stand in the doorway 
some evening and feel the air as if it were fire
pulling illusionlessly, letting the draw
    of one fact heat its chain
    of links, such as, Japan 
clear-cutting forests in Siberia
where tigers not already harvested
    lope their dwindling range,
    two hundred as the hinge 
for their growled arc of existence, bones of the others
ground to powders for old men’s potencies.
    One needs to feel the tug
    of the draft on skin, the drag 
of process utterly anciently itself.
Faster, now, the pull is from birth through dwelling through
    dissolution, along lines
    streaming through us, ageless winds.

The star dissolved in evening—the one star
The silently

And still the light now
                                    and still now the large
Relinquishing

Gathering darkness:
                              I was small. I lay
Beside my mother on the grass, and sleep
Came— 
          slow hooves and dripping with the dark
The velvet muzzles, the white feet that move
In a dream water
                        and O soon now soon
Sleep and the night. 
                              And I was not afraid.
Her hand lay over mine. Her fingers knew
Darkness,—and sleep—the silent lands, the far
Far off of morning where I should awake.

It was so simple: you came back to me
And I was happy. Nothing seemed to matter
But that. That you had gone away from me
And lived for days with him—it didn’t matter.
That I had been left to care for our old dog
And house alone—couldn’t have mattered less!
On all this, you and I and our happy dog
Agreed. We slept. The world was worriless. 
I woke in the morning, brimming with old joys
Till the fact-checker showed up, late, for work
And started in: Item: it’s years, not days.
Item: you had no dog. Item: she isn’t back,
In fact, she just remarried. And oh yes, item: you
Left her, remember?

“And if I did, what then? Are you aggriev’d therefore? The sea hath fish for every man, And what would you have more?”     Thus did my mistress once, Amaze my mind with doubt; And popp’d a question for the nonce To beat my brains about.     Whereto I thus replied: “Each fisherman can wish That all the seas at every tide Were his alone to fish.     “And so did I (in vain) But since it may not be, Let such fish there as find the gain, And leave the loss for me.     “And with such luck and loss I will content myself, Till tides of turning time may toss Such fishers on the shelf.     “And when they stick on sands, That every man may see, Then will I laugh and clap my hands, As they do now at me.”

My mother died one summer—
the wettest in the records of the state.
Crops rotted in the west.
Checked tablecloths dissolved in back gardens.
Empty deck chairs collected rain.
As I took my way to her
through traffic, through lilacs dripping blackly
behind houses
and on curbsides, to pay her
the last tribute of a daughter, I thought of something
I remembered
I heard once, that the body is, or is
said to be, almost all
water and as I turned southward, that ours is
a city of it,
one in which
every single day the elements begin
a journey towards each other that will never,
given our weather,
fail—
       the ocean visible in the edges cut by it,
cloud color reaching into air,
the Liffey storing one and summoning the other,
salt greeting the lack of it at the North Wall and,
as if that wasn't enough, all of it
ending up almost every evening
inside our speech— coast canal ocean river stream and now mother and I drove on and although
the mind is unreliable in grief, at
the next cloudburst it almost seemed
they could be shades of each other,
the way the body is
of every one of them and now
they were on the move again—fog into mist,
mist into sea spray and both into the oily glaze
that lay on the railings of
the house she was dying in
as I went inside.

like a downhill brakes-burned freight train
full of pig iron ingots, full of lead
life-size statues of Richard Nixon,
like an avalanche of smoke and black fog
lashed by bent pins, the broken-off tips
of switchblade knives, the dust of dried offal,
remorseless, it comes, faster when you turn your back,
faster when you turn to face it,
like a fine rain, then colder showers,
then downpour to razor sleet, then egg-size hail,
fist-size, then jagged
laser, shrapnel hail
thudding and tearing like footsteps
of drunk gods or fathers; it comes
polite, loutish, assured, suave,
breathing through its mouth
(which is a hole eaten by a cave),
it comes like an elephant annoyed,
like a black mamba terrified, it slides
down the valley, grease on grease,
like fire eating birds’ nests,
like fire melting the fuzz
off a baby’s skull, still it comes: mute
and gorging, never
to cease, insatiable, gorging
and mute.

And, the last day being come, Man stood alone Ere sunrise on the world’s dismantled verge, Awaiting how from everywhere should urge The Coming of the Lord. And, behold, none  Did come,—but indistinct from every realm Of earth and air and water, growing more And louder, shriller, heavier, a roar Up the dun atmosphere did overwhelm  His ears; and as he looked affrighted round Every manner of beast innumerable All thro’ the shadows crying grew, until The wailing was like grass upon the ground.  Asudden then within his human side Their anguish, since the goad he wielded first, And, since he gave them not to drink, their thirst, Darted compressed and vital.—As he died,  Low in the East now lighting gorgeously He saw the last sea-serpent iris-mailed Which, with a spear transfixèd, yet availed To pluck the sun down into the dead sea.

The sea and a crescent strip of beach
Show between the service station and a deserted shack 
A creek drains thru the beach
Forming a ditch
There is a discarded super-market cart in the ditch   
That beach is the edge of a nation 
There is something like shouting along the highway   
A California shouting
On the long fast highway over the California mountains 
Point Pedro   
Its distant life 
It is impossible the world should be either good or bad   
If its colors are beautiful or if they are not beautiful   
If parts of it taste good or if no parts of it taste good   
It is as remarkable in one case as the other
                                                                   As against this 
We have suffered fear, we know something of fear   
And of humiliation mounting to horror 
The world above the edge of the foxhole belongs to the flying bullets, leaden superbeings
For the men grovelling in the foxhole danger, danger in being drawn to them  These little dumps
The poem is about them 
Our hearts are twisted   
In dead men’s pride 
Dead men crowd us   
Lean over us 
In the emplacements 
The skull spins   
Empty of subject 
The hollow ego 
Flinching from the war’s huge air 
Tho we are delivery boys and bartenders    
We will choke on each other 
Minds may crack 
But not for what is discovered 
Unless that everyone knew   
And kept silent 
Our minds are split
To seek the danger out 
From among the miserable soldiers


^^EOP^^

And then we cowards
who loved the whispering
evening, the houses,
the paths by the river,
the dirty red lights
of those places, the sweet
soundless sorrow—
we reached our hands out
toward the living chain
in silence, but our heart
startled us with blood,
and no more sweetness then,
no more losing ourselves
on the path by the river—
no longer slaves, we knew
we were alone and alive.

You can’t say it that way any more.   
Bothered about beauty you have to   
Come out into the open, into a clearing,
And rest. Certainly whatever funny happens to you
Is OK. To demand more than this would be strange
Of you, you who have so many lovers,   
People who look up to you and are willing   
To do things for you, but you think
It’s not right, that if they really knew you . . .
So much for self-analysis. Now,
About what to put in your poem-painting:   
Flowers are always nice, particularly delphinium.   
Names of boys you once knew and their sleds,   
Skyrockets are good—do they still exist?
There are a lot of other things of the same quality   
As those I’ve mentioned. Now one must
Find a few important words, and a lot of low-keyed,
Dull-sounding ones. She approached me
About buying her desk. Suddenly the street was   
Bananas and the clangor of Japanese instruments.   
Humdrum testaments were scattered around. His head
Locked into mine. We were a seesaw. Something   
Ought to be written about how this affects   
You when you write poetry:
The extreme austerity of an almost empty mind
Colliding with the lush, Rousseau-like foliage of its desire to communicate   
Something between breaths, if only for the sake   
Of others and their desire to understand you and desert you
For other centers of communication, so that understanding
May begin, and in doing so be undone.

I 
Androgyne, mon amour,
brochette de coeur was plat du jour,
             (heart lifted on a metal skewer,
             encore saignante et palpitante)
where I dined au solitaire,
table intime, one rose vase,
             lighted dimly, wildly gay,
as, punctually, across the bay
mist advanced its pompe funèbre,
its coolly silvered drift of gray,
             nightly requiem performed for
mourners who have slipped away... 
Well, that's it, the evening scene,
mon amour, Androgyne. 
             Noontime youths,
thighs and groins tight-jean-displayed,
             loiter onto Union Square,
junkies flower-scattered there,
             lost in dream, torso-bare,
young as you, old as I, voicing soundlessly
a cry,
             oh, yes, among them
revolution bites its tongue beneath its fiery
             waiting stare,
indifferent to siren's wail,
ravishment endured in jail.
      Bicentennial salute?
Youth made flesh of crouching brute. 
(Dichotomy can I deny of pity in a lustful eye?) 
II 
Androgyne, mon amour,
shadows of you name a price
exorbitant for short lease.
What would you suggest I do,
wryly smile and turn away,
fox-teeth gnawing chest-bones through? 
Even less would that be true
than, carnally, I was to you
many, many lives ago,
requiems of fallen snow. 
And, frankly, well, they'd laugh at me,
thick of belly, thin of shank,
spectacle of long neglect,
tragedian of public mirth. 
(Chekhov's Mashas all wore black
for a reason I suspect:
Pertinence? None at all—
yet something made me think of that.) 
"Life!" the gob exclaimed to Crane,
"Oh, life's a geyser!"
             Oui, d'accord—
from the rectum of the earth. 
Bitter, that. Never mind.
Time's only challenger is time. 
III 
Androgyne, mon amour,
cold withdrawal is no cure
for addiction grown so deep.
Now, finally, at cock's crow,
released in custody of sleep,
dark annealment, time-worn stones
             far descending,
no light there, no sound there,
entering depths of thinning breath,
farther down more ancient stones,
halting not, drawn on until 
             Ever treacherous, ever fair,
             at a table small and square,
not first light but last light shows
(meaning of the single rose
where I dined au solitaire
sous l'ombre d'une jeunesse perdue?) 
             A ghostly little customs-clerk
             ("Vos documents, Mesdames, Messieurs?")
             whose somehow tender mockery
contrives to make admittance here
             at this mineral frontier
a definition of the pure... 
             Androgyne, mon amour. 
                                                                   San Francisco, 1976

Had I remained in innocent security,I should have thought all men were born my slaves,And worn my power like lightning in my eyes,To have destroyed at pleasure when offended.—But when love held the mirror, the undeceiving glassReflected all the weakness of my soul, and made me knowMy richest treasure being lost, my honour,All the remaining spoil could not be worthThe conqueror’s care or value.—Oh how I fell like a long worshipped idolDiscovering all the cheat.

                    They have little use. They are best as objects of torment.
         No government cares what you do with them.

         Like birds, and yet so human . . .
         They mate by briefly looking at the other.
         Their eggs are like white jellybeans.

         Sometimes they have been said to inspire a man to do more with his life than he might have.
         But what is there for a man to do with his life?

         . . . They burn beautifully with a blue flame.

         When they cry out it is like the screech of a tiny hinge; the cry of a bat. No one hears it . . .

The epitaphios of Thessaloniki



From those few famous silkworms smuggled
Into Constantinople in the head of a walking stick   
Silk waterfalls
Poured from the ancient bolts 
Into now-destitute reservoirs   
Of church treasuries in Aachen,   
In Liège, in Maastricht, in Sens,
In the Sancta Sanctorum of the Vatican, 
Bright rivers seeping past
The age when a teaspoonful of   
Silkworm eggs the size of one grain   
Could endow a church, 
The age when the letters in the words   
Of sacred testaments were
Unreeled in the coastal cities of Asia Minor,   
When a bookworm conspired 
To wrest a maze of empty roads   
Through the words My Lord—
That ancient, flickering text   
Once permanently affixed 
By blind but face-picturing, speechless   
But law-breaking wooden shuttles,   
Now a heap of gold wires displayed
With a crumbling silk vestment someone 
Plucked from a shovelful of dust
During one of those treasure hunts conducted   
In the burying grounds, in other eras,
A shovelful of dust 
Now blowing into your eyes,
As if a storm wind from Paradise   
Blew the rumors of this death
So hard you must cover your eyes 
Before the museum case.
The late afternoon tugs
At a gold thread you can hear fraying   
When you close your eyes, 
A thread you feel your way along,
A thread at which the invisible globe pulls,   
Leading you to the end of the world   
Where there is a pile of 
Clothes stolen from the grave,   
Where your fear is relegated
To a masterwork of silk slaves—
That He is dead. 
Here death is only a flash of worlds   
Unfurled from a rifled
Church treasury, and you are invited   
To walk this alluvial wave of gold, 
To walk in the labyrinths
Of the angels’ howls,
To run your hands along the walls   
Of the silk thread’s passageways, 
To feel with your fingers
The angels’ barbaric, stifled,   
Glittering vowels
Tightly woven with gold wires. 
If you were to tug at one,   
Unraveling the angels
Into a vivid labyrinth of thread   
From the fourteenth century 
Backwards to the scissors blade   
A seraph takes to a fragile
Filament of gilt
According to a law still unrevealed, 
The shroud would disappear   
In the gust of a little breeze   
From this door left ajar
Into the next life, 
The threshold we cross with closed eyes—   
Where angels hide behind their backs   
The saws with which they mean
To saw the present from the past, 
Oblivious to the scarlet threads   
That prove to be hidden among   
The filaments, those red rivers   
Running through the theme of time 
So shockingly—so before you set foot there,   
Take heed. This is the work
Of Byzantine silk slaves confined
To the palace grounds at Constantinople, 
And you must beware.
There was a way station
On the Silk Road
Where the authorities executed 
Traitors in a wooden box
In innumerable, unspeakable ways.
When you touch this shroud from the east   
You take that hundred feet of road. 
You must walk softly past.
You must try not to look.
The torrent of words—later, later.   
Here tongues are cut out, 
And that is why the howling   
Is mute,
Gilded, herringboned.
Because although this is death, 
It is the work of slaves
Whose task was only
To expose the maximum amount of gold thread   
To the ceiling price of so many nomismata 
Per square inch, in a swift mischief   
Of curious knots, of mazes
Flashing past, of straight paths   
Made inextricable, 
So look again.
The angels wring their hands   
Over a statue. They are deranged,   
But not by grief. They mourn 
Not a body, but a work in bronze.
They do not bring a mortal to the grave.   
But we onlookers who grieve and grieve—
We cannot relegate this thought 
To a glory woven cryptically
In heavy silks;
We cannot consign it, sweep it off,   
For we cannot weigh 
In our palms the empty cocoons,   
We cannot study
Within the secret workshops   
Of the silkworm, 
We cannot touch the boiling   
Water where the spools whirl,   
We cannot learn firsthand   
The bleakness of the craft 
With which God made the world,   
We cannot recount the legend that,   
When they met face-to-face, both   
God and the worm laughed.

Whenever I touch the cairn
marking the summit
of one of my parents,
touch the top stone,
an animal caution comes over me,
sinew and muscle like the brook’s,
a sudden shivering
green-brown flame.
Soon they will be constellations,
and I a small tower of stones.

The mower flipped it belly up,
a baby garter less than a foot long,
dull green with a single sharp 
stripe of pale manila down its back,
same color as the underside
which was cut in two places, 
a loop of intestine poking out. 
It wouldn't live,
so I ran the blades over it again, 
and cut it again but didn’t kill it, 
and again and then again,
a cloud of two-cycle fuel smoke
on me like a swarm of bees. 
It took so long
my mind had time to spiral
back to the graveyard 
I tended as a child
for the dead ones, wild and tame:
fish from the bubbling green aquarium, 
squirrels from the road,
the bluejay stalked to a raucous death
by Cicero the patient, the tireless hunter, 
who himself was laid to rest
one August afternoon
under a rock painted gray, his color, 
with a white splash for his white splash. 
Once in the woods I found the skeleton
of a deer laid out like a diagram, 
long spine curved like a necklace of crude, ochre spools
with the string rotted away, 
and the dull metal shaft of the arrow
lying where it must have pierced 
not the heart, not the head,
but the underbelly, the soft part
where the sex once was. 
I carried home the skull
with its nubs of not-yet-horns
which the mice had overlooked, 
and set it on a rock
in my kingdom of the dead. 
Before I chopped the little snake
to bits of raw mosaic, 
it drew itself
into an upward-straining coil,
head weaving, mouth open, 
hissing at the noise that hurt it. 
The stripe was made
of tiny paper diamonds,
sharp-edged but insubstantial, 
like an x-ray of the spine
or the ghost beginning to pull away. 
What taught the snake to make itself
seem bigger than it was,
to spend those last few seconds 
dancing in the roar
and shadow of its death? 
Now I see, though none exists,
its grave: 
harebells withered in a jar,
a yellow spiral
painted on a green-black stone, 
a ring of upright pine cones for a fence.
That’s how the deer skull lay in state 
until one of the neighborhood dogs
came to claim it, 
and carried it off to bury
in the larger graveyard of the world.

If I had a hundred dollars to spend,
    Or maybe a little more,
I’d hurry as fast as my legs would go
    Straight to the animal store. 
I wouldn’t say, “How much for this or that?”
    “What kind of a dog is he?”
I’d buy as many as rolled an eye,
    Or wagged a tail at me! 
I’d take the hound with the drooping ears
    That sits by himself alone;
Cockers and Cairns and wobbly pups
    For to be my very own. 
I might buy a parrot all red and green,
    And the monkey I saw before,
If I had a hundred dollars to spend,
    Or maybe a little more.

At night, alone, the animals came and shone.
The darkness whirled but silent shone the animals:   
The lion the man the calf the eagle saying   
Sanctus which was and is and is to come. 
The sleeper watched the people at the waterless wilderness’ edge;   
The wilderness was made of granite, of thorn, of death,   
It was the goat which lightened the people praying.
The goat went out with sin on its sunken head. 
On the sleeper’s midnight and the smaller after hours   
From above below elsewhere there shone the animals   
Through the circular dark; the cock appeared in light   
Crying three times, for tears for tears for tears. 
High in the frozen tree the sparrow sat. At three o’clock   
The luminous thunder of its fall fractured the earth.   
The somber serpent looped its coils to write
In scales the slow snake-music of the red ripe globe. 
To the sleeper, alone, the animals came and shone,   
The darkness whirled but silent shone the animals.   
Just before dawn the dove flew out of the dark
Flying with green in her beak; the dove also had come.

New life! Will he toe out like Dolly, like John? Will her eyes be fires?
Blue and green, like Papa's, the ocean at the shore?
Will she sing in the bath? Play piano in her diapers?
Will her heart leap at large machinery? Will he say, "Dribe dribe,"
to his daddy, entering the tunnel? Will his hair be red? Will her hair curl?
Will her little face have the circumflex eyebrows of her mother?
   The pointed chin?
Her hair be fair, bright blonde? Will she frown at the light by the river?
Oh, let her head fill with Greek Owls, her mouth with honey wine.
Let his hands cup the keys, the air of the studio filling with sound, the crunch of
cornflakes, the sift of raw sugar on the tongue, the great chords. 
And let the parents be fierce forever, Lord, as You are, exacting
price and penalty for Your gifts, so they grow strong and joyous,
blessed by the memory of the black car, open to air,
chosen by a child in token of the power they give over,
their lives in service to new life, the great melt of petals under snow, the green rising.

I said you could snuggle. That doesn’t mean
your cold feet all over my dick. 
Someone should teach you how to act in bed.
What I think is you should
keep your extremities to yourself. 
Look what you did—
you made the cat move. 
            But I didn’t want your hand there.
            I wanted your hand here. 
            You should pay attention to my feet.
            You should picture them
            the next time you see a hot fifteen year old.
            Because there’s a lot more where those feet come from.

All Kings, and all their favourites,
         All glory of honours, beauties, wits,
    The sun itself, which makes times, as they pass,
    Is elder by a year now than it was
    When thou and I first one another saw:
    All other things to their destruction draw,
         Only our love hath no decay;
    This no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday,
    Running it never runs from us away,
But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day. 
         Two graves must hide thine and my corse;
         If one might, death were no divorce.
    Alas, as well as other Princes, we
    (Who Prince enough in one another be)
    Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears,
    Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears;
         But souls where nothing dwells but love
    (All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove
    This, or a love increasèd there above,
When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove. 
         And then we shall be throughly blessed;
         But we no more than all the rest.
    Here upon earth we’re Kings, and none but we
    Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects be;
    Who is so safe as we? where none can do
    Treason to us, except one of us two.
         True and false fears let us refrain,
    Let us love nobly, and live, and add again
    Years and years unto years, till we attain
To write threescore: this is the second of our reign.

The Baltic Sea froze in 1307. Birds flew north
From the Mediterranean in early January.
There were meteor storms throughout Europe. 
On the first day of Lent
Two children took their own lives:
Their bodies
Were sewn into goatskins
And were dragged by the hangman’s horse
The three miles down to the sea.
They were given a simple grave in the sand. 
The following Sunday, Meister Eckhart
Shouted that a secret word
Had been spoken to him. He preached 
That Mary Magdalene
Sought a dead man in the tomb
But, in her confusion, found
Only two angels laughing. . . 
This was a consequence of her purity 
And her all too human grief.
The Baltic Sea
Also froze in 1303—
Nothing happened that was worthy of poetry.

I was on the porch pinching back the lobelia
like trimming a great blue head of hair. 
We’d just planted the near field, the far one
the day before. I’d never seen it so clear, 
so gusty, so overcast, so clear, so calm.
They say pearls must be worn or they lose their luster, 
and that morning I happened to remember,
so I put them on for milking, finding some 
sympathy, I guess, between the two.
Usually I don’t sit down until much later in the day. 
The lobelia was curling in the sun. One by one
birds flew off, and that should have been a sign. 
Trust is made and broken. I hardly sit down
at all. It was the time of year for luna moths, 
but we hadn’t had any yet settling on the porch
or hovering above the garden I’d let the wild rose take.


^^EOP^^

Debasement is the password of the base,
Nobility the epitaph of the noble.
See how the gilded sky is covered
With the drifting twisted shadows of the dead. 
The Ice Age is over now,
Why is there ice everywhere?
The Cape of Good Hope has been discovered,
Why do a thousand sails contest the Dead Sea? 
I came into this world
Bringing only paper, rope, a shadow,
To proclaim before the judgment
The voice that has been judged: 
Let me tell you, world,
I—do—not—believe!
If a thousand challengers lie beneath your feet,
Count me as number thousand and one. 
I don't believe the sky is blue;
I don't believe in thunder's echoes;
I don't believe that dreams are false;
I don't believe that death has no revenge. 
If the sea is destined to breach the dikes
Let all the brackish water pour into my heart;
If the land is destined to rise
Let humanity choose a peak for existence again. 
A new conjunction and glimmering stars
Adorn the unobstructed sky now;
They are the pictographs from five thousand years.
They are the watchful eyes of future generations.

To Pope’s ImpromptuTitle and Epigraph This poem is also known by a longer title: "To Mr. Pope In answer to a coppy of verses occasion'd by a little dispute upon four lines in the Rape of the Lock"   Finch is responding to these four lines from Pope's The Rape of the Lock (first published 1712, finished 1717):  Parent of vapors and of female wit, Who give the hysteric or poetic fit,  On various tempers act by various ways,  Make some take physic, other scribble plays; (Canto 4, lines 59-62)  Alexander Pope's poem "Impromptu, To Lady Winchelsea Occasion'd by Four Satyrical Verses on Women-Wits, in The Rape of the Lock":  In vain you boast Poetic Names of yore,  And cite those Sapphos we admire no more:  Fate doom'd the Fall of ev'ry Female Wit;  But doom'd it then when first Ardelia writ.  Of all Examples by the World confess'd,  I knew Ardelia could not quote the best;  Who, like her Mistress on Britannia's Throne;  Fights and subdues in Quarrels not her own.  To write their Praise you but in vain essay;  Ev'n while you write, you take that Praise away:  Light to the Stars the Sun does thus restore,  But shines himself till they are seen no more.   "Ardelia" is Finch's pen-name. The poem was written around 1714, and published in Bayle's Dictionary in 1741.   Pope’s and Finch’s poem share the words "fate" and "world," and Pope's use of "admire" is echoed in Finch's use of "admiration."



Disarmed with so genteel an air,    The contest I give o’er; Yet, Alexander, have a care,    And shockshock Echoes the Shock from Pope's The Rape of the Lock where the word suggests a military campaign: "Or whether Heaven has doomed that Shock must fall. /. . . / Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock." (Canto 2, lines 110, 116), and in Belinda's words from Canto 4, line 164: ". . . Shock was most unkind!" the sex no moreno more Finch echoes Pope's use of “no more” in "Impromptu": “In vain you boast Poetic Names of yore, / And cite those Sapphos we admire no more:“ and “Light to the Stars the Sun does thus restore, / But shines himself till they are seen no more.” . We rule the world our life’s whole race,    Men but assume that right; First slaves to ev’ry tempting faceFirst slaves to ev’ry tempting face Compare Pope's lines from The Rape of the Lock: "If to her share some female errors fall, / Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all."

to Helena Shire



The Makers did not make
The muddy winter hardening to privation,
Or cholera in the keep, or frost’s long ache
      Afflicting every mortal nation
From lord to villagers in their fading dyes
            —Those who like oxen strained   
      On stony clearings of the ground   
               From church to sties. 
            They sought an utterance,
Or sunshine soluble in institution,
An orthodoxy justified, at once
      The dream and dreamer warmed in fusion,
As in the great Rose Window, pieced from duty,
            Where through Christ’s crimson, sun   
      Shines on your clothes till they take on
               Value and beauty. 
            But carved on a high beam
Far in the vault from the official version
Gape gnarled unChristian heads out of whom stream   
      Long stems of contrary assertion,
Shaped leaf ridging their scalps in place of hair.   
            Their origins lost to sight,
      As they are too, cast out from light.
               They should despair. 
            What stays for its own sake,
Occulted in the dark, may slip an ending,
Recalcitrant, and strengthened by the ache
      Of winter not for the transcending.   
Ice and snow pile the gables of the roof
            Within whose shade they hold,
      Intimate with its slaty cold,
               To Christ aloof.

Remember the night you got drunk
and shot the roses?
You were a perfect stranger, Father,
even my bad sister cried. 
Some other gravity,
not death or luck,
drew fish out of the sea
and started them panting. 
The fish became a man.
The archer’s bow became a violin.
I remember the night you searched the sofa
for change 
and wept on the telephone.
Some other gravity,
not time or entropy,
pulled the knife down for centuries. 
The archers dropped their bows,
harmless as pine needles in the snow.
The knife became a plow
and entered the earth, Father. 
Later it became a boat
and some other things —
It isn’t a dream but it takes a long time,
for the archer’s bow to become a violin.

We pull off
to a road shack
in Massachusetts
to watch men walk 
on the moon. We did   
the same thing
for three two one
blast off, and now 
we watch the same men   
bounce in and out
of craters. I want
a Coke and a hamburger. 
Because the men
are walking on the moon   
which is now irrefutably   
not green, not cheese, 
not a shiny dime floating   
in a cold blue,
the way I'd thought,
the road shack people don't 
notice we are a black   
family not from there,   
the way it mostly goes.   
This talking through 
static, bounces in space-
boots, tethered   
to cords is much   
stranger, stranger 
even than we are.

You can’t say it that way any more.   
Bothered about beauty you have to   
Come out into the open, into a clearing,
And rest. Certainly whatever funny happens to you
Is OK. To demand more than this would be strange
Of you, you who have so many lovers,   
People who look up to you and are willing   
To do things for you, but you think
It’s not right, that if they really knew you . . .
So much for self-analysis. Now,
About what to put in your poem-painting:   
Flowers are always nice, particularly delphinium.   
Names of boys you once knew and their sleds,   
Skyrockets are good—do they still exist?
There are a lot of other things of the same quality   
As those I’ve mentioned. Now one must
Find a few important words, and a lot of low-keyed,
Dull-sounding ones. She approached me
About buying her desk. Suddenly the street was   
Bananas and the clangor of Japanese instruments.   
Humdrum testaments were scattered around. His head
Locked into mine. We were a seesaw. Something   
Ought to be written about how this affects   
You when you write poetry:
The extreme austerity of an almost empty mind
Colliding with the lush, Rousseau-like foliage of its desire to communicate   
Something between breaths, if only for the sake   
Of others and their desire to understand you and desert you
For other centers of communication, so that understanding
May begin, and in doing so be undone.

I 
Androgyne, mon amour,
brochette de coeur was plat du jour,
             (heart lifted on a metal skewer,
             encore saignante et palpitante)
where I dined au solitaire,
table intime, one rose vase,
             lighted dimly, wildly gay,
as, punctually, across the bay
mist advanced its pompe funèbre,
its coolly silvered drift of gray,
             nightly requiem performed for
mourners who have slipped away... 
Well, that's it, the evening scene,
mon amour, Androgyne. 
             Noontime youths,
thighs and groins tight-jean-displayed,
             loiter onto Union Square,
junkies flower-scattered there,
             lost in dream, torso-bare,
young as you, old as I, voicing soundlessly
a cry,
             oh, yes, among them
revolution bites its tongue beneath its fiery
             waiting stare,
indifferent to siren's wail,
ravishment endured in jail.
      Bicentennial salute?
Youth made flesh of crouching brute. 
(Dichotomy can I deny of pity in a lustful eye?) 
II 
Androgyne, mon amour,
shadows of you name a price
exorbitant for short lease.
What would you suggest I do,
wryly smile and turn away,
fox-teeth gnawing chest-bones through? 
Even less would that be true
than, carnally, I was to you
many, many lives ago,
requiems of fallen snow. 
And, frankly, well, they'd laugh at me,
thick of belly, thin of shank,
spectacle of long neglect,
tragedian of public mirth. 
(Chekhov's Mashas all wore black
for a reason I suspect:
Pertinence? None at all—
yet something made me think of that.) 
"Life!" the gob exclaimed to Crane,
"Oh, life's a geyser!"
             Oui, d'accord—
from the rectum of the earth. 
Bitter, that. Never mind.
Time's only challenger is time. 
III 
Androgyne, mon amour,
cold withdrawal is no cure
for addiction grown so deep.
Now, finally, at cock's crow,
released in custody of sleep,
dark annealment, time-worn stones
             far descending,
no light there, no sound there,
entering depths of thinning breath,
farther down more ancient stones,
halting not, drawn on until 
             Ever treacherous, ever fair,
             at a table small and square,
not first light but last light shows
(meaning of the single rose
where I dined au solitaire
sous l'ombre d'une jeunesse perdue?) 
             A ghostly little customs-clerk
             ("Vos documents, Mesdames, Messieurs?")
             whose somehow tender mockery
contrives to make admittance here
             at this mineral frontier
a definition of the pure... 
             Androgyne, mon amour. 
                                                                   San Francisco, 1976


^^EOP^^

Had I remained in innocent security,I should have thought all men were born my slaves,And worn my power like lightning in my eyes,To have destroyed at pleasure when offended.—But when love held the mirror, the undeceiving glassReflected all the weakness of my soul, and made me knowMy richest treasure being lost, my honour,All the remaining spoil could not be worthThe conqueror’s care or value.—Oh how I fell like a long worshipped idolDiscovering all the cheat.

                    They have little use. They are best as objects of torment.
         No government cares what you do with them.

         Like birds, and yet so human . . .
         They mate by briefly looking at the other.
         Their eggs are like white jellybeans.

         Sometimes they have been said to inspire a man to do more with his life than he might have.
         But what is there for a man to do with his life?

         . . . They burn beautifully with a blue flame.

         When they cry out it is like the screech of a tiny hinge; the cry of a bat. No one hears it . . .

The epitaphios of Thessaloniki



From those few famous silkworms smuggled
Into Constantinople in the head of a walking stick   
Silk waterfalls
Poured from the ancient bolts 
Into now-destitute reservoirs   
Of church treasuries in Aachen,   
In Liège, in Maastricht, in Sens,
In the Sancta Sanctorum of the Vatican, 
Bright rivers seeping past
The age when a teaspoonful of   
Silkworm eggs the size of one grain   
Could endow a church, 
The age when the letters in the words   
Of sacred testaments were
Unreeled in the coastal cities of Asia Minor,   
When a bookworm conspired 
To wrest a maze of empty roads   
Through the words My Lord—
That ancient, flickering text   
Once permanently affixed 
By blind but face-picturing, speechless   
But law-breaking wooden shuttles,   
Now a heap of gold wires displayed
With a crumbling silk vestment someone 
Plucked from a shovelful of dust
During one of those treasure hunts conducted   
In the burying grounds, in other eras,
A shovelful of dust 
Now blowing into your eyes,
As if a storm wind from Paradise   
Blew the rumors of this death
So hard you must cover your eyes 
Before the museum case.
The late afternoon tugs
At a gold thread you can hear fraying   
When you close your eyes, 
A thread you feel your way along,
A thread at which the invisible globe pulls,   
Leading you to the end of the world   
Where there is a pile of 
Clothes stolen from the grave,   
Where your fear is relegated
To a masterwork of silk slaves—
That He is dead. 
Here death is only a flash of worlds   
Unfurled from a rifled
Church treasury, and you are invited   
To walk this alluvial wave of gold, 
To walk in the labyrinths
Of the angels’ howls,
To run your hands along the walls   
Of the silk thread’s passageways, 
To feel with your fingers
The angels’ barbaric, stifled,   
Glittering vowels
Tightly woven with gold wires. 
If you were to tug at one,   
Unraveling the angels
Into a vivid labyrinth of thread   
From the fourteenth century 
Backwards to the scissors blade   
A seraph takes to a fragile
Filament of gilt
According to a law still unrevealed, 
The shroud would disappear   
In the gust of a little breeze   
From this door left ajar
Into the next life, 
The threshold we cross with closed eyes—   
Where angels hide behind their backs   
The saws with which they mean
To saw the present from the past, 
Oblivious to the scarlet threads   
That prove to be hidden among   
The filaments, those red rivers   
Running through the theme of time 
So shockingly—so before you set foot there,   
Take heed. This is the work
Of Byzantine silk slaves confined
To the palace grounds at Constantinople, 
And you must beware.
There was a way station
On the Silk Road
Where the authorities executed 
Traitors in a wooden box
In innumerable, unspeakable ways.
When you touch this shroud from the east   
You take that hundred feet of road. 
You must walk softly past.
You must try not to look.
The torrent of words—later, later.   
Here tongues are cut out, 
And that is why the howling   
Is mute,
Gilded, herringboned.
Because although this is death, 
It is the work of slaves
Whose task was only
To expose the maximum amount of gold thread   
To the ceiling price of so many nomismata 
Per square inch, in a swift mischief   
Of curious knots, of mazes
Flashing past, of straight paths   
Made inextricable, 
So look again.
The angels wring their hands   
Over a statue. They are deranged,   
But not by grief. They mourn 
Not a body, but a work in bronze.
They do not bring a mortal to the grave.   
But we onlookers who grieve and grieve—
We cannot relegate this thought 
To a glory woven cryptically
In heavy silks;
We cannot consign it, sweep it off,   
For we cannot weigh 
In our palms the empty cocoons,   
We cannot study
Within the secret workshops   
Of the silkworm, 
We cannot touch the boiling   
Water where the spools whirl,   
We cannot learn firsthand   
The bleakness of the craft 
With which God made the world,   
We cannot recount the legend that,   
When they met face-to-face, both   
God and the worm laughed.

Whenever I touch the cairn
marking the summit
of one of my parents,
touch the top stone,
an animal caution comes over me,
sinew and muscle like the brook’s,
a sudden shivering
green-brown flame.
Soon they will be constellations,
and I a small tower of stones.


^^EOP^^

The mower flipped it belly up,
a baby garter less than a foot long,
dull green with a single sharp 
stripe of pale manila down its back,
same color as the underside
which was cut in two places, 
a loop of intestine poking out. 
It wouldn't live,
so I ran the blades over it again, 
and cut it again but didn’t kill it, 
and again and then again,
a cloud of two-cycle fuel smoke
on me like a swarm of bees. 
It took so long
my mind had time to spiral
back to the graveyard 
I tended as a child
for the dead ones, wild and tame:
fish from the bubbling green aquarium, 
squirrels from the road,
the bluejay stalked to a raucous death
by Cicero the patient, the tireless hunter, 
who himself was laid to rest
one August afternoon
under a rock painted gray, his color, 
with a white splash for his white splash. 
Once in the woods I found the skeleton
of a deer laid out like a diagram, 
long spine curved like a necklace of crude, ochre spools
with the string rotted away, 
and the dull metal shaft of the arrow
lying where it must have pierced 
not the heart, not the head,
but the underbelly, the soft part
where the sex once was. 
I carried home the skull
with its nubs of not-yet-horns
which the mice had overlooked, 
and set it on a rock
in my kingdom of the dead. 
Before I chopped the little snake
to bits of raw mosaic, 
it drew itself
into an upward-straining coil,
head weaving, mouth open, 
hissing at the noise that hurt it. 
The stripe was made
of tiny paper diamonds,
sharp-edged but insubstantial, 
like an x-ray of the spine
or the ghost beginning to pull away. 
What taught the snake to make itself
seem bigger than it was,
to spend those last few seconds 
dancing in the roar
and shadow of its death? 
Now I see, though none exists,
its grave: 
harebells withered in a jar,
a yellow spiral
painted on a green-black stone, 
a ring of upright pine cones for a fence.
That’s how the deer skull lay in state 
until one of the neighborhood dogs
came to claim it, 
and carried it off to bury
in the larger graveyard of the world.


^^EOP^^

If I had a hundred dollars to spend,
    Or maybe a little more,
I’d hurry as fast as my legs would go
    Straight to the animal store. 
I wouldn’t say, “How much for this or that?”
    “What kind of a dog is he?”
I’d buy as many as rolled an eye,
    Or wagged a tail at me! 
I’d take the hound with the drooping ears
    That sits by himself alone;
Cockers and Cairns and wobbly pups
    For to be my very own. 
I might buy a parrot all red and green,
    And the monkey I saw before,
If I had a hundred dollars to spend,
    Or maybe a little more.

At night, alone, the animals came and shone.
The darkness whirled but silent shone the animals:   
The lion the man the calf the eagle saying   
Sanctus which was and is and is to come. 
The sleeper watched the people at the waterless wilderness’ edge;   
The wilderness was made of granite, of thorn, of death,   
It was the goat which lightened the people praying.
The goat went out with sin on its sunken head. 
On the sleeper’s midnight and the smaller after hours   
From above below elsewhere there shone the animals   
Through the circular dark; the cock appeared in light   
Crying three times, for tears for tears for tears. 
High in the frozen tree the sparrow sat. At three o’clock   
The luminous thunder of its fall fractured the earth.   
The somber serpent looped its coils to write
In scales the slow snake-music of the red ripe globe. 
To the sleeper, alone, the animals came and shone,   
The darkness whirled but silent shone the animals.   
Just before dawn the dove flew out of the dark
Flying with green in her beak; the dove also had come.

New life! Will he toe out like Dolly, like John? Will her eyes be fires?
Blue and green, like Papa's, the ocean at the shore?
Will she sing in the bath? Play piano in her diapers?
Will her heart leap at large machinery? Will he say, "Dribe dribe,"
to his daddy, entering the tunnel? Will his hair be red? Will her hair curl?
Will her little face have the circumflex eyebrows of her mother?
   The pointed chin?
Her hair be fair, bright blonde? Will she frown at the light by the river?
Oh, let her head fill with Greek Owls, her mouth with honey wine.
Let his hands cup the keys, the air of the studio filling with sound, the crunch of
cornflakes, the sift of raw sugar on the tongue, the great chords. 
And let the parents be fierce forever, Lord, as You are, exacting
price and penalty for Your gifts, so they grow strong and joyous,
blessed by the memory of the black car, open to air,
chosen by a child in token of the power they give over,
their lives in service to new life, the great melt of petals under snow, the green rising.

I said you could snuggle. That doesn’t mean
your cold feet all over my dick. 
Someone should teach you how to act in bed.
What I think is you should
keep your extremities to yourself. 
Look what you did—
you made the cat move. 
            But I didn’t want your hand there.
            I wanted your hand here. 
            You should pay attention to my feet.
            You should picture them
            the next time you see a hot fifteen year old.
            Because there’s a lot more where those feet come from.

All Kings, and all their favourites,
         All glory of honours, beauties, wits,
    The sun itself, which makes times, as they pass,
    Is elder by a year now than it was
    When thou and I first one another saw:
    All other things to their destruction draw,
         Only our love hath no decay;
    This no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday,
    Running it never runs from us away,
But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day. 
         Two graves must hide thine and my corse;
         If one might, death were no divorce.
    Alas, as well as other Princes, we
    (Who Prince enough in one another be)
    Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears,
    Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears;
         But souls where nothing dwells but love
    (All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove
    This, or a love increasèd there above,
When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove. 
         And then we shall be throughly blessed;
         But we no more than all the rest.
    Here upon earth we’re Kings, and none but we
    Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects be;
    Who is so safe as we? where none can do
    Treason to us, except one of us two.
         True and false fears let us refrain,
    Let us love nobly, and live, and add again
    Years and years unto years, till we attain
To write threescore: this is the second of our reign.

The Baltic Sea froze in 1307. Birds flew north
From the Mediterranean in early January.
There were meteor storms throughout Europe. 
On the first day of Lent
Two children took their own lives:
Their bodies
Were sewn into goatskins
And were dragged by the hangman’s horse
The three miles down to the sea.
They were given a simple grave in the sand. 
The following Sunday, Meister Eckhart
Shouted that a secret word
Had been spoken to him. He preached 
That Mary Magdalene
Sought a dead man in the tomb
But, in her confusion, found
Only two angels laughing. . . 
This was a consequence of her purity 
And her all too human grief.
The Baltic Sea
Also froze in 1303—
Nothing happened that was worthy of poetry.

I was on the porch pinching back the lobelia
like trimming a great blue head of hair. 
We’d just planted the near field, the far one
the day before. I’d never seen it so clear, 
so gusty, so overcast, so clear, so calm.
They say pearls must be worn or they lose their luster, 
and that morning I happened to remember,
so I put them on for milking, finding some 
sympathy, I guess, between the two.
Usually I don’t sit down until much later in the day. 
The lobelia was curling in the sun. One by one
birds flew off, and that should have been a sign. 
Trust is made and broken. I hardly sit down
at all. It was the time of year for luna moths, 
but we hadn’t had any yet settling on the porch
or hovering above the garden I’d let the wild rose take.


^^EOP^^

Debasement is the password of the base,
Nobility the epitaph of the noble.
See how the gilded sky is covered
With the drifting twisted shadows of the dead. 
The Ice Age is over now,
Why is there ice everywhere?
The Cape of Good Hope has been discovered,
Why do a thousand sails contest the Dead Sea? 
I came into this world
Bringing only paper, rope, a shadow,
To proclaim before the judgment
The voice that has been judged: 
Let me tell you, world,
I—do—not—believe!
If a thousand challengers lie beneath your feet,
Count me as number thousand and one. 
I don't believe the sky is blue;
I don't believe in thunder's echoes;
I don't believe that dreams are false;
I don't believe that death has no revenge. 
If the sea is destined to breach the dikes
Let all the brackish water pour into my heart;
If the land is destined to rise
Let humanity choose a peak for existence again. 
A new conjunction and glimmering stars
Adorn the unobstructed sky now;
They are the pictographs from five thousand years.
They are the watchful eyes of future generations.

To Pope’s ImpromptuTitle and Epigraph This poem is also known by a longer title: "To Mr. Pope In answer to a coppy of verses occasion'd by a little dispute upon four lines in the Rape of the Lock"   Finch is responding to these four lines from Pope's The Rape of the Lock (first published 1712, finished 1717):  Parent of vapors and of female wit, Who give the hysteric or poetic fit,  On various tempers act by various ways,  Make some take physic, other scribble plays; (Canto 4, lines 59-62)  Alexander Pope's poem "Impromptu, To Lady Winchelsea Occasion'd by Four Satyrical Verses on Women-Wits, in The Rape of the Lock":  In vain you boast Poetic Names of yore,  And cite those Sapphos we admire no more:  Fate doom'd the Fall of ev'ry Female Wit;  But doom'd it then when first Ardelia writ.  Of all Examples by the World confess'd,  I knew Ardelia could not quote the best;  Who, like her Mistress on Britannia's Throne;  Fights and subdues in Quarrels not her own.  To write their Praise you but in vain essay;  Ev'n while you write, you take that Praise away:  Light to the Stars the Sun does thus restore,  But shines himself till they are seen no more.   "Ardelia" is Finch's pen-name. The poem was written around 1714, and published in Bayle's Dictionary in 1741.   Pope’s and Finch’s poem share the words "fate" and "world," and Pope's use of "admire" is echoed in Finch's use of "admiration."



Disarmed with so genteel an air,    The contest I give o’er; Yet, Alexander, have a care,    And shockshock Echoes the Shock from Pope's The Rape of the Lock where the word suggests a military campaign: "Or whether Heaven has doomed that Shock must fall. /. . . / Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock." (Canto 2, lines 110, 116), and in Belinda's words from Canto 4, line 164: ". . . Shock was most unkind!" the sex no moreno more Finch echoes Pope's use of “no more” in "Impromptu": “In vain you boast Poetic Names of yore, / And cite those Sapphos we admire no more:“ and “Light to the Stars the Sun does thus restore, / But shines himself till they are seen no more.” . We rule the world our life’s whole race,    Men but assume that right; First slaves to ev’ry tempting faceFirst slaves to ev’ry tempting face Compare Pope's lines from The Rape of the Lock: "If to her share some female errors fall, / Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all."

The Makers did not make
The muddy winter hardening to privation,
Or cholera in the keep, or frost’s long ache
      Afflicting every mortal nation
From lord to villagers in their fading dyes
            —Those who like oxen strained   
      On stony clearings of the ground   
               From church to sties. 
            They sought an utterance,
Or sunshine soluble in institution,
An orthodoxy justified, at once
      The dream and dreamer warmed in fusion,
As in the great Rose Window, pieced from duty,
            Where through Christ’s crimson, sun   
      Shines on your clothes till they take on
               Value and beauty. 
            But carved on a high beam
Far in the vault from the official version
Gape gnarled unChristian heads out of whom stream   
      Long stems of contrary assertion,
Shaped leaf ridging their scalps in place of hair.   
            Their origins lost to sight,
      As they are too, cast out from light.
               They should despair. 
            What stays for its own sake,
Occulted in the dark, may slip an ending,
Recalcitrant, and strengthened by the ache
      Of winter not for the transcending.   
Ice and snow pile the gables of the roof
            Within whose shade they hold,
      Intimate with its slaty cold,
               To Christ aloof.

Remember the night you got drunk
and shot the roses?
You were a perfect stranger, Father,
even my bad sister cried. 
Some other gravity,
not death or luck,
drew fish out of the sea
and started them panting. 
The fish became a man.
The archer’s bow became a violin.
I remember the night you searched the sofa
for change 
and wept on the telephone.
Some other gravity,
not time or entropy,
pulled the knife down for centuries. 
The archers dropped their bows,
harmless as pine needles in the snow.
The knife became a plow
and entered the earth, Father. 
Later it became a boat
and some other things —
It isn’t a dream but it takes a long time,
for the archer’s bow to become a violin.

We pull off
to a road shack
in Massachusetts
to watch men walk 
on the moon. We did   
the same thing
for three two one
blast off, and now 
we watch the same men   
bounce in and out
of craters. I want
a Coke and a hamburger. 
Because the men
are walking on the moon   
which is now irrefutably   
not green, not cheese, 
not a shiny dime floating   
in a cold blue,
the way I'd thought,
the road shack people don't 
notice we are a black   
family not from there,   
the way it mostly goes.   
This talking through 
static, bounces in space-
boots, tethered   
to cords is much   
stranger, stranger

Robinson at cards at the Algonquin; a thin
Blue light comes down once more outside the blinds.   
Gray men in overcoats are ghosts blown past the door.   
The taxis streak the avenues with yellow, orange, and red.   
This is Grand Central, Mr. Robinson. 
Robinson on a roof above the Heights; the boats
Mourn like the lost. Water is slate, far down.
Through sounds of ice cubes dropped in glass, an osteopath,   
Dressed for the links, describes an old Intourist tour.   
—Here’s where old Gibbons jumped from, Robinson. 
Robinson walking in the Park, admiring the elephant.   
Robinson buying the Tribune, Robinson buying the Times. Robinson
Saying, “Hello. Yes, this is Robinson. Sunday
At five? I’d love to. Pretty well. And you?”
Robinson alone at Longchamps, staring at the wall. 
Robinson afraid, drunk, sobbing Robinson
In bed with a Mrs. Morse. Robinson at home;
Decisions: Toynbee or luminol? Where the sun
Shines, Robinson in flowered trunks, eyes toward
The breakers. Where the night ends, Robinson in East Side bars. 
Robinson in Glen plaid jacket, Scotch-grain shoes,   
Black four-in-hand and oxford button-down,
The jeweled and silent watch that winds itself, the brief-
Case, covert topcoat, clothes for spring, all covering   
His sad and usual heart, dry as a winter leaf.

will poke through
                           the foliage
peering
            at experience. 
Who is like man
                        sitting in the cell
of referents,
                     whose eye
has never seen
                      a jungle,
yet looks in? 
It is the great eye,
                               source of security.
Praised be thou,

Like hearts marked out but not yet colored in,   
Each of her feathers has a black edge,   
as if an India-ink mantilla stretched 
from uncleaved neck to her fantail. The pen,   
homemade, spilled some darkness now and then.   
She doesn’t lack for suitors. Poor rooster, 
who pours his own loud heart out to her,   
surely his begging does no more than force   
her to peck out a crooked tattoo in the dirt 
of the pen. Is she stumped, sad, anorexic?   
It’s perfectly clear she doesn’t lay eggs.   
Can it be she’s simply in love with herself? 
Her eye obsidian, eye of the world,
at night she watches the stars drop from shelf   
to shelf, to minor études she unfurls 
in her head. By day she hunts and re-pecks   
the pinprick holes of her intricate sketch.   
If she’s done by dusk the first stars can rise.

Stella is sick, and in that sick-bed lies Sweetness, that breathes and pants as oft as she; And grace, sick too, such fine conclusions tries That sickness brags itself best graced to be.     Beauty is sick, but sick in so fair guise That in that paleness beauty’s white we see; And joy, which is inseparate from these eyes, Stella now learns (strange case!) to weep in thee.    Love moves thy pain, and like a faithful page, As thy looks stir, runs up and down, to make All folks prest at thy will thy pain to assuage; Nature with care sweats for her darling’s sake,    Knowing worlds pass, ere she enough can find    Of such heaven stuff, to clothe so heavenly mind.

Where be the roses gone, which sweetened so our eyes?     Where those red cheeks, which oft with fair increase did frame     The height of honor in the kindly badge of shame? Who hath the crimson weeds stolen from my morning skies? How doth the color vade of those vermilion dyes,     Which Nature's self did make, and self engrained the same!     I would know by what right this paleness overcame That hue, whose force my heart still unto thraldom ties?     Galen's adoptive sons, who by a beaten way     Their judgements hackney on, the fault on sickness lay; But feeling proof makes me say they mistake it far:     It is but love, which makes his paper perfect white     To write therein more fresh the story of delight, Whiles beauty's reddest ink Venus for him doth stir.

Where is that dainty cheer     Thou told’st mine eyes should help their famished case?     But thou art gone, now that self-felt disgrace Doth make me most to wish thy comfort near.     But here I do store of fair ladies meet,     Who may with charm of conversation sweet Make in my heavy mould new thoughts to grow:     Sure they prevail as much with me, as he     That bade his friend, but then new maimed, to be Merry with him, and not think of his woe.


^^EOP^^

Stella, since thou so right a princess art Of all the powers which life bestows on me, There ere by them aught undertaken be They first resort unto that sovereign part; Sweet, for a while give respite to my heart, Which pants as though it still should leap to thee, And on my thoughts give thy lieutenancy To this great cause, which needs both use and art, And as a queen, who from her presence sends Whom she employs, dismiss from thee my wit, Till it have wrought what thy own will attends. On servants’ shame oft master’s blame doth sit. Oh let not fools in me thy works reprove, And scorning say, “See what it is to love.”


^^EOP^^

Alas, have I not pain enough, my friend, Upon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tire Than did on him who first stale down the fire, While Love on me doth all his quiver spend, But with your rhubarb words you must contend To grieve me worse, in saying that Desire Doth plunge my well-formed soul even in the mire Of sinful thoughts, which do in ruin end? If that be sin which doth the manners frame, Well stayed with truth in word and faith of deed, Ready of wit, and fearing naught but shame; If that be sin which in fixed hearts doth breed A loathing of all loose unchastity, Then love is sin, and let me sinful be.


^^EOP^^

Not at first sight, nor with a dribbèd shot,    Love gave the wound which while I breathe will bleed:    But known worth did in mine of time proceed, Till by degrees it had full conquest got. I saw, and liked; I liked, but lovèd not;    I loved, but straight did not what love decreed:    At length to love’s decrees I, forced, agreed, Yet with repining at so partial lot.    Now even that footstep of lost liberty Is gone, and now like slave-born Muscovite I call it praise to suffer tyranny; And now employ the remnant of my wit    To make myself believe that all is well,    While with a feeling skill I paint my hell.


^^EOP^^

Your words my friend (right healthful caustics) blame My young mind marred, whom Love doth windlass so, That mine own writings like bad servants show My wits, quick in vain thoughts, in virtue lame, That Plato I read for nought, but if he tame Such coltish gyres, that to my birth I owe Nobler desires, least else that friendly foe, Great expectation, wear a train of shame. For since mad March great promise made of me, If now the May of my years much decline, What can be hoped my harvest time will be? Sure you say well, your wisdom’s golden mine Dig deep with learning’s spade, now tell me this, Hath this world ought so fair as Stella is?


^^EOP^^

The wisest scholar of the wight most wise By Phoebus’ doom, with sugared sentence says That Virtue, if it once met with our eyes, Strange flames of love it in our souls would raise; But, for that man with pain this truth descries, While he each thing in sense’s balance weighs, And so nor will nor can behold those skies Which inward sun to heroic mind displays, Virtue of late, with virtuous care to stir Love of herself, takes Stella’s shape, that she To mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her. It is most true, for since I her did see, Virtue’s great beauty in that face I prove, And find th’effect, for I do burn in love.


^^EOP^^

What, have I thus betrayed my liberty? Can those black beams such burning marks engrave In my free side? or am I born a slave, Whose neck becomes such yoke of tyranny? Or want I sense to feel my misery? Or sprite, disdain of such disdain to have? Who for long faith, though daily help I crave, May get no alms but scorn of beggary. Virtue, awake! Beauty but beauty is; I may, I must, I can, I will, I do Leave following that which it is gain to miss. Let her go. Soft, but here she comes. Go to, Unkind, I love you not! O me, that eye Doth make my heart give to my tongue the lie!


^^EOP^^

Soul’s joy, bend not those morning stars from me, Where virtue is made strong by beauty’s might, Where love is chasteness, pain doth learn delight, And humbleness grows one with majesty. Whatever may ensue, O let me be Co-partner of the riches of that sight; Let not mine eyes be hell-driv’n from that light; O look, O shine, O let me die and see. For though I oft my self of them bemoan, That through my heart their beamy darts be gone, Whose cureless wounds even now most freshly bleed, Yet since my death wound is already got, Dear killer, spare not they sweet cruel shot; A kind of grace it is to slay with speed.


^^EOP^^

I on my horse, and Love on me, doth try Our horsemanships, while by strange work I prove A horseman to my horse, a horse to Love, And now man’s wrongs in me, poor beast, descry. The reins wherewith my rider doth me tie Are humbled thoughts, which bit of reverence move, Curbed in with fear, but with gilt boss above Of hope, which makes it seem fair to the eye. The wand is will; thou, fancy, saddle art, Girt fast by memory; and while I spur My horse, he spurs with sharp desire to my heart; He sits me fast, however I do stir; And now hath made me to his hand so right That in the manage myself takes delight.


^^EOP^^

It is most true, that eyes are formed to serve The inward light; and that the heavenly part Ought to be king, from whose rules who do swerve, Rebels to Nature, strive for their own smart.     It is most true, what we call Cupid’s dart, An image is, which for ourselves we carve; And, fools, adore in temple of our heart, Till that good god make Church and churchman starve.     True, that true beauty virtue is indeed, Whereof this beauty can be but a shade, Which elements with mortal mixture breed; True, that on earth we are but pilgrims made,     And should in soul up to our country move; True; and yet true, that I must Stella love.


^^EOP^^

A strife is grown between Virtue and Love, While each pretends that Stella must be his: Her eyes, her lips, her all, saith Love, do this, Since they do wear his badge, most firmly prove. But Virtue thus that title doth disprove, That Stella (O dear name) that Stella is That virtuous soul, sure heir of heav’nly bliss; Not this fair outside, which our hearts doth move. And therefore, though her beauty and her grace Be Love’s indeed, in Stella’s self he may By no pretense claim any manner place. Well, Love, since this demur our suit doth stay, Let Virtue have that Stella's self; yet thus,Let Virtue but that body grant to us.

Nor so ambitious am I, as to frame A nest for my young praise in laurel tree: In truth I sweare, I wish not there should be Graved in mine epitaph a Poet’s name: Nay if I would, could I just title make, That any laud to me thereof should grow, Without my plumes from others’ wings I take. For nothing from my wit or will doth flow, Since all my words thy beauty doth endite, And love doth hold my hand, and makes me write.

Of my solitude
Has found its niche
In this kitchen
Where I do not eat
Where the bathtub stands

Words filled with ice and fear,
Nightflares and fogginess,

Below the gardens and the darkening pines
The living water sinks among the stones,
Sinking yet foaming till the snowy tones
Merge with the fog drawn landward in dim lines.
The cloud dissolves among the flowering vines,
And now the definite mountain-side disowns
The fluid world, the immeasurable zones.
Then white oblivion swallows all designs. 
But still the rich confusion of the sea,
Unceasing voice, sombre and solacing,
Rises through veils of silence past the trees;
In restless repetition bound, yet free,
Wave after wave in deluge fresh releasing
An ancient speech, hushed in tremendous ease.

Enclosure, steam-heated; a trial casket.
You are here; your name on a postal box;
entrance into another place like vapor.
No one knows you. No one speaks to you.
All of their cocks stare down their pant legs
at the ground. Their cunts are blind. They
barely let you through the check-out line.
Have a nice day. Plastic or paper? 
Are you origami? A paper folded swan,
like the ones you made when you were ten?
When you saw the constellations, lying
on your back in the wet grass,
the soapy pear blossoms drifting
and wasting, and those stars, the burned out ones
whose light was still coming in waves;
your body was too slight.
How could it hold such mass?
Still on your lips the taste of something. 
All night you waited for morning, all morning
for afternoon, all afternoon for night;
and still the longing sings.
Oh, paper bird with folded wings.

At night the states
I forget them or I wish I was there

          hard time remembering
any of their names
your being beautiful belongs
          to nothing
I don’t believe they should

somehow let you go

and when you go down to
          Washington
witness how perfectly anything
          in particular
sheets of thoughts what a waste
          of sheets at
night. I remember something
          about an
up-to-date theory of time. I
          have my
own white rose for I have
          done
something well but I’m not
          clear
what it is. Weathered, perhaps
          but that’s
never done. What’s done is
          perfection.

you do call out your name

there is a man whose face
          changes continually
but I will never, something
          I will
never with regard to it or
          never regard
I will regard yours tomorrow
I will wear purple will I
and call my name 
At night the states
you who are alive, you who are dead
when I love you alone all night and
          that is what I do
until I could never write from your
          being enough
I don’t want that trick of making
          it be coaxed from
the words not tonight I want it
          coaxed from
myself but being not that. But I’d
          feel more
comfortable about it being words
          if it
were if that’s what it were for these
          are the
States where what words are true
          are words
Not myself. Montana, Illinois.

for Edward Hirsch



Like a distant singing, like a finger sizzling   
for just one moment on the iron, it almost   
hurts. Almost. But then something pulls   
away, and the smooth belly of evening
slides over the earth; the pines and the spaniels   
stop howling and suddenly drop off to sleep.   
While the air is numb with the drowsiness   
of clouds, the needle sails free of the scars   
on the record and the record player lifts   
its artificial arm! This hurts.
But then a boy lays his cards on his bedspread   
the way a sailor spreads his sails   
on the sand, and even this reminds me   
of tables being set, of a woman calling   
and calling her children through blistered   
hands. Then something lets go,
and in her left palm she sees her own eyes,   
and in her right the evening’s first star   
pulls her toward the distant
singing of the sky. Then something else   
lets go; the long sheet of night
winds slowly through the pines.   
Here and there the lights
go up, like a shy applauding.

Alexandria, 1954



When my grandfather came back
from his swim, battered this time
by the treacherous currents, the rocks
jutting out of the water like knives, 
my sister and I sidled into his room
thinking the house too quiet
and saw him like a hurt beast
standing by his bed, naked, wet. 
My grandmother was kneeling, toweling his calves,
my mother was mixing a poultice.
“Look at his bruises,” my sister was whispering,
“and the veins like swollen rivers.” 
We kept inching toward him
while my grandmother daubed him with cream
and wound him in a bedsheet
and made him odder than any dream of him.
“Children,” she said turning toward us,
“let him sleep, this is your grandfather.” 
We hurried away, having said
not a word to him, nor he to us,
though our eyes had never left his body
and we ached to touch him, brush
our fingertips along the webs of cuts
and discolorations in his pale skin. 
All day we wished he would somehow rise
like a true ghost, the sheet ruffling in the drafts;
“Grandfather,” we whispered at his closed door,
“come to us, bring us your stories,” 
but when the last lights were put out that night
and the dark spread about us like a purple bruise
we wished we had never wished what we had,
every waft of wind had a rustle to it
and the sound of water was deep in our ears 
and by morning, he had become for us
in his shut room the ghostliest of imaginings,
and keeping our distance, we waited
only for his door to suddenly swing forth
and reveal him standing either healed
and smiling and unstrange, or what seemed
likelier to us now, about to change our lives.

for Gerald Stern



At sixteen I was so vulnerable to every influence
That the overcast light, making the trash of addicts & sunbathers suddenly clearer
On the paths of the city park, seemed death itself spreading its shade   
Over the leaves, the swan boats, the gum wrappers, and the quarreling ducks.
It took nothing more than a few clouds straying over the sun,
And I would begin falling through myself like an anvil or a girl's comb or a feather
Dropped, tossed, or spiraling by pure chance down the silent air shaft of a warehouse,
The spiderweb in one fourth-floor window catching, in that moment, the sunset.
For in such a moment, to fall was to be simplified & pure,
With a neck snapped like a stem instead
Of whoever I turned out to be,
Wiping the window glass clear with one cuff
To gaze out at a two-hundred-year-old live oak tethering
The courtyard to its quiet,
The tree so old it has outlived even its life as a cliché,
And has survived, with no apparent effort, every boy who marched, like a wilderness
Himself, past it on his way to enlist in Lee’s army,
And now it swells gently in the mist & the early sunlight.
So who saved me? And for what purpose?
Beneath the small angel cut from cheap stone, there was nothing   
But my name & the years 1947-1949,
And the tense, muggy little quiet of a place where singing ends,
And where there is only the leftover colored chalk & the delusions of voodoo,
The small bones & X’s on stones signifying the practitioner’s absence,   
Entirely voluntary, from the gnat swirl & humming of time;
To which the chalked X on stone is the final theory; it is even illiterate.   
It is not even a lock of hair on a grave. It is not even
The small crowd of roughnecks at Poe’s funeral, nor the blind drunkard   
Laughing there, the white of his eyes the unfurling of a cold surf below a cliff—
Which is the blank wave sprawl of fact receding under the cries of gulls—
Which is not enough.  * 
I should rush out to my office & eat a small, freckled apple leftover   
From 1970 & entirely wizened & rotted by sunlight now,
Then lay my head on my desk & dream again of horses grazing, riderless & still saddled,
Under the smog of the freeway cloverleaf & within earshot of the music waltzing with itself out
Of the topless bars & laundromats of East L.A. 
I should go back again & try to talk my friend out of his diet
Of methamphetamine & vodka yogurts & the look of resignation spreading over his face
Like the gray shade of a tree spreading over a sleeper in the park— 
For it is all or nothing in this life, for there is no other.
And without beauty, Bakunin will go on making his forlorn & unreliable little bombs in the cold, & Oswald will adjust   
The lenses on the scope of his rifle, the one
Friend he has carried with him all the way out of his childhood,
The silent wood of its stock as musical to him in its grain as any violin.   
This must have been what they meant,
Lincoln & Whitman, joining hands one overcast spring afternoon   
To stroll together through the mud of Washington at the end   
Of the war, the tears welling up in both their eyes,
Neither one of them saying a word, their hands clasped tightly together   
As they walk for block after block past
The bay, sorrel, chestnut, and dapple-gray tail swish of horses,
And waiting carriages, & neither one of them noticing, as they stroll & weave,
The harness gall on the winters of a mare,
Nor the gnats swarming over it, alighting now on the first trickle of blood uncaking from the sore;
And the underfed rib cage showing through its coat each time it inhales   
Like the tines of a rake combing the battleground to overturn   
Something that might identify the dead at Antietam.
The rake keeps flashing in the late autumn light.
And Bakunin, with a face impassive as a barn owl’s & never straying from the one true text of flames?
And Lincoln, absentmindedly trying to brush away the wart on his cheek   
As he dresses for the last time,
As he fumbles for a pair of cuff links in a silk-lined box,
As he anticipates some pure & frivolous pleasure,
As he dreams for a moment, & is a woman for a moment,
And in his floating joy has no idea what is going to happen to him in the next hour?
And Oswald dozing over a pamphlet by Trotsky in the student union?   
Oh live oak, thoughtless beauty in a century of pulpy memoirs,   
Spreading into the early morning sunlight
As if it could never be otherwise, as if it were all a pure proclamation of leaves & a final quiet—  * 
But it’s all or nothing in this life; it’s smallpox, quicklime, & fire.
It’s the extinct whistling of an infantry; it is all the faded rosettes of blood
Turning into this amnesia of billboards & the ceaseless hunh? of traffic.   
It goes on & I go with it; it spreads into the sun & air & throws out a fast shade
That will never sleep, and I go with it; it breaks Lincoln & Poe into small drops of oil spreading
Into endless swirls on the water, & I recognize the pattern:  * 
There there now, Nothing.
Stop your sniveling. Stop sifting dirt through your fingers into your glass of milk,
A milk still white as stone; whiter even. Why don’t you finish it?
We’d better be getting on our way soon, sweet Nothing.
I’ll buy you something pretty from the store.
I’ll let you wear the flower in your hair even though you can only vanish entirely underneath its brown, implacable petals.
Stop your sniveling. I can almost see the all night diner looming   
Up ahead, with its lights & its flashing sign a testimony to failure.
I can almost see our little apartment under the freeway overpass, the cups on the mantle rattling continually—
The Mojave one way; the Pacific the other.
At least we’ll have each other’s company.
And it’s not as if you held your one wing, tattered as it was, in contempt   
For being only one. It’s not as if you were frivolous.
It’s not like that. It’s not like that at all.
Riding beside me, your seat belt around your invisible waist. Sweet Nothing.   
Sweet, sweet Nothing.

Suddenly, I stopped thinking about Love,
after so many years of only that,
after thinking that nothing else mattered. 
And what was I thinking of when I stopped
thinking about Love? Death, of course—what else
could take Love’s place? What else could hold such force? 
I thought about how far away Death once
had seemed, how unexpected that it could
happen to someone I knew quite well, 
how impossible that this should be the
normal thing, as natural as frost and
winter. I thought about the way we’d aged, 
how skin fell into wrinkles, how eyes grew
dim; then (of course) my love, I thought of you.


^^EOP^^

This is how it was:
they had their own churches, their own schools,
schoolbuses, football teams, bands and majorettes,
separate restaurants, in all the public places
their own bathrooms, at the doctor’s
their own waiting room, in the Tribune 
a column for their news, in the village
a neighborhood called Sugar Hill,
uneven rows of unresponsive houses
that took the maids back in each afternoon—
in our homes used the designated door,
on Trailways sat in the back, and at the movie
paid at a separate entrance, stayed upstairs.
Saturdays, a double feature drew the local kids
as the town bulged, families surfacing
for groceries, medicine and wine,
the black barber, white clerks in the stores—crowds
lined the sidewalks, swirled through the courthouse yard,
around the stone soldier and the flag, 
and still I never saw them on the street.
It seemed a chivalric code
laced the milk: you’d try not to look
and they would try to be invisible.
Once, on my way to the creek,
I went without permission to the tenants’
log cabin near the barns, and when Aunt Susie
opened the door, a cave yawned, and beyond her square,
leonine, freckled face, in the hushed interior,
Joe White lumbered up from the table, six unfolding
feet of him, dark as a gun-barrel, his head bent
to clear the chinked rafters, and I caught
the terrifying smell of sweat and grease,
smell of the woodstove, nightjar, straw mattress—
This was rural Piedmont, upper south;
we lived on a farm but not in poverty.
When finally we got our own TV, the evening news
with its hooded figures of the Ku Klux Klan
seemed like another movie—King Solomon’s Mines,
the serial of Atlantis in the sea.
By then I was thirteen,
and no longer went to movies to see movies.
The downstairs forged its attentions forward,
toward the lit horizon, but leaning a little
to one side or the other, arranging the pairs
that would own the county, stores and farms, everything
but easy passage out of there—
and through my wing-tipped glasses the balcony
took on a sullen glamor: whenever the film
sputtered on the reel, when the music died
and the lights came on, I swiveled my face
up to where they whooped and swore,
to the smoky blue haze and that tribe
of black and brown, licorice, coffee,
taffy, red oak, sweet tea— 
wanting to look, not knowing how to see,
I thought it was a special privilege
to enter the side door, climb the stairs
and scan the even rows below—trained bears
in a pit, herded by the stringent rule,
while they were free, lounging above us,
their laughter pelting down on us like trash.

Mark the first page of the book with a red marker. For,
in the beginning, the wound is invisible.
- Reb Alcé



"What is going on behind this door?" 
    "A book is shedding its leaves." 
    "What is the story of the book?" 
    "Becoming aware of a scream." 
    "I saw rabbis go in." 
    "They are privileged readers. They come in small groups to give us their comments." 
    "Have they read the book?" 
    "They are reading it." 
    "Did they happen by for the fun of it?" 
    "They foresaw the book. They are prepared to encounter it." 
    "Do they know the characters?" 
    "They know our martyrs." 
    "Where is the book set?" 
    "In the book." 
    "Who are you?" 
    "I am the keeper of the house." 
    "Where do you come from?" 
    "I have wandered." 
    "Is Yukel your friend?" 
    "I am like Yukel." 
    "What is your lot?" 
    "To open the book." 
    "Are you in the book?" 
    "My place is at the threshold." 
    "What have you tried to learn?" 
    "I sometimes stop on the road to the sources and question the signs, the world of my ancestors." 
    "You examine recaptured words." 
    "The nights and mornings of the syllables which are mine, yes." 
    "Your mind is wandering." 
    "I have been wandering for two thousand years." 
    "I have trouble following you." 
    "I, too, have often tried to give up." 
    "Do we have a tale here?" 
    "My story has been told so many times." 
    "What is your story?" 
    "Ours, insofar as it is absent." 
    "I do not understand." 
    "Speaking tortures me." 
    "Where are you?" 
    "In what I say." 
    "What is your truth?" 
    "What lacerates me." 
    "And your salvation?" 
    "Forgetting what I said." 
    "May I come in? It is getting dark." 
    "In each word there burns a wick." 
    "May I come in? It is getting dark around my soul." 
    "It is dark around me, too." 
    "What can you do for me?" 
    "Your share of luck is in yourself." 
    "Writing for the sake of writing does nothing but show contempt." 
    "Man is a written bond and place." 
    "I hate what is said in place I have left behind." 
    "You trade in the future, which is immediately translated. What you have left is you without you." 
    "You oppose me to myself. How could I ever win this fight?" 
    "Defeat is the price agreed on." 
    "You are a Jew, and you talk like one." 
    "The four letters JUIF which designate my origin are your four fingers. You can use your thumb to crush me." 
    "You are a Jew, and you talk like one. But I am cold. It is dark. Let me come into the house." 
    "There is a lamp on my table. And the house is in the book." 
    "So I will live in the house after all." 
    "You will follow the book, whose every page is an abyss where the wing shines with the name."

The last time I saw Paul Castle
it was printed in gold on the wall
above the showers in the boys’
locker room, next to the school
record for the mile. I don’t recall
his time, but the year was 1968
and I can look across the infield
of memory to see him on the track,
legs flashing, body bending slightly
beyond the pack of runners at his back. 
He couldn’t spare a word for me,
two years younger, junior varsity,
and hardly worth the waste of breath.
He owned the hallways, a cool blonde
at his side, and aimed his interests
further down the line than we could guess. 
Now, reading the name again,
I see us standing in the showers,
naked kids beneath his larger,
comprehensive force—the ones who trail
obscurely, in the wake of the swift,
like my shadow on this gleaming wall.

God with honour hang your head, Groom, and grace you, bride, your bed With lissome scions, sweet scions, Out of hallowed bodies bred.  Each be other’s comfort kind: Déep, déeper than divined, Divine charity, dear charity, Fast you ever, fast bind.  Then let the March tread our ears: I to him turn with tears   Who to wedlock, his wonder wedlock, Déals tríumph and immortal years.

The drunk mechanic is happy to be in the ditch.
From the tavern, five minutes through the dark field
and you’re home. But first, there’s the cool grass
to enjoy, and the mechanic will sleep here till dawn.
A few feet away, the red and black sign that rises
from the field: if you’re too close, you can’t read it,
it’s that big. At this hour, it’s still wet dew.
Later, the streets will cover it with dust, as it covers
the bushes. The mechanic, beneath it, stretches in sleep. 
Silence is total. Shortly, in the warmth of the sun,
one car after another will pass, waking the dust.
At the top of the hill they slow down for the curve,
then plunge down the slope. A few of the cars
stop at the garage, in the dust, to drink a few liters.
At this time of the morning, the mechanics, still dazed,
will be sitting on oil drums, waiting for work.
It’s a pleasure to spend the morning sitting in the shade,
where the stink of oil’s cut with the smell of green,
of tobacco, of wine, and where work comes to them,
right to the door. Sometimes it’s even amusing:
peasants’ wives come to scold them, blaming the garage
for the traffic—it frightens the animals and women—
and for making their husbands look sullen: quick trips
down the hill into Turin that lighten their wallets.
Between laughing and selling gas, one of them will pause:
these fields, it’s plain to see, are covered with road dust,
if you try to sit on the grass, it’ll drive you away.
On the hillside, there’s a vineyard he prefers to all others,
and in the end he’ll marry that vineyard and the sweet girl
who comes with it, and he’ll go out in the sun to work,
but now with a hoe, and his neck will turn brown,
and he’ll drink wine pressed on fall evenings from his own grapes. 
Cars pass during the night, too, but more quietly,
so quiet the drunk in the ditch hasn’t woken. At night
they don’t raise much dust, and the beams of their headlights,
as they round the curve, reveal in full the sign in the field.
Near dawn, they glide cautiously along, you can’t hear a thing
except maybe the breeze, and from the top of the hill
they disappear into the plain, sinking in shadows.

God prosper long our noble Queen,        And long may she reign! Maclean he tried to shoot her,        But it was all in vain.  For God He turned the ball aside        Maclean aimed at her head; And he felt very angry        Because he didn’t shoot her dead.  There’s a divinity that hedges a king,        And so it does seem, And my opinion is, it has hedged        Our most gracious Queen.  Maclean must be a madman,        Which is obvious to be seen, Or else he wouldn’t have tried to shoot        Our most beloved Queen.  Victoria is a good Queen,        Which all her subjects know, And for that God has protected her        From all her deadly foes.  She is noble and generous,        Her subjects must confess; There hasn’t been her equal        Since the days of good Queen Bess.  Long may she be spared to roam        Among the bonnie Highland floral, And spend many a happy day        In the palace of Balmoral.  Because she is very kind        To the old women there, And allows them bread, tea, and sugar,        And each one to get a share.  And when they know of her coming,        Their hearts feel overjoy’d, Because, in general, she finds work        For men that’s unemploy’d.  And she also gives the gipsies money        While at Balmoral, I’ve been told, And, mind ye, seldom silver,        But very often gold.  I hope God will protect her        By night and by day, At home and abroad,        When she’s far away.  May He be as a hedge around her,        As He’s been all along, And let her live and die in peace        Is the end of my song.

Ventriloquy
is the mother tongue. 
Can you colonize rejection   
by phrasing your request,
                                       “Me want?” 
Song: “I’m not a baby.   
         Wa, Wa, Wa. 
         I’m not a baby.   
         Wa, Wa, Wa. 
         I’m crazy   
         like you.” 
The “you”
in the heart of   
molecule and ridicule. 
Marks resembling   
the holes 
in dead leaves
define the thing (moth wing). 
That flutter
of indifference,
                         feigned? 
But if lapses    are the dens 
strategy aims   
to conceal, 
then you don’t know   
what you’re asking.

I work all day, and get half-drunk at night.   
Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare.   
In time the curtain-edges will grow light.   
Till then I see what’s really always there:   
Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,   
Making all thought impossible but how   
And where and when I shall myself die.   
Arid interrogation: yet the dread
Of dying, and being dead,
Flashes afresh to hold and horrify. 
The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse   
—The good not done, the love not given, time   
Torn off unused—nor wretchedly because   
An only life can take so long to climb
Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;   
But at the total emptiness for ever,
The sure extinction that we travel to
And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,   
Not to be anywhere,
And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true. 
This is a special way of being afraid
No trick dispels. Religion used to try,
That vast moth-eaten musical brocade
Created to pretend we never die,
And specious stuff that says No rational being  Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing
That this is what we fear—no sight, no sound,   
No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,   
Nothing to love or link with,
The anaesthetic from which none come round. 
And so it stays just on the edge of vision,   
A small unfocused blur, a standing chill   
That slows each impulse down to indecision.   
Most things may never happen: this one will,   
And realisation of it rages out
In furnace-fear when we are caught without   
People or drink. Courage is no good:
It means not scaring others. Being brave   
Lets no one off the grave.
Death is no different whined at than withstood. 
Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.   
It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,   
Have always known, know that we can’t escape,   
Yet can’t accept. One side will have to go.
Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring   
In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring
Intricate rented world begins to rouse.
The sky is white as clay, with no sun.
Work has to be done.
Postmen like doctors go from house to house.

I know my leaving in the breakfast table mess.   
Bowl spills into bowl: milk and bran, bread crust   
crumbled. You push me back into bed. 
More “honey” and “baby.”
Breath you tell my ear circles inside me,   
curls a damp wind and runs the circuit   
of my limbs. I interrogate the air, 
smell Murphy’s Oil Soap, dog kibble.
No rose. No patchouli swelter. And your mouth—   
sesame, olive. The nudge of your tongue
behind my top teeth. 
To entirely finish is water entering water.   
Which is the cup I take away? 
More turning me. Less your arms reaching   
around my back. You ask my ear
where I have been and my body answers,   
all over kingdom come.

It seemed as if we did not sleep
One wink that night; I was sighing deep.
The cruellest judge in the costliest court
Could not condemn a night so short.
We had the light out, but I know,
Each time I turned, a radiant glow
Suffused the room, and shining snow
Alit from Heaven’s candle-fires
Illuminated our desires. 
But the last time I held her, strong,
Excited, closest, very long,
Something started to go wrong.
The edge of dawn’s despotic veil
Showed at the eastern window-pale
And there it was,—the morning light!
Gwen was seized with a fearful fright,
Became an apparition, cried,
“Get up, go now with God, go hide! 
“Love is a salt, a gall, a rue,
A vinegar-vintage. Dos y Ddw,
Vaya con Dios, quickly, too!”
“Ah, not yet, never yet, my love;
The stars and moon still shine above.”
“Then why do the raucous ravens talk
With such a loud insistent squawk?”
“Crows always cry like that, when fleas
Nibble their ankles, nip their knees.” 
“And why do the dogs yip, yammer, yell?”
“They think they’ve caught a fox’s smell.”
“Poet, the wisdom of a fool
Offers poor counsel as a rule.
Open the door, open it wide
As fast as you can, and leap outside.
The dogs are fierce when they get untied.”
“The woods are only a bound from here,
And I can outjump a deer, my dear!” 
“But tell me, best beloved of men,
Will you come again? Will you come again?”
“Gwen, you know I’m your nightingale,
And I’ll be with you, without fail,
When the cloud is cloak, and the dark is sky,
And when the night comes, so will I.”

From here groomed fields and clumps of trees,   
a silo of corrugated tin and a white barn blur. 
Unseasonable cool days,

and I could look out and imagine Denmark.   
But I’m in my office three floors up.

In Armenian there’s a word—garod—rhymes with “maud.”

What’s happening in Spitak and Sarajevo and the West Bank   
is splayed like the cortex of a silicon chip in the fuzzy air. 
Maria, the physician from Armenia, was 25 & had one plastic arm
and one real arm. I met her in East Hampton on the deck of a house on the dunes.
After the earthquake she had no husband,
no parents, and only one child. 
“I’m in a good mood today,” she said, “let’s talk about   
something else.” I poured her an Amstel Light.

The coolness intrudes—
month of wind-sprints and retching for the coach.   
It comes back like nerve ends after surgery. 
Along a country road cicadas rattling.
Chicory and sweet pea intruding on the ripe barley. 
I picked up some seed packs from a junk shop on Rt. 20,   
a tomato blazed in red ink/ 1926, Fredonia, N.Y.  
8/11 
What’s between us? The red ink of the tomato? 
How does an image stay? Or is it always aftermath?
The way deep black reflected the most light in Talbot’s first calotypes. 
But garod: tongue of a snake,   
meaning exile, longing for home. 
Thomas Wedgwood got images by getting sunlight
to pass through things onto paper brushed with silver nitrate: 
wings of a dragonfly, the spine of an oak leaf—
fugitive photograms. But he couldn’t stop the sun   
until it turned the paper black. 
Stop the light before it goes too far? 
Or is desire what garod means?   
Longing for a native place.

Maria said she was learning how to connect nerve endings   
in the hand so hands and arms would work again.
There were so many in Armenia without working hands and arms. 
At the end of each dendrite is a blurred line   
like the horizon I’m squinting. 
Image of the other:
light-arrested; not the image of ourselves.

After digging scallions one day Dickinson defined freedom:    Captivity’s consciousness, so’s liberty. 
Maybe garod is about the longing for the native place

I love the brute force of silence in Roger Fenton’s Sebastopol from Cathcart’s Hill, 1855. The Crimean inner war. 
The artlessness of silver is like my tongue in your wet space,   
or like the news photos that bring us the pressure of disaster. 
Beloved topography, garod then must mean yearning. 
Is that how we loved under the rattling Nippon porcelain,   
in the light calotyped by the fire escape?  
8/25 
garod: the grain chute that spills   
into a dark barn which is endless, 
like the self when it’s out of reach. 
Are we so lonely that a constellation   
could blacken and fill up that same barn, 
and that be me or you? 
But still we’re piss and oats and stock in there.   
We’re like civet, who wouldn’t love it.

The lasses aw wonder’d what Willy cud seeIn yen that was dark and hard featur’d leyke me;And they wonder’d ay mair when they talk’d o’ my wit,And slily telt Willy that cudn’t be it:But Willy he laugh’d, and he meade me his weyfe,And whea was mair happy thro’ aw his lang leyfe?It’s e’en my great comfort, now Willy is geane,The he offen said— nae place was leyke his awn heame!
I mind when I carried my wark to yon steyleWhere Willy was deykin, the time to beguile,He wad fling me a daisy to put i’ my breast,And I hammer’d my noddle to mek out a jest.But merry or grave, Willy often wad tellThere was nin o’ the leave that was leyke my awn sel;And he spak what he thout, for I’d hardly a plackWhen we married, and nobbet ae gown to my back.
When the clock had struck eight I expected him heame,And wheyles went to meet him as far as Dumleane;Of aw hours it telt eight was dearest to me,But now when it streykes there’s a tear i’ my ee.O Willy! dear Willy! it never can beThat age, time, or death, can divide thee and me!For that spot on earth that’s aye dearest to me,Is the turf that has cover’d my Willy frae me!

All clocks are clouds. 
Parts are greater than the whole. 
A philosopher is starving in a rooming house, while it rains outside. 
He regards the self as just another sign. 
Winter roses are invisible. 
Late ice sometimes sings.   A and Not-A are the same. 
My dog does not know me. 
Violins, like dreams, are suspect. 
I come from Kolophon, or perhaps some small island. 
The strait has frozen, and people are walking—a few skating—across it. 
On the crescent beach, a drowned deer.  
A woman with one hand, her thighs around your neck. 
The world is all that is displaced. 
Apples in a stall at the streetcorner by the Bahnhof, pale yellow to blackish red. 
Memory does not speak. 
Shortness of breath, accompanied by tinnitus. 
The poet’s stutter and the philosopher’s.  
The self is assigned to others. 
A room for which, at all times, the moon remains visible. 
Leningrad cafe: a man missing the left side of his face. 
Disappearance of the sun from the sky above Odessa. 
True description of that sun. 
A philosopher lies in a doorway, discussing the theory of colors  
with himself 
the theory of self with himself, the concept of number, eternal return, the sidereal pulse 
logic of types, Buridan sentences, the lekton. 
Why now that smoke off the lake? 
Word and things are the same. 
Many times white ravens have I seen.  
That all planes are infinite, by extension. 
She asks, Is there a map of these gates? 
She asks, Is this one called Passages, or is that one to the west? 
Thus released, the dark angels converse with the angels of light. 
They are not angels. 
Something else.

Autumn is always too early.
The peonies are still blooming, bees   
are still working out ideal states,
and the cold bayonets of autumn   
suddenly glint in the fields and the wind
rages. 
What is its origin? Why should it destroy   
dreams, arbors, memories?
The alien enters the hushed woods,   
anger advancing, insinuating plague;   
woodsmoke, the raucous howls
of Tatars. 
Autumn rips away leaves, names,   
fruit, it covers the borders and paths,   
extinguishes lamps and tapers; young   
autumn, lips purpled, embraces   
mortal creatures, stealing
their existence. 
Sap flows, sacrificed blood,
wine, oil, wild rivers,
yellow rivers swollen with corpses,
the curse flowing on: mud, lava, avalanche,   
gush. 
Breathless autumn, racing, blue
knives glinting in her glance.
She scythes names like herbs with her keen   
sickle, merciless in her blaze
and her breath. Anonymous letter, terror,   
Red Army.

I walk outside the stone wall
Looking into the park at night
As armed trees frisk a windfall
Down paths that lampposts light

A full year passed (the seasons keep me honest)
since I last noticed this same commotion.
Who knew God was an abstract expressionist? 
I’m asking myself—the very question
I asked last year, staring out at this array
of racing colors, then set in motion 
by the chance invasion of a Steller’s jay.
Is this what people mean by speed of light?
My usually levelheaded mulberry tree 
hurling arrows everywhere in sight—
its bow: the out-of-control Virginia creeper
my friends say I should do something about, 
whose vermilion went at least a full shade deeper
at the provocation of the upstart blue,
the leaves (half green, half gold) suddenly hyper 
in savage competition with that red and blue—
tohubohu returned, in living color.
Kandinsky: where were you when I needed you? 
My attempted poem would lie fallow a year;
I was so busy focusing on the desert’s
stinginess with everything but rumor. 
No place even for the spectrum’s introverts—
rose, olive, gray—no pigment at all—
and certainly no room for shameless braggarts 
like the ones that barge in here every fall
and make me feel like an unredeemed failure
even more emphatically than usual. 
And here they are again, their fleet allure
still more urgent this time—the desert’s gone;
I’m through with it, want something fuller— 
why shouldn’t a person have a little fun,
some utterly unnecessary extravagance?
Which was—at least I think it was—God’s plan 
when He set up (such things are never left to chance)
that one split-second assignation
with genuine, no-kidding-around omnipotence 
what, for lack of better words, I’m calling vision.
You breathe in, and, for once, there’s something there.
Just when you thought you’d learned some resignation, 
there’s real resistance in the nearby air
until the entire universe is swayed.
Even that desert of yours isn’t quite so bare 
and God’s not nonexistent; He’s just been waylaid
by a host of what no one could’ve foreseen.
He’s got plans for you: this red-gold-green parade 
is actually a fairly detailed outline.
David never needed one, but he’s long dead
and God could use a little recognition. 
He promises. It won’t go to His head
and if you praise Him properly (an autumn psalm!
Why didn’t I think of that?) you’ll have it made. 
But while it’s true that my Virginia creeper praises Him,
its palms and fingers crimson with applause,
that the local breeze is weaving Him a diadem, 
inspecting my tree’s uncut gold for flaws,
I came to talk about the way that violet-blue
sprang the greens and reds and yellows 
into action: actual motion. I swear it’s true
though I’m not sure I ever took it in.
Now I’d be prepared, if some magician flew 
into my field of vision, to realign
that dazzle out my window yet again.
It’s not likely, but I’m keeping my eyes open 
though I still wouldn’t be able to explain
precisely what happened to these vines, these trees.
It isn’t available in my tradition. 
For this, I would have to be Chinese,
Wang Wei, to be precise, on a mountain,
autumn rain converging on the trees, 
a cassia flower nearby, a cloud, a pine,
washerwomen heading home for the day,
my senses and the mountain so entirely in tune 
that when my stroke of blue arrives, I’m ready.
Though there is no rain here: the air’s shot through
with gold on golden leaves. Wang Wei’s so giddy 
he’s calling back the dead: Li Bai! Du Fu!
Guys! You’ve got to see this—autumn sun!

Mothers of America
                                     let your kids go to the movies!
get them out of the house so they won’t know what you’re up to   
it’s true that fresh air is good for the body
                                                                             but what about the soul   
that grows in darkness, embossed by silvery images
and when you grow old as grow old you must
                                                                                they won’t hate you   
they won’t criticize you they won’t know
                                                                         they’ll be in some glamorous country   
they first saw on a Saturday afternoon or playing hookey 
they may even be grateful to you
                                                            for their first sexual experience   
which only cost you a quarter
                                                       and didn’t upset the peaceful home   
they will know where candy bars come from
                                                                                 and gratuitous bags of popcorn   
as gratuitous as leaving the movie before it’s over
with a pleasant stranger whose apartment is in the Heaven on Earth Bldg   
near the Williamsburg Bridge
                                                       oh mothers you will have made the little tykes
so happy because if nobody does pick them up in the movies   
they won’t know the difference
                                                         and if somebody does it’ll be sheer gravy   
and they’ll have been truly entertained either way
instead of hanging around the yard
                                                                 or up in their room
                                                                                                     hating you
prematurely since you won’t have done anything horribly mean yet   
except keeping them from the darker joys
                                                                             it’s unforgivable the latter   
so don’t blame me if you won’t take this advice
                                                                                      and the family breaks up   
and your children grow old and blind in front of a TV set
                                                                                                      seeing   
movies you wouldn’t let them see when they were young

Curtains forcing their will   
against the wind,
children sleep,
exchanging dreams with   
seraphim. The city

subway straps; and
I, an alarm, awake as a   
rumor of war,
lie stretching into dawn,   
unasked and unheeded.

Away above a harborful
                                              of caulkless houses   
among the charley noble chimneypots
                  of a rooftop rigged with clotheslines   
             a woman pastes up sails
                                          upon the wind
hanging out her morning sheets
                                             with wooden pins
                                  O lovely mammal
                                             her nearly naked breasts

                                             when she stretches up   
to hang at last the last of her
                                              so white washed sins   
                  but it is wetly amorous
                                                   and winds itself about her   
                     clinging to her skin
                                                   So caught with arms   
                                                                               upraised   
            she tosses back her head
                                              in voiceless laughter   
    and in choiceless gesture then
                                                 shakes out gold hair 
while in the reachless seascape spaces 
                           between the blown white shrouds    
         stand out the bright steamers

Do you know what’s the unluckiest thing
In the world, a differential grasshopper
Said to me. I paused, I put down the
Diesel grinder I’d been trying to fix,
I turned off the stealth bomber, I faded
Away from the faded away pedals, I put up
Finely embroidered silk panels over the
Faces of the statues, I pulled the green
Vacillating amplifier into the hallway,
I swiveled seven of the chains and
Loosened the bolts in the balcony, I went
Into the barn to unlace the cattle and
Overturn the empty buckets, I put the
White flag on the mailbox, I cut the
Telephone wires, I fed the ducks better
Than I usually feed them, I adjusted the
Faucets so they’d drip a little, I waved
At old Mr. Wiley with his smokeless pipe
And his manpowered plough across the field,
I moved a claypot off of a narrow ledge,
I taped the key to the bulldozer to the
Roof of the canopy, I took the cup of
Auger bits away from the rabbit hutch,   
I put a padlock on the children’s playhouse,
I picked up a stick by the sideyard gate,
I broke it over my knee, I went to the well
To fill a stone pitcher with cool water,   
I let the donkey & the goats go. I took
A ladder to the hayloft and took down a   
Suitcase. I could see across the valley
Down to the river from up there.

When she came into his room he was asleep
and when she touched him, he woke—
her hand on his shoulder, her knee at his mouth,
and in the darkness, she looked like a boy. 
When he tried to sit up she covered his ears
with her hands: “Save ourselves from ourselves,”
she said, and then a wind stirred in the room
as if she’d placed those words in his mouth.

Baby ate a microchip,
Then grabbed a bottle, took a sip.
He swallowed it and made a beep,
And now he’s thinking pretty deep. 
He’s downloading his ABCs
And calculating 1-2-3s.
He’s memorizing useless facts
While doing Daddy’s income tax. 
He’s processing, and now he thrives
On feeding his internal drives.
He’s throwing fits, and now he fights
With ruthless bits and toothless bytes. 
He must be feeling very smug.
But hold on, Baby caught a bug.
Attempting to reboot in haste,   
He accidentally got erased!

He tells me in Bangkok he’s robbed
Because he’s white; in London because he’s black;   
In Barcelona, Jew; in Paris, Arab:
Everywhere and at all times, and he fights back. 
He holds up seven thick little fingers
To show me he’s rated seventh in the world,   
And there’s no passion in his voice, no anger   
In the flat brown eyes flecked with blood. 
He asks me to tell all I can remember
Of my father, his uncle; he talks of the war   
In North Africa and what came after,
The loss of his father, the loss of his brother, 
The windows of the bakery smashed and the fresh bread   
Dusted with glass, the warm smell of rye
So strong he ate till his mouth filled with blood.
“Here they live, here they live and not die,” 
And he points down at his black head ridged   
With black kinks of hair. He touches my hair,   
Tells me I should never disparage
The stiff bristles that guard the head of the fighter. 
Sadly his fingers wander over my face,   
And he says how fair I am, how smooth.   
We stand to end this first and last visit.   
Stiff, 116 pounds, five feet two, 
No bigger than a girl, he holds my shoulders,   
Kisses my lips, his eyes still open,
My imaginary brother, my cousin,
Myself made otherwise by all his pain.

The gaunt thing   
with no organs
creeps along the streets
of Europe, she will
commute, in her feathered bat stomach-gown
with no organs
with sores on her insides
even her head
a vast puschamber   
of pus(sy) memories
with no organs
nothing to make babies
she will be the great witch of euro-american legend
who sucked the life
from some unknown nigger
whose name will be known
but whose substance will not ever   
not even by him
who is dead in a pile of dopeskin 
This bitch killed a friend of mine named Bob Thompson   
a black painter, a giant, once, she reduced
to a pitiful imitation faggot
full of American holes and a monkey on his back   
slapped airplanes
from the empire state building 
May this bitch and her sisters, all of them,   
receive my words
in all their orifices like lye mixed with   
cocola and alaga syrup 
feel this shit, bitches, feel it, now laugh your   
hysterectic laughs
while your flesh burns
and your eyes peel to red mud

To wed, or not to wed; that is the question; Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The bills and house rent of a wedded fortune, Or to say “nit” when she proposes, And by declining cut her. To wed; to smoke No more; And have a wife at home to mend The holes in socks and shirts And underwear and so forth. ’Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To wed for life; To wed; perchance to fight; ay, there’s the rub; For in that married life what fights may come, When we have honeymooning ceased Must give us pause; there’s the respect That makes the joy of single life. For who would bear her mother’s scornful tongue, Canned goods for tea, the dying furnace fire; The pangs of sleepless nights when baby cries; The pain of barking shins upon a chair and Closing waists that button down the back, When he himself might all these troubles shirk With a bare refusal? Who would bundles bear, And grunt and sweat under a shopping load? Who would samples match; buy rats for hair, Cart cheese and crackers home to serve at night For lunch to feed your friends; play pedro After tea; sing rag time songs, amusing Friendly neighbors. Buy garden tools To lend unto the same. Stay home at nights In smoking coat and slippers and slink to bed At ten o’clock to save the light bills? Thus duty does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of matrimony Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of chores; And thus the gloss of marriage fades away, And loses its attraction.

Whose woods these are I think I know ...



The landings had gone wrong; white silk,
like shrouds, covered the woods.
The trees had trapped the flimsy fabric
in their web—everywhere the harnessed bodies
hung—helpless, treading air
like water.
                  We thought to float down
easily—a simple thing
like coming home: feet first,
a welcome from the waiting fields,
a gentle fall in clover. 
We hadn’t counted on this
wilderness, the gusts of wind
that took us over; we were surprised
by the tenacity of branching wood,
its reach, and how impenetrable
the place we left, and thought we knew,
could be.
               Sometimes now, as we sway, unwilling
pendulums that mark the time,
we still can dream
someone will come and cut us down.
There is nothing here but words, the calls
we try the dark with—hoping for a human
ear, response, a rescue party.
But all we hear is other
voices like our own, other bodies
tangled in the lines,
the repetition of a cry from every tree:  I can’t help you, help me.

The burden of hard hitting. Slug away       Like Honus Wagner or like Tyrus Cobb. Else fandom shouteth: “Who said you could play?

Else you shall feel the brunt of fandom’s ire       Biff, bang it, clout it, hit it on the knob— This is the end of every fan’s desire.  The burden of good pitching. Curved or straight.       Or in or out, or haply up or down, To puzzle him that standeth by the plate,       To lessen, so to speak, his bat-renoun:       Like Christy Mathewson or Miner Brown, So pitch that every man can but admire       And offer you the freedom of the town— This is the end of every fan’s desire.

A mighty cheer that possibly denotes That Cub or Pirate fat is in the fire;       Or, as H. James would say, We’ve got their goats— This is the end of every fan’s desire.  The burden of a pennant. O the hope,       The tenuous hope, the hope that’s half a fear, The lengthy season and the boundless dope,       And the bromidic; “Wait until next year.”       O dread disgrace of trailing in the rear, O Piece of Bunting, flying high and higher       That next October it shall flutter here: This is the end of every fan’s desire.  ENVOY  Ah, Fans, let not the Quarry but the Chase       Be that to which most fondly we aspire! For us not Stake, but Game; not Goal, but Race—       THIS is the end of every fan’s desire.

(On the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama, 1963)



“Mother dear, may I go downtown
Instead of out to play,
And march the streets of Birmingham
In a Freedom March today?” 
“No, baby, no, you may not go,
For the dogs are fierce and wild,
And clubs and hoses, guns and jails
Aren’t good for a little child.” 
“But, mother, I won’t be alone.
Other children will go with me,
And march the streets of Birmingham
To make our country free.” 
“No, baby, no, you may not go,
For I fear those guns will fire.
But you may go to church instead
And sing in the children’s choir.” 
She has combed and brushed her night-dark hair,
And bathed rose petal sweet,
And drawn white gloves on her small brown hands,
And white shoes on her feet. 
The mother smiled to know her child
Was in the sacred place,
But that smile was the last smile
To come upon her face. 
For when she heard the explosion,
Her eyes grew wet and wild.
She raced through the streets of Birmingham
Calling for her child. 
She clawed through bits of glass and brick,
Then lifted out a shoe.
“O, here’s the shoe my baby wore,
But, baby, where are you?”

There’s a black wind howlin’ by Whylah Falls;
There’s a mad rain hammerin’ the flowers;
There’s a shotgunned man moulderin’ in petals;
There’s a killer chucklin’ to himself;
There’s a mother keenin’ her posied son;
There’s a joker amblin’ over his bones.
Go down to the Sixhiboux River, hear it cry,
“Othello Clemence is dead and his murderer’s free!” 
O sang from Whylah Falls and lived by sweat,
Walked that dark road between desire and regret.
He pitched lumber, crushed rock, calloused his hands:
He wasn’t a saint but he was a man.
Scratch Seville shot him and emptied his skull,
Tore a hole in his gut only Death could fill.
Now his martyr-mother witnesses in cries
Over his corpse cankered white by lilies. 
There’s a black wind snakin’ by Whylah Falls;
There’s a river of blood in Jarvis County;
There’s a government that don’t know how to weep;
There’s a mother who can’t get no sleep.
Go down to the Sixhiboux, hear it moan
Like a childless mother far, far, from home,
“There’s a change that’s gonna have to come,
I said, a change that’s gonna have to come.”

The ARGUMENT.  A Vulgar Error having long prevailed among many Persons, who imagine Sally Salisbury the Subject of this Ballad, the Author begs leave to undeceive and assure them it has not the least allusion to her, he being a stranger to her very Name at the time this Song was composed. For as Innocence and Virtue were ever the Boundaries of his Muse, so in this little Poem he had no other view than to set forth the Beauty of a chaste and disinterested Passion, even in the lowest Class of human Life. The real Occasion was this: A Shoemaker’s ’Prentice making Holiday with his Sweet-heart, treated her with a sight of Bedlam, the Puppet-shews, the Flying-chairs, and all the Elegancies of the Moorfields: From whence proceeding to the Farthing Pye-house, he gave her a Collation of Buns, Cheesecakes, Gammon of Bacon, Stuff’d-beef, and Bottled-ale; through all which Scenes the Author dodged them (charm’d with the Simplicity of their Courtship), from whence he drew this little Sketch of Nature; but being then young and obscure, he was very much ridicul’d by some of his Acquaintance for this Performance; which nevertheless made its way into the polite World, and amply recompenced him by the Applause of the divine Addison, who was pleased (more than once) to mention it with Approbation.



Of all the Girls that are so smart
    There’s none like pretty SALLY,She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.There is no Lady in the Land
    Is half so sweet as SALLY,She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.
Her Father he makes Cabbage-nets,
    And through the Streets does cry ’em;Her Mother she sells Laces long,
    To such as please to buy ’em:But sure such Folks could ne’er beget
    So sweet a Girl as SALLY!She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.
When she is by I leave my Work,
    (I love her so sincerely)My Master comes like any Turk,
    And bangs me most severely;But, let him bang his Belly full,
    I’ll bear it all for SALLY;She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.
Of all the Days that’s in the Week,
    I dearly love but one Day,And that’s the Day that comes betwixt
    A Saturday and Monday;For then I’m drest, all in my best,
    To walk abroad with SALLY;She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.
My Master carries me to Church,
    And often am I blamed,Because I leave him in the lurch,
    As soon as Text is named:I leave the Church in Sermon time,
    And slink away to SALLY;She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.
When Christmas comes about again,
    O then I shall have Money;I’ll hoard it up, and Box and all
    I’ll give it to my Honey:And, would it were ten thousand Pounds;
    I’d give it all to SALLY;She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.
My Master and the Neighbours all,
    Make game of me and SALLY;And (but for her) I’d better be
    A Slave and row a Galley:But when my seven long Years are out,
    O then I’ll marry SALLY!O then we’ll wed and then we’ll bed,
    But not in our Alley.

‘’Tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation.’ -Falstaff‘The night cometh, when no man can work.’
What though the beauty I love and serve be cheap,
 Ought you to take me for a beast or fool?All things a man could wish are in her keep;
 For her I turn swashbuckler in love’s school.
 When folk drop in, I take my pot and stoolAnd fall to drinking with no more ado.I fetch them bread, fruit, cheese, and water, too;
 I say all’s right so long as I’m well paid;‘Look in again when your flesh troubles you,
 Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.’
But soon the devil’s among us flesh and fell,
 When penniless to bed comes Madge my whore;I loathe the very sight of her like hell.
 I snatch gown, girdle, surcoat, all she wore,
 And tell her, these shall stand against her score.She grips her hips with both hands, cursing God,Swearing by Jesus’ body, bones, and blood,
 That they shall not. Then I, no whit dismayed,Cross her cracked nose with some stray shiver of wood
 Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.
When all’s made up she drops me a windy word,
 Bloat like a beetle puffed and poisonous:Grins, thumps my pate, and calls me dickey-bird,
 And cuffs me with a fist that’s ponderous.
 We sleep like logs, being drunken both of us;Then when we wake her womb begins to stir;To save her seed she gets me under her
 Wheezing and whining, flat as planks are laid:And thus she spoils me for a whoremonger
 Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.
Blow, hail or freeze, I’ve bread here baked rent free!Whoring’s my trade, and my whore pleases me;
 Bad cat, bad rat; we’re just the same if weighed.We that love filth, filth follows us, you see;Honour flies from us, as from her we flee
 Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.
            I bequeath likewise to fat Madge
             This little song to learn and study;
           By god’s head she’s a sweet fat fadge,
             Devout and soft of flesh and ruddy;
           I love her with my soul and body,
           So doth she me, sweet dainty thing.
             If you fall in with such a lady,
           Read it, and give it her to sing.

Written at Norfolk, in Virginia



“They made her a grave, too cold and dampFor a soul so warm and true;And she’s gone to the Lake of the Dismal Swamp,Where, all night long, by a fire-fly lamp,She paddles her white canoe.
“And her fire-fly lamp I soon shall see,And her paddle I soon shall hear;Long and loving our life shall be,And I’ll hide the maid in a cypress tree,When the footstep of death is near.”
Away to the Dismal Swamp he speeds—His path was rugged and sore,Through tangled juniper, beds of reeds,Through many a fen where the serpent feeds,And man never trod before.
And when on the earth he sunk to sleep,If slumber his eyelids knew,He lay where the deadly vine doth weepIts venomous tear and nightly steepThe flesh with blistering dew!
And near him the she-wolf stirr’d the brake,And the copper-snake breath’d in his ear,Till he starting cried, from his dream awake,“Oh! when shall I see the dusky Lake,And the white canoe of my dear?”
He saw the Lake, and a meteor brightQuick over its surface play’d—“Welcome,” he said, “my dear one’s light!”And the dim shore echoed for many a nightThe name of the death-cold maid.
Till he hollow’d a boat of the birchen bark,Which carried him off from shore;Far, far he follow’d the meteor spark,The wind was high and the clouds were dark,And the boat return’d no more.
But oft, from the Indian hunter’s camp,This lover and maid so trueAre seen at the hour of midnight dampTo cross the Lake by a fire-fly lamp,And paddle their white canoe!

I tell thee, Dick, where I have been,Where I the rarest things have seen;
     Oh, things without compare!Such sights again cannot be foundIn any place on English ground,
     Be it at wake, or fair.
At Charing-Cross, hard by the way,Where we (thou know’st) do sell our hay,
     There is a house with stairs;And there did I see coming downSuch folk as are not in our town,
     Vorty, at least, in pairs.
Amongst the rest, one pest’lent fine(His beard no bigger though than thine)
     Walk’d on before the rest:Our landlord looks like nothing to him:The King (God bless him) ’twould undo him,
     Should he go still so drest.
At Course-a-Park, without all doubt,He should have first been taken out
     By all the maids i’th’ town:Though lusty Roger there had been,Or little George upon the Green,
     Or Vincent of the Crown.
But wot you what? the youth was goingTo make an end of all his wooing;
     The parson for him stay’d:Yet by his leave (for all his haste),He did not so much wish all past
     (Perchance), as did the maid.
The maid (and thereby hangs a tale)For such a maid no Whitsun-ale
     Could ever yet produce:No grape, that’s kindly ripe, could beSo round, so plump, so soft as she,
     Nor half so full of juice.
Her finger was so small, the ringWould not stay on, which they did bring;
     It was too wide a peck:And to say truth (for out it must)It look’d like the great collar (just)
     About our young colt’s neck.
Her feet beneath her petticoat,Like little mice, stole in and out,
     As if they fear’d the light:But oh! she dances such a wayNo sun upon an Easter-day
     Is half so fine a sight.
He would have kissed her once or twice,But she would not, she was nice,
     She would not do’t in sight,And then she looked as who should sayI will do what I list to day;
     And you shall do’t at night.
Her cheeks so rare a white was on,No daisy makes comparison,
     (Who sees them is undone);For streaks of red were mingled there,Such as are on a Catherine pear
     (The side that’s next the sun).
Her lips were red, and one was thin,Compar’d to that was next her chin;
     (Some bee had stung it newly);But (Dick) her eyes so guard her face,I durst no more upon them gaze
     Than on the sun in July.
Her mouth so small, when she does speak,Thou’dst swear her teeth her words did break,
     That they might passage get;But she so handled still the matter,They came as good as ours, or better,
     And are not spent a whit.
If wishing should be any sin,The Parson himself had guilty been;
     (She looked that day so purely,)And did the youth so oft the featAt night, as some did in conceit,
     It would have spoil’d him, surely.
Passion o’ me, how I run on!There’s that that would be thought upon
     (I trow) besides the bride.The business of the kitchen’s great,For it is fit that men should eat;
     Nor was it there denied.
Just in the nick the cook knock’d thrice,And all the waiters in a trice
     His summons did obey:Each serving-man, with dish in hand,March’d boldly up, like our train’d band,
     Presented, and away.
When all the meat was on the table,What man of knife or teeth was able
     To stay to be intreated?And this the very reason was,Before the parson could say grace,
     The company was seated.
Now hats fly off, and youths carouse,Healths first go round, and then the house,
     The bride’s came thick and thick;And when ’twas nam’d another’s health,Perhaps he made it hers by stealth;
     And who could help it, Dick?
O’ th’ sudden up they rise and dance;Then sit again and sigh, and glance;
     Then dance again and kiss:Thus sev’ral ways the time did pass,Whilst ev’ry woman wish’d her place,
     And ev’ry man wish’d his.
By this time all were stol’n asideTo counsel and undress the Bride;
     But that he must not know:But yet ’twas thought he guess’d her mind,And did not mean to stay behind
     Above an hour or so.
When in he came (Dick) there she layLike new-fal’n snow melting away,
     (’Twas time I trow to part)Kisses were now the only stay,Which soon she gave, as who would say,
     Good Boy! with all my heart.
But just as heav’ns would have to cross it,In came the Bridemaids with the Posset:
     The Bridegroom eat in spite;For had he left the Women to’tIt would have cost two hours to do’t,
     Which were too much that night.
At length the candles out and out,All that they had not done, they do’t:
     What that is, who can tell?But I believe it was no moreThen thou and I have done before
     With Bridget, and with Nell.

Fawns in the winter wood
Who feel their horns, and leap,
Swans whom the bleakening mood
Of evening stirs from sleep,
Tall flowers that unfurl
As a moth, driven, flies,
Flowers with the breasts of a girl
And sea-cold eyes.
The bare bright mirrors glow
For their enchanted shapes.
Each is a flame, and so,
Like flame, escapes.

What did he do except lie
under a pear tree, wrapped in
a great cloak, and meditate
on the heavenly bodies? Venerable, the good people of Baltimore
whispered, shocked and more than
a little afraid. After all it was said
he took to strong drink.
Why else would he stay out
under the stars all night
and why hadn’t he married? 
But who would want him! Neither
Ethiopian nor English, neither
lucky nor crazy, a capacious bird
humming as he penned in his mind
another enflamed letter
to President Jefferson—he imagined
the reply, polite and rhetorical.
Those who had been to Philadelphia
reported the statue
of Benjamin Franklin
before the library 
his very size and likeness.
A wife? No, thank you.
At dawn he milked
the cows, then went inside
and put on a pot to stew
while he slept. The clock
he whittled as a boy
still ran. Neighbors
woke him up
with warm bread and quilts.
At nightfall he took out 
his rifle—a white-maned
figure stalking the darkened
breast of the Union—and
shot at the stars, and by chance
one went out. Had he killed? I assure thee, my dear Sir! 
Lowering his eyes to fields
sweet with the rot of spring, he could see
a government’s domed city
rising from the morass and spreading
in a spiral of lights....

Things happen when you drink too much mescal.
One night, with not enough food in my belly,
he kept on buying.   I’m a girl who’ll fall
damn near in love with gratitude and, well, he
was hot and generous and so the least
that I could do was let him kiss me, hard
and soft and any way you want it, beast
and beauty, lime and salt—sweet Bacchus’ pards—
and when his friend showed up I felt so warm
and generous I let him kiss me too.
His buddy asked me if it was the worm
inside that makes me do the things I do.
I wasn’t sure which worm he meant, the one
I ate?   The one that eats at me alone?

In Scarlet town, where I was born,    There was a fair maid dwellin’, Made every youth cry Well-a-way!    Her name was Barbara Allen.  All in the merry month of May,    When green buds they were swellin’, Young Jemmy Grove on his death-bed lay,    For love of Barbara Allen.  He sent his man in to her then,    To the town where she was dwellin’; “O haste and come to my master dear,    If your name be Barbara Allen.”  So slowly, slowly rase she up,    And slowly she came nigh him, And when she drew the curtain by—    “Young man, I think you’re dyin’.”  “O it’s I am sick and very very sick,    And it’s all for Barbara Allen.”— O the better for me ye’se never be,    Tho’ your heart’s blood were a-spillin’!  “O dinna ye mind, young man,” says she,    “When the red wine ye were fillin’, That ye made the healths go round and round,    And slighted Barbara Allen?”  He turned his face unto the wall,    And death was with him dealin’: “Adieu, adieu, my dear friends all,    And be kind to Barbara Allen!”  As she was walking o’er the fields,    She heard the dead-bell knellin’; And every jow the dead-bell gave    Cried “Woe to Barbara Allen.”  “O mother, mother, make my bed,    O make it saft and narrow: My love has died for me today,    I’ll die for him tomorrow.”  “Farewell,” she said, “ye virgins all,    And shun the fault I fell in: Henceforth take warning by the fall    Of cruel Barbara Allen.”

Up from the meadows rich with corn,
Clear in the cool September morn, 
The clustered spires of Frederick stand
Green-walled by the hills of Maryland. 
Round about them orchards sweep,
Apple- and peach-tree fruited deep, 
Fair as a garden of the Lord
To the eyes of the famished rebel horde, 
On that pleasant morn of the early fall
When Lee marched over the mountain wall,— 
Over the mountains winding down,
Horse and foot, into Frederick town. 
Forty flags with their silver stars,
Forty flags with their crimson bars, 
Flapped in the morning wind: the sun
Of noon looked down, and saw not one. 
Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
Bowed with her fourscore years and ten; 
Bravest of all in Frederick town,
She took up the flag the men hauled down; 
In her attic window the staff she set,
To show that one heart was loyal yet. 
Up the street came the rebel tread,
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead. 
Under his slouched hat left and right
He glanced: the old flag met his sight. 
“Halt!”— the dust-brown ranks stood fast.
“Fire!”— out blazed the rifle-blast. 
It shivered the window, pane and sash;
It rent the banner with seam and gash. 
Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf; 
She leaned far out on the window-sill,
And shook it forth with a royal will. 
“Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,
But spare your country’s flag,” she said. 
A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,
Over the face of the leader came; 
The nobler nature within him stirred
To life at that woman’s deed and word: 
“Who touches a hair of yon gray head
Dies like a dog! March on!” he said. 
All day long through Frederick street
Sounded the tread of marching feet: 
All day long that free flag tost
Over the heads of the rebel host. 
Ever its torn folds rose and fell
On the loyal winds that loved it well; 
And through the hill-gaps sunset light
Shone over it with a warm good-night. 
Barbara Frietchie’s work is o’er,
And the Rebel rides on his raids no more. 
Honor to her! and let a tear
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall’s bier. 
Over Barbara Frietchie’s grave
Flag of Freedom and Union, wave! 
Peace and order and beauty draw
Round thy symbol of light and law; 
And ever the stars above look down
On thy stars below in Frederick town!

Blessings on thee, little man, Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan! With thy turned-up pantaloons, And thy merry whistled tunes; With thy red lip, redder still Kissed by strawberries on the hill; With the sunshine on thy face, Through thy torn brim’s jaunty grace; From my heart I give thee joy,— I was once a barefoot boy! Prince thou art,—the grown-up man Only is republican. Let the million-dollared ride! Barefoot, trudging at his side, Thou hast more than he can buy In the reach of ear and eye,— Outward sunshine, inward joy: Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!  Oh for boyhood’s painless play, Sleep that wakes in laughing day, Health that mocks the doctor’s rules, Knowledge never learned of schools, Of the wild bee’s morning chase, Of the wild-flower’s time and place, Flight of fowl and habitude Of the tenants of the wood; How the tortoise bears his shell, How the woodchuck digs his cell, And the ground-mole sinks his well; How the robin feeds her young, How the oriole’s nest is hung; Where the whitest lilies blow, Where the freshest berries grow, Where the ground-nut trails its vine, Where the wood-grape’s clusters shine; Of the black wasp’s cunning way, Mason of his walls of clay, And the architectural plans Of gray hornet artisans! For, eschewing books and tasks, Nature answers all he asks; Hand in hand with her he walks, Face to face with her he talks, Part and parcel of her joy,— Blessings on the barefoot boy!  Oh for boyhood’s time of June, Crowding years in one brief moon, When all things I heard or saw, Me, their master, waited for. I was rich in flowers and trees, Humming-birds and honey-bees; For my sport the squirrel played, Plied the snouted mole his spade; For my taste the blackberry cone Purpled over hedge and stone; Laughed the brook for my delight Through the day and through the night, Whispering at the garden wall, Talked with me from fall to fall; Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond, Mine the walnut slopes beyond, Mine, on bending orchard trees, Apples of Hesperides! Still as my horizon grew, Larger grew my riches too; All the world I saw or knew Seemed a complex Chinese toy, Fashioned for a barefoot boy!  Oh for festal dainties spread, Like my bowl of milk and bread; Pewter spoon and bowl of wood, On the door-stone, gray and rude! O’er me, like a regal tent, Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent, Purple-curtained, fringed with gold, Looped in many a wind-swung fold; While for music came the play Of the pied frogs’ orchestra; And, to light the noisy choir, Lit the fly his lamp of fire. I was monarch: pomp and joy Waited on the barefoot boy!  Cheerily, then, my little man, Live and laugh, as boyhood can! Though the flinty slopes be hard, Stubble-speared the new-mown sward, Every morn shall lead thee through Fresh baptisms of the dew; Every evening from thy feet Shall the cool wind kiss the heat: All too soon these feet must hide In the prison cells of pride, Lose the freedom of the sod, Like a colt’s for work be shod, Made to tread the mills of toil, Up and down in ceaseless moil: Happy if their track be found Never on forbidden ground; Happy if they sink not in Quick and treacherous sands of sin. Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy, Ere it passes, barefoot boy!

for Dore and Adja



Under the bronze crown
Too big for the head of the stone cherub whose feet   
      A serpent has begun to eat,
Sweet water brims a cockle and braids down 
            Past spattered mosses, breaks
On the tipped edge of a second shell, and fills   
      The massive third below. It spills
In threads then from the scalloped rim, and makes 
            A scrim or summery tent
For a faun-ménage and their familiar goose.   
      Happy in all that ragged, loose
Collapse of water, its effortless descent 
            And flatteries of spray,
The stocky god upholds the shell with ease,
      Watching, about his shaggy knees,
The goatish innocence of his babes at play; 
            His fauness all the while
Leans forward, slightly, into a clambering mesh   
      Of water-lights, her sparkling flesh
In a saecular ecstasy, her blinded smile 
            Bent on the sand floor
Of the trefoil pool, where ripple-shadows come
      And go in swift reticulum,
More addling to the eye than wine, and more 
            Interminable to thought
Than pleasure’s calculus. Yet since this all   
      Is pleasure, flash, and waterfall,   
Must it not be too simple? Are we not 
            More intricately expressed
In the plain fountains that Maderna set
      Before St. Peter’s—the main jet   
Struggling aloft until it seems at rest 
            In the act of rising, until   
The very wish of water is reversed,
      That heaviness borne up to burst   
In a clear, high, cavorting head, to fill 
            With blaze, and then in gauze   
Delays, in a gnatlike shimmering, in a fine
      Illumined version of itself, decline,
And patter on the stones its own applause? 
            If that is what men are
Or should be, if those water-saints display   
      The pattern of our areté,
What of these showered fauns in their bizarre, 
            Spangled, and plunging house?
They are at rest in fulness of desire
      For what is given, they do not tire
Of the smart of the sun, the pleasant water-douse 
            And riddled pool below,
Reproving our disgust and our ennui   
      With humble insatiety.
Francis, perhaps, who lay in sister snow 
            Before the wealthy gate
Freezing and praising, might have seen in this   
      No trifle, but a shade of bliss—
That land of tolerable flowers, that state 
            As near and far as grass
Where eyes become the sunlight, and the hand   
      Is worthy of water: the dreamt land
Toward which all hungers leap, all pleasures pass.

Reading in bed, full of sentiment
for the mild evening and the children
asleep in adjacent rooms, hearing them
cry out now and then the brief reports
of sufficient imagination, and listening
at the same time compassionately
to the scrabble of claws, the fast treble
in the chimney—
                      then it was out,
not a trapped bird
beating at the seams of the ceiling,
but a bat lifting toward us, falling away.  Dominion over every living thing,
large brain, a choice of weapons—

                    The day is fresh-washed and fair, and there is a smell of tulips and narcissus in the air.
       The sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes of greenish-white. It cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel, and cracks it to bright light.
       Little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance, dance, and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling; a stir of my finger sets them whirring, reeling. I move a foot and the planes of light in the water jar. I lie back and laugh, and let the green-white water, the sun-flawed beryl water, flow over me. The day is almost too bright to bear, the green water covers me from the too bright day. I will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots. The sky is blue and high. A crow flaps by the window, and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air.

Ye Sons of Great Britain! come join with meAnd sing in praise of the gallant British Armie,That behaved right manfully in the Soudan,At the great battle of Omdurman.
’Twas in the year of 1898, and on the 2nd of September,Which the Khalifa and his surviving followers will long remember,Because Sir Herbert Kitchener has annihilated them outright,By the British troops and Soudanese in the Omdurman fight.
The Sirdar and his Army left the camp in grand array,And marched on to Omdurman without delay,Just as the brigades had reached the crest adjoining the Nile,And became engaged with the enemy in military style.
The Dervishes had re-formed under cover of a rocky eminence,Which to them, no doubt, was a strong defence,And they were massed together in battle arrayAround the black standard of the Khalifa, which made a grand display.
But General Maxwell’s Soudanese brigade seized the eminence in a short time,And General Macdonald’s brigade then joined the firing line;And in ten minutes, long before the attack could be driven home,The flower of the Khalifa’s army was almost overthrown.
Still manfully the dusky warriors strove to make headway,But the Soudanese troops and British swept them back without dismay,And their main body were mown down by their deadly fire—But still the heroic Dervishes refused to retire.
And defiantly they planted their standards and died by them,To their honour be it said, just like brave men;But at last they retired, with their hearts full of woe,Leaving the field white with corpses, like a meadow dotted with snow.
The chief heroes in the fight were the 21st Lancers;They made a brilliant charge on the enemy with ringing cheers,And through the dusky warriors bodies their lances they did thrust,Whereby many of them were made to lick the dust.
Then at a quarter past eleven the Sirdar sounded the advance,And the remnant of the Dervishes fled, which was their only chance,While the cavalry cut off their retreat while they ran;Then the Sirdar, with the black standard of the Khalifa, headed for Omdurman.
And when the Khalifa saw his noble army cut down,With rage and grief he did fret and frown;Then he spurred his noble steed, and swiftly it ran,While inwardly to himself he cried, “Catch me if you can!”
And Mahdism now has received a crushing blow,For the Khalifa and his followers have met with a complete overthrow;And General Gordon has been avenged, the good Christian,By the defeat of the Khalifa at the battle of Omdurman.
Now since the Khalifa has been defeated and his rule at an end,Let us thank God that fortunately did sendThe brave Sir Herbert Kitchener to conquer that bad man,The inhuman Khalifa, and his followers at the battle of Omdurman.
Success to Sir Herbert Kitchener! he is a great commander,And as skilful in military tactics as the great Alexander,Because he devised a very wise plan,And by it has captured the town of Omdurman.
I wish success to the British and Soudanese Army,May God protect them by land and by sea,May he enable them always to conquer the foe,And to establish what’s right wherever they go.

Ye sons of Great Britain, come join with me,And sing in praise of Sir Garnet Wolseley;Sound drums and trumpets cheerfully,For he has acted most heroically.
Therefore loudly his praises singUntil the hills their echoes back doth ring;For he is a noble hero bold,And an honour to his Queen and country, be it told.
He has gained for himself fame and renown,Which to posterity will be handed down;Because he has defeated Arabi by land and by sea,And from the battle of Tel-el-Kebir he made him to flee.
With an army about fourteen thousand strong,Through Egypt he did fearlessly march along,With the gallant and brave Highland brigade,To whom honour is due, be it said.
Arabi’s army was about seventy thousand in all,And, virtually speaking, it wasn’t very small;But if they had been as numerous again,The Irish and Highland brigades would have beaten them, it is plain.
’Twas on the 13th day of September, in the year of 1882,Which Arabi and his rebel horde long will rue;Because Sir Garnet Wolseley and his brave little bandFought and conquered them on Kebir land.
He marched upon the enemy with his gallant bandO’er the wild and lonely desert sand,And attacked them before daylight,And in twenty minutes he put them to flight.
The first shock of the attack was borne by the Second Brigade,Who behaved most manfully, it is said,Under the command of brave General Grahame,And have gained a lasting honour to their name.
But Major Hart and the 18th Royal Irish, conjoint,Carried the trenches at the bayonet point;Then the Marines chased them about four miles away,At the charge of the bayonet, without dismay!
General Sir Archibald Alison led on the Highland Brigade,Who never were the least afraid.And such has been the case in this Egyptian war,For at the charge of the bayonet they ran from them afar!
With their bagpipes playing, and one ringing cheer,And the 42nd soon did the trenches clear;Then hand to hand they did engage,And fought like tigers in a cage.
Oh! it must have been a glorious sightTo see Sir Garnet Wolseley in the thickest of the fight!In the midst of shot and shell, and the cannon’s roar,Whilst the dead and the dying lay weltering in their gore.
Then the Egyptians were forced to yield,And the British were left masters of the field;Then Arabi he did fret and frownTo see his army thus cut down.
Then Arabi the rebel took to flight,And spurred his Arab steed with all his might:With his heart full of despair and woe,And never halted till he reached Cairo.
Now since the Egyptian war is at an end,Let us thank God! Who did sendSir Garnet Wolseley to crush and killArabi and his rebel army at Kebir hill.

Back when I used to be Indian
I am standing outside the
pool hall with my sister.
She strawberry blonde. Stale sweat
and beer through the
open door. A warrior leans on his stick,
fingers blue with chalk.
Another bends to shoot.
His braids brush the green
felt, swinging to the beat
of the jukebox. We move away.
Hank Williams falls again

I look back.
A wind off the distant hills lifts my shirt,

Be still. The Hanging Gardens were a dreamThat over Persian roses flew to kissThe curlèd lashes of Semiramis.Troy never was, nor green Skamander stream.Provence and Troubadour are merest liesThe glorious hair of Venice was a beamMade within Titian’s eye. The sunsets seem,The world is very old and nothing is.Be still. Thou foolish thing, thou canst not wake,Nor thy tears wedge thy soldered lids apart,But patter in the darkness of thy heart.Thy brain is plagued. Thou art a frighted owlBlind with the light of life thou ’ldst not forsake,And Error loves and nourishes thy soul.

   Lies desert in thy brain.
When first my father settled here,
   ’Twas then the frontier line:The panther’s scream, filled night with fear
   And bears preyed on the swine.
But woe for Bruin’s short lived fun,
   When rose the squealing cry;Now man and horse, with dog and gun,
   For vengeance, at him fly.
A sound of danger strikes his ear;
   He gives the breeze a snuff;Away he bounds, with little fear,
   And seeks the tangled rough.
On press his foes, and reach the ground,
   Where’s left his half munched meal;The dogs, in circles, scent around,
   And find his fresh made trail.
With instant cry, away they dash,
   And men as fast pursue;O’er logs they leap, through water splash,
   And shout the brisk halloo.
Now to elude the eager pack,
   Bear shuns the open ground;Through matted vines, he shapes his track
   And runs it, round and round.
The tall fleet cur, with deep-mouthed voice,
   Now speeds him, as the wind;While half-grown pup, and short-legged fice,
   Are yelping far behind.
And fresh recruits are dropping in
   To join the merry corps:With yelp and yell,—a mingled din—
   The woods are in a roar.
And round, and round the chace now goes,
   The world’s alive with fun;Nick Carter’s horse, his rider throws,
   And more, Hill drops his gun.
Now sorely pressed, bear glances back,
   And lolls his tired tongue;When as, to force him from his track,
   An ambush on him sprung.
Across the glade he sweeps for flight,
   And fully is in view.The dogs, new-fired, by the sight,
   Their cry, and speed, renew.
The foremost ones, now reach his rear,
   He turns, they dash away;And circling now, the wrathful bear,
   They have him full at bay.
At top of speed, the horse-men come,
   All screaming in a row,“Whoop! Take him Tiger. Seize him Drum.”
   Bang,—bang—the rifles go.
And furious now, the dogs he tears,
   And crushes in his ire,Wheels right and left, and upward rears,
   With eyes of burning fire.
But leaden death is at his heart,
   Vain all the strength he plies.And, spouting blood from every part,
   He reels, and sinks, and dies.
And now a dinsome clamor rose,
   ’Bout who should have his skin;Who first draws blood, each hunter knows,
   This prize must always win.
But who did this, and how to trace
   What’s true from what’s a lie,Like lawyers, in a murder case
   They stoutly argufy.
Aforesaid fice, of blustering mood,
   Behind, and quite forgot,Just now emerging from the wood,
   Arrives upon the spot.
With grinning teeth, and up-turned hair—
   Brim full of spunk and wrath,He growls, and seizes on dead bear,
   And shakes for life and death.
And swells as if his skin would tear,
   And growls and shakes again;And swears, as plain as dog can swear,
   That he has won the skin.
Conceited whelp! we laugh at thee—
   Nor mind, that now a fewOf pompous, two-legged dogs there be,
   Conceited quite as you.

Tonight the bear
comes to the orchard and, balancing
on her hind legs, dances under the apple trees,
hanging onto their boughs,
dragging their branches down to earth.
Look again. It is not the bear
but some afterimage of her
like the car I once saw in the driveway
after the last guest had gone.
Snow pulls the apple boughs to the ground.
Whatever moves in the orchard—
heavy, lumbering—is clear as wind. 
The bear is long gone.
Drunk on apples,
she banged over the trash cans that fall night,
then skidded downstream. By now
she must be logged in for the winter.
Unless she is choosy.
I imagine her as very choosy,
sniffing at the huge logs, pawing them, trying
each one on for size,
but always coming out again. 
Until tonight.
Tonight sap freezes under her skin.
Her breath leaves white apples in the air.
As she walks she dozes,
listening to the sound of axes chopping wood.
Somewhere she can never catch up to
trees are falling. Chips pile up like snow
When she does find it finally,
the log draws her in as easily as a forest,
and for a while she continues to see,
just ahead of her, the moon
trapped like a salmon in the ice.

By the time I recalled that it is also
terrifying, we had gone too far into
the charmed woods to return. It was then 
the beautiful animal appeared in our path:
ribs jutting, moon-fed eyes moving
from me to you and back. If we show 
none of the fear, it may tire of waiting
for the triggering flight, it may ask only
to lie between us and sleep, fur warm 
on our skin, breath sweet on our necks
as it dreams of slaughter, as we dream
alternately of feeding and taming it 
and of being the first to run. The woods
close tight around us, lying nested here
like spoons in a drawer of knives, to see 
who wakes first, and from which dream.

Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me, Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee; Sounds of the rude world heard in the day, Lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd a way!  Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song, List while I woo thee with soft melody; Gone are the cares of life's busy throng,— Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me! Beautiful dreamer awake unto me!  Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelie; Over the streamlet vapors are borne, Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.  Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart, E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea; Then will all clouds of sorrow depart,— Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me! Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

Corinna, pride of Drury-Lane For whom no shepherd sighs in vain; Never did Covent Garden boast So bright a battered, strolling toast; No drunken rake to pick her up, No cellar where on tick to sup; Returning at the midnight hour; Four stories climbing to her bow’r; Then, seated on a three-legged chair, Takes off her artificial hair: Now, picking out a crystal eye, She wipes it clean, and lays it by. Her eye-brows from a mouse’s hide, Stuck on with art on either side, Pulls off with care, and first displays ’em, Then in a play-book smoothly lays ’em. Now dexterously her plumpers draws, That serve to fill her hollow jaws. Untwists a wire; and from her gums A set of teeth completely comes. Pulls out the rags contrived to prop Her flabby dugs and down they drop. Proceeding on, the lovely goddess Unlaces next her steel-ribbed bodice; Which by the operator’s skill, Press down the lumps, the hollows fill, Up goes her hand, and off she slips The bolsters that supply her hips. With gentlest touch, she next explores Her shankers, issues, running sores, Effects of many a sad disaster; And then to each applies a plaister. But must, before she goes to bed, Rub off the dawbs of white and red; And smooth the furrows in her front With greasy paper stuck upon’t. She takes a bolus ere she sleeps; And then between two blankets creeps. With pains of love tormented lies; Or if she chance to close her eyes, Of Bridewell and the Compter dreams, And feels the lash, and faintly screams; Or, by a faithless bully drawn, At some hedge-tavern lies in pawn; Or to Jamaica seems transported, Alone, and by no planter courted; Or, near Fleet-Ditch’s oozy brinks, Surrounded with a hundred stinks, Belated, seems on watch to lie, And snap some cully passing by; Or, struck with fear, her fancy runs On watchmen, constables and duns, From whom she meets with frequent rubs; But, never from religious clubs; Whose favor she is sure to find, Because she pays ’em all in kind.          Corinna wakes. A dreadful sight! Behold the ruins of the night! A wicked rat her plaster stole, Half eat, and dragged it to his hole. The crystal eye, alas, was missed; And puss had on her plumpers pissed. A pigeon picked her issue-peas; And Shock her tresses filled with fleas.          The nymph, tho’ in this mangled plight, Must ev’ry morn her limbs unite. But how shall I describe her arts To recollect the scattered parts? Or shew the anguish, toil, and pain, Of gath’ring up herself again? The bashful muse will never bear In such a scene to interfere. Corinna in the morning dizened, Who sees, will spew; who smells, be poison’d.

Often, in the Repose of Evening her soul took a lightness from
                  the mountains across, although the day was harsh and
                  tomorrow foreign. 
But, when it darkened well and out came the priest’s hand over
                  the little garden of the dead, She 
Alone, Standing, with the few domestics of the night—the blowing
                  rosemary and the murmur of smoke from the kilns—
                  at sea’s entry, wakeful 
Otherly beauty! 
Only the waves’ words half-guessed or in a rustle, and others
                  resembling the dead’s that startle in the cypress, strange
                  zodiacs that lit up her magnetic moon-turned head.
                  And one 
Unbelievable cleanliness allowed, to great depth in her, the real
                  landscape to be seen, 
Where, near the river, the dark ones fought against the Angel,
                  exactly showing how she’s born, Beauty 
Or what we otherwise call tear. 
And long as her thinking lasted, you could feel it overflow the
                  glowing sight bitterly in the eyes and the huge, like an
                  ancient prostitute’s, cheekbones 
Stretched to the extreme points of the Large Dog and of the Virgin. 
“Far from the pestilential city I dreamed of her deserted place
                  where a tear may have no meaning and the only light be
                  from the flame that ravishes all that for me exists. 
“Shoulder-to-shoulder under what will be, sworn to extreme silence
                  and the co-ruling of the stars, 
“As if I didn’t know yet, the illiterate, that there exactly, in extreme
                  silence are the most repellent thuds 
“And that, since it became unbearable inside a man’s chest, solitude
                  dispersed and seeded stars!”

Morning glories, pale as a mist drying,
fade from the heat of the day, but already
hunchback bees in pirate pants and with peg-leg
hooks have found and are boarding them. 
This could do for the sack of the imaginary
fleet. The raiders loot the galleons even as they
one by one vanish and leave still real
only what has been snatched out of the spell. 
I’ve never seen bees more purposeful except
when the hive is threatened. They know
the good of it must be grabbed and hauled
before the whole feast wisps off. 
They swarm in light and, fast, dive in,
then drone out, slow, their pantaloons heavy
with gold and sunlight. The line of them,
like thin smoke, wafts over the hedge. 
And back again to find the fleet gone.
Well, they got this day’s good of it. Off
they cruise to what stays open longer.
Nothing green gives honey. And by now 
you’d have to look twice to see more than green
where all those white sails trembled
when the world was misty and open
and the prize was there to be taken.

Almost
the first reindeer
shipped North by boxcar from Lapland   
but a toy model
got there first. 
A dwarf invented reindeer on his own.   
He was Santa’s favorite. He
hadn't known
they already existed. 
This discouraged dwarf
was close to taking his life but
Santa showed up
encircled by snow.
He said, “I will use the real reindeer for my sled 
always in yoke
to your original invention.”
That night the gears that turned the Pole   
stopped
and began to turn the other way,   
so it be so. 
My love is a toy model waiting
for a reindeer to carry me.

1    I gaze through a telescope at the Orion Nebula,
      a blue vapor with a cluster of white stars,
      gaze at the globular cluster in Hercules,
      needle and pinpoint lights stream into my eyes.
      A woman puts a baby in a plastic bag
      and places it in a dumpster; someone
      parking a car hears it cry and rescues it.
      Is this the little o, the earth?
      Deer at dusk are munching apple blossoms;
      a green snake glides down flowing acequia water.
      The night is rich with floating pollen;
      in the morning, we break up the soil
      to prepare for corn. Fossilized cotton pollen
      has been discovered at a site above six thousand feet.
      As the character yi, change, is derived
      from the skin of a chameleon, we are
      living the briefest hues on the skin
      of the world. I gaze at the Sombrero Galaxy
      between Corvus and Spica: on a night with no moon,
      I notice my shadow by starlight.  
2    Where does matter end and space begin?
      
      blue jays eating suet; 
      juggling three crumbled newspaper balls
      wrapped with duct tape; 
      tasseling corn; 
      the gravitational bending of light; 
      “We're dying”; 
      stringing a coral necklace; 
      he drew his equations on butcher paper; 
      vanishing in sunlight;

      red persimmons; 
      what is it like to catch up to light? 
      he threw Before Completion:
      six in the third place, nine in the sixth.  
3    A wavering line of white-faced ibises,

      A psychic says, “Search a pawnshop 
      for the missing ring.” Loss, a black hole.
      You do not intend to commit a series of
      blunders, but to discover in one error 
      an empty cocoon. A weaver dumps

      You recollect watching a yellow-

      form a chrysalis: in days the chrysalis
      lightened and became transparent:
      a monarch emerged and flexed its wings. 
      You are startled to retrieve what you forgot:
      it has the crunching sound of river
      breakup when air is calm and very clear.     
4    Beijing, 1985: a poet describes herding pigs
      beside a girl with a glass eye and affirms
      the power to dream and transform. Later,
      in exile, he axes his wife and hangs himself.
      Do the transformations of memory
      become the changing lines of divination?
      Is the continuum of a moment a red
      poppy blooming by a fence, or is it
      a woman undergoing radiation treatment
      who stretches out on a bed to rest
      and senses she is stretching out to die?
      At night I listen to your breathing,
      guess at the freckles on your arms,
      smell your hair at the back of your neck.
      Tiger lilies are budding in pots in the patio;
      daikon is growing deep in the garden.
      I see a bewildered man ask for direction,

      receiving a fax; 
      buffeted on a floatplane between islands; 
      a peregrine falcon making a slow circle with outstretched
          wings; 
      he crumpled papers, threw them on the floor,
      called it City of Bums; 
      polar aligning; 
      inhaling the smell of her hair; 
      a red handprint on a sandstone wall; 
      digging up ginseng; 
      carding wool; 
      where does matter end and space begin?  
6    Mushroom hunting at the ski basin, I spot
      a blood-red amanita pushing up under fir,
      find a white-gilled Man On Horseback,
      notice dirt breaking and carefully unearth
      a cluster of gold chanterelles. I stop
      and gaze at yellow light in a clearing.
      As grief dissolves and the mind begins to clear,
      an s twist begins to loosen the z twisted fiber.
      A spider asleep under a geranium leaf
      may rest a leg on the radial string of a web,
      but cool nights are pushing nasturtiums to bloom.
      An eggplant deepens in hue and drops to the ground.
      Yellow specks of dust float in the clearing;
      in memory, a series of synchronous spaces.
      As a cotton fiber burns in an s twist
      and unravels the z twist of its existence,
      the mind unravels and ravels a wave of light,
      persimmons ripening on leafless trees.

A month or twain to live on honeycomb    Is pleasant; but one tires of scented time,    Cold sweet recurrence of accepted rhyme, And that strong purple under juice and foam Where the wine’s heart has burst; Nor feel the latter kisses like the first.  Once yet, this poor one time; I will not pray    Even to change the bitterness of it,     The bitter taste ensuing on the sweet, To make your tears fall where your soft hair lay All blurred and heavy in some perfumed wise Over my face and eyes.  And yet who knows what end the scythèd wheat    Makes of its foolish poppies’ mouths of red?    These were not sown, these are not harvested, They grow a month and are cast under feet  And none has care thereof, As none has care of divided love.  I know each shadow of your lips by rote,    Each change of love in eyelids and eyebrows;    The fashion of fair temples tremulous With tender blood, and colour of your throat; I know not how love is gone out of this, Seeing that all was his.  Love’s likeness there endures upon all these:    But out of these one shall not gather love.    Day hath not strength nor the night shade enough To make love whole and fill his lips with ease, As some bee-builded cell Feels at filled lips the heavy honey swell.  I know not how this last month leaves your hair    Less full of purple colour and hid spice,    And that luxurious trouble of closed eyes Is mixed with meaner shadows and waste care; And love, kissed out by pleasure, seems not yet Worth patience to regret.

Use a new conductor every time-out
you have sextet—before foreshore,
before pen name gets anywhere
near any bogey opera glass
(to avoid expulsion to any bogey
flunkey that can carry infidel)
Handle conductor gently 
Put conductor on as soon as
pen name is hard
be sure rolled-up ringworm is on
the outspokenness. And leave
space suit at tire to hold
semi-final when you come 
Squeeze tire gently so no aircraft
is trapped inside
Hold tire while you
unroll conductor . . . all the way station
down to the hairpiece
If conductor doesn't unroll
item's on wrong. Throw item away
Start over with a new onion

Here’s a seed. Food
for a week. Cow skull
in the pasture; back room
where the brain was:
spacious hut for me. 
Small then, and smaller.
My desire’s to stay alive
and be no larger

lodged in my own heart. 
And if the heart’s a rock
I’ll whack it with this tin
cup and eat the sparks,
always screaming, always
screaming for more.

Behold, the grave of a wicked man,And near it, a stern spirit.There came a drooping maid with violets, But the spirit grasped her arm.“No flowers for him,” he said.The maid wept: “Ah, I loved him.”But the spirit, grim and frowning: “No flowers for him.” 
Now, this is it —If the spirit was just,Why did the maid weep?

1896



They christened my brother of old—
   And a saintly name he bears—
They gave him his place to hold
   At the head of the belfry-stairs,
   Where the minster-towers stand
And the breeding kestrels cry.
   Would I change with my brother a league inland? (Shoal! ’Ware shoal!) Not I ! 
In the flush of the hot June prime,
   O’er sleek flood-tides afire,
I hear him hurry the chime
   To the bidding of checked Desire;
   Till the sweated ringers tire
And the wild bob-majors die.
   Could I wait for my turn in the godly choir? (Shoal! ’Ware shoal!) Not I! 
When the smoking scud is blown—
   When the greasy wind-rack lowers—
Apart and at peace and alone,
   He counts the changeless hours.
   He wars with darkling Powers
(I war with, a darkling sea);
   Would he stoop to my work in the gusty mirk? (Shoal! ’Ware shoal!) Not he! 
There was never a priest to pray,
   There was never a hand to toll,
When they made me guard of the bay,
   And moored me over the shoal.
   I rock, I reel, and I roll—
My four great hammers ply—
   Could I speak or be still at the Church’s will? (Shoal! ’Ware shoal!) Not I! 
The landward marks have failed,
   The fog-bank glides unguessed,
The seaward lights are veiled,
   The spent deep feigns her rest:
   But my ear is laid to her breast,
I lift to the swell—I cry!
   Could I wait in sloth on the Church’s oath? (Shoal! ’Ware shoal!) Not I! 
At the careless end of night
   I thrill to the nearing screw;
I turn in the clearing light
   And I call to the drowsy crew;
   And the mud boils foul and blue
As the blind bow backs away.
   Will they give me their thanks if they clear the banks? (Shoal! ’Ware shoal!) Not they! 
The beach-pools cake and skim,
   The bursting spray-heads freeze,
I gather on crown and rim
   The grey, grained ice of the seas,
   Where, sheathed from bitt to trees,
The plunging colliers lie.
   Would I barter my place for the Church’s grace? (Shoal! ’Ware shoal!) Not I! 
Through the blur of the whirling snow,
   Or the black of the inky sleet,
The lanterns gather and grow,
   And I look for the homeward fleet.
   Rattle of block and sheet—
‘Ready about—stand by!’
   Shall I ask them a fee ere they fetch the quay? (Shoal! ’Ware shoal!) Not I! 
I dip and I surge and I swing
   In the rip of the racing tide,
By the gates of doom I sing,
   On the horns of death I ride.
   A ship-length overside,
Between the course and the sand,
   Fretted and bound I bide
             Peril whereof I cry.
Would I change with my brother a league inland? (Shoal! ’Ware shoal!) Not I!

We stripped in the first warm spring night
and ran down into the Detroit River
to baptize ourselves in the brine
of car parts, dead fish, stolen bicycles,
melted snow. I remember going under
hand in hand with a Polish highschool girl
I'd never seen before, and the cries
our breath made caught at the same time
on the cold, and rising through the layers
of darkness into the final moonless atmosphere
that was this world, the girl breaking
the surface after me and swimming out
on the starless waters towards the lights
of Jefferson Ave. and the stacks
of the old stove factory unwinking.
Turning at last to see no island at all
but a perfect calm dark as far
as there was sight, and then a light
and another riding low out ahead
to bring us home, ore boats maybe, or smokers
walking alone. Back panting
to the gray coarse beach we didn't dare
fall on, the damp piles of clothes,
and dressing side by side in silence
to go back where we came from.

There was such speed in her little body,   
And such lightness in her footfall,   
It is no wonder her brown study
Astonishes us all. 
Her wars were bruited in our high window.   
We looked among orchard trees and beyond   
Where she took arms against her shadow,   
Or harried unto the pond 
The lazy geese, like a snow cloud
Dripping their snow on the green grass,   
Tricking and stopping, sleepy and proud,   
Who cried in goose, Alas, 
For the tireless heart within the little   
Lady with rod that made them rise
From their noon apple-dreams and scuttle   
Goose-fashion under the skies! 
But now go the bells, and we are ready,   
In one house we are sternly stopped
To say we are vexed at her brown study,   
Lying so primly propped.

What say the Bells of San Blas To the ships that southward pass        From the harbor of Mazatlan? To them it is nothing more Than the sound of surf on the shore,—        Nothing more to master or man.  But to me, a dreamer of dreams, To whom what is and what seems        Are often one and the same,— The Bells of San Blas to me Have a strange, wild melody,        And are something more than a name.  For bells are the voice of the church; They have tones that touch and search        The hearts of young and old; One sound to all, yet each Lends a meaning to their speech,        And the meaning is manifold.  They are a voice of the Past, Of an age that is fading fast,        Of a power austere and grand; When the flag of Spain unfurled Its folds o'er this western world,        And the Priest was lord of the land.  The chapel that once looked down On the little seaport town        Has crumbled into the dust; And on oaken beams below The bells swing to and fro,        And are green with mould and rust.  "Is, then, the old faith dead," They say, "and in its stead        Is some new faith proclaimed, That we are forced to remain Naked to sun and rain,        Unsheltered and ashamed?  "Once in our tower aloof We rang over wall and roof        Our warnings and our complaints; And round about us there The white doves filled the air,        Like the white souls of the saints.  "The saints! Ah, have they grown Forgetful of their own?        Are they asleep, or dead, That open to the sky Their ruined Missions lie,        No longer tenanted?  "Oh, bring us back once more The vanished days of yore,        When the world with faith was filled; Bring back the fervid zeal, The hearts of fire and steel,        The hands that believe and build.  "Then from our tower again We will send over land and main        Our voices of command, Like exiled kings who return To their thrones, and the people learn        That the Priest is lord of the land!"  O Bells of San Blas, in vain Ye call back the Past again!        The Past is deaf to your prayer; Out of the shadows of night The world rolls into light;        It is daybreak everywhere.

A clumsy hillock
Unmolded like a cake on the meadow
In the Laguna Mountains. Tough yellow-green grass growing up to a tree
As thick as a tooth. In winter, on the road from San Diego,   
Thousands of cars crawl up to the snow
And their passengers get out to investigate it
And then drive, discoursing, back home. And that’s California,   
Solemnly discharging its responsibilities. 
Meanwhile we breakfast on pancakes the size of a plate   
While the console radio goes on the blink.
Miss L’Espagnole looks out from her frame on the wall,   
Completely prepared (though for what it is impossible to say).   
Her left arm is white and dips into a puddle of fire
Or a pile of cotton on fire. And each thing is severe:   
The house hemmed in by pepper trees and Mexico
(This one is white and in Chula Vista), and the paraphernalia   
Strewn around home: a few magazines summing up politics,   
A matchbox with a lavender automobile on the cover,
And a set of soldiers of several military epochs marching off to war on the raffia rug.
Unless, you’ve grown up amidst palm trees (and buildings that are either unbuilt, or hospitals)
It’s impossible to appreciate a reasonable tree. 
      I sometimes consider the parrots that live in the zoo
      And are sold on the street in Tijuana. Colored like national flags,
      Their heads are always cocked to pick up something behind them. 
And unless you have lived in a place where the fog
Closes in like a face, it is impossible to be (even temporarily) relieved
When it lifts to expose the freshly painted trim of the city, and it seems
Like a fine day for knowledge: sunlight sleeping on top of the rocks   
And lots of white clouds scudding by like clean sheets
Which, when the air in the bedroom is cold, you pull over your head
And let the temperature slowly increase while you breathe.   
But California has only a coast in common with this.

In bed I muse on Tenier’s boors, Embrowned and beery losels all:       A wakeful brain       Elaborates pain: Within low doors the slugs of boors Laze and yawn and doze again.  In dreams they doze, the drowsy boors, Their hazy hovel warm and small:       Thought’s ampler bound       But chill is found: Within low doors the basking boors Snugly hug the ember-mound.  Sleepless, I see the slumberous boors Their blurred eyes blink, their eyelids fall:       Thought’s eager sight       Aches—overbright! Within low doors the boozy boors Cat-naps take in pipe-bowl light.

Ah! What avails the classic bent
   And what the cultured word,
Against the undoctored incident
   That actually occurred?

^^EOP^^

They had hit Ruben
with the high beams, had blinded
him so that the van
he was driving, full of Mexicans
going to pick tomatoes,
would have to stop. Ruben spun 
the van into an irrigation ditch,
spun the five-year-old me awake
to immigration officers,
their batons already out,
already looking for the soft spots on the body,
to my mother being handcuffed
and dragged to a van, to my father
trying to show them our green cards. 
They let us go. But Alvaro
was going back.
So was his brother Fernando.
So was their sister Sonia. Their mother
did not escape,
and so was going back. Their father
was somewhere in the field,
and was free. There were no great truths 
revealed to me then. No wisdom
given to me by anyone. I was a child
who had seen what a piece of polished wood
could do to a face, who had seen his father
about to lose the one he loved, who had lost
some friends who would never return,
who, later that morning, bent
to the earth and went to work.

It is the right time for hallucinations.
Drowning in a sty, the sailor
feels the ocean’s buoyancy.
Dying in a web, the moth
discards its wings and falls free. 
I wish something would put its hands on me,
give me stronger poison and then stronger.
The beautiful flotillas do not stop.
Undying love drifts and delays.
I am capsizing. 
Great joy lingers still.
Nothing can be said for suffering.
It is legible only to strangers
and at great distances. It detests
survivors. It drapes gun-carriages 
with flowers, lampposts with hanging boys.
It is the right time for hallucinations,
most nakedly of inmost west.
Her death would be less tender now,
dusted over with charity, 
a web of useless wings, a shallow sty.
She gave me stronger poison and then stronger.
I miss her.
In the back seat of the taxi,
dark breathlessness says “Hurry, hurry.”


^^EOP^^

Whose was that gentle voice, that, whispering sweet,       Promised methought long days of bliss sincere!       Soothing it stole on my deluded ear, Most like soft music, that might sometimes cheat Thoughts dark and drooping! ’Twas the voice of Hope.       Of love and social scenes, it seemed to speak,       Of truth, of friendship, of affection meek; That, oh! poor friend, might to life’s downward slope Lead us in peace, and bless our latest hours.       Ah me! the prospect saddened as she sung;       Loud on my startled ear the death-bell rung; Chill darkness wrapt the pleasurable bowers, Whilst Horror, pointing to yon breathless clay, “No peace be thine,” exclaimed, “away, away!”

I saw a ship of martial build(Her standards set, her brave apparel on)Directed as by madness mereAgainst a stolid iceberg steer,Nor budge it, though the infatuate ship went down.The impact made huge ice-cubes fallSullen, in tons that crashed the deck;But that one avalanche was all—No other movement save the foundering wreck.
Along the spurs of ridges pale,Not any slenderest shaft and frail,A prism over glass-green gorges lone,Toppled; or lace of traceries fine,Nor pendant drops in grot or mineWere jarred, when the stunned ship went down.Nor sole the gulls in cloud that wheeledCircling one snow-flanked peak afar,But nearer fowl the floes that skimmedAnd crystal beaches, felt no jar.No thrill transmitted stirred the lockOf jack-straw needle-ice at base;Towers undermined by waves—the blockAtilt impending—kept their place.Seals, dozing sleek on sliddery ledgesSlipt never, when by loftier edgesThrough very inertia overthrown,The impetuous ship in bafflement went down.
Hard Berg (methought), so cold, so vast,With mortal damps self-overcast;Exhaling still thy dankish breath—Adrift dissolving, bound for death;Though lumpish thou, a lumbering one—A lumbering lubbard loitering slow,Impingers rue thee and go down,Sounding thy precipice below,Nor stir the slimy slug that sprawlsAlong thy dead indifference of walls.

                                        1. Spleen
It is highly vascular, that is
to say gifted; of the superior range
and more, no one is smart enough
to test its limits. No one
is God; God is not God. 
The spleen is at the cardiac end
of the stomach, a fine neighborhood
patrolled by lymphocytes, white or colorless
nucleate cells that maintain immunity
to infection and resistance against bacteria
and other foreign entities except euphemisms.
O marvelous reservoir of blood, 
red collection so gaudy it is fetish.
Worn-out erythrocytes the spleen destroys
and therefore eventually all the household
cells that submit to local drudgery, the carrying
of oxygen and hemoglobin they can’t keep, and that’s
how you get black bile, the melancholy next to mirth. 
                                        2. Liver
This is all the advice M_______ could manage
when they came for Ethyl: 
Don’t hold it in your hand for it could be
drunk and not responsible and using that cover.
Beware the liver fluke, it is nothing but mistake,
nothing but parasite. Remember that the liver
does everything in the name of metabolism,
everything it does for Bolsheviks, for Nazis
and punks. 
You will still be Ethyl when they call you C2H5OH
and send you to the liver. Do not be easy; you
owe that to womanhood, so wreck what you can.
To think that the first time you leave home
it’s a little trip to the system.
Darling Ethyl, readiness has never mattered. 
                                          3. Heart-to-heart Talk
—Have a heart and a nice day. 
—Thank you. I have put the heart
in my mouth; is that the right place? 
—Here; how about a change of heart? 
—No; I haven’t quite finished this one
on my sleeve. 
—So it’s that way, is it? I suspect
you're after my own heart. 
—Oh no; you know I don’t have the heart
to do that. You know me by heart; remember?
Please believe me; I’m swearing with all my heart. 
—Really? Well, I believe that came from
the bottom of your heart, close to the dregs,
the liver and spleen, not the creamy brain.

(for my daughter)



Composed in a shine of laughing, Monique brings in sacks
of groceries, unloads them, straightens, and stretches her back. 
The child was a girl, the girl is a woman; the shift   
is subtle and absolute, worn like a gift. 
The woman, once girl once child, now is deft in her ease,   
is door to the forum, is cutter of keys. 
In space that her torque and lift have prefigured and set free   
between her mother and her child the woman stands   
having emptied her hands.

When I ran, it rained. Late in the afternoon—
midsummer, upstate New York, mornings I wrote,
read Polish history, and there was a woman
whom I thought about; outside the moody, humid
American sublime—late in the afternoon,
toward sundown, just as the sky was darkening,
the light came up and redwings settled in the cattails.
They were death's idea of twilight, the whole notes
of a requiem the massed clouds croaked
above the somber fields. Lady of eyelashes,
do you hear me? Whiteness, otter's body,
coolness of the morning, rubbed amber
and the skin's salt, do you hear me? This is Poland speaking,
“era of the dawn of freedom,” nineteen twenty-two.

My father liked them separate, one there,
one here (allá y aquí), as if aware 
that words might cut in two his daughter’s heart
(el corazón) and lock the alien part 
to what he was—his memory, his name
(su nombre)—with a key he could not claim. 
“English outside this door, Spanish inside,”
he said, “y basta.” But who can divide 
the world, the word (mundo y palabra) from
any child? I knew how to be dumb 
and stubborn (testaruda); late, in bed,
I hoarded secret syllables I read 
until my tongue (mi lengua) learned to run
where his stumbled. And still the heart was one. 
I like to think he knew that, even when,
proud (orgulloso) of his daughter’s pen, 
he stood outside mis versos, half in fear
of words he loved but wanted not to hear.

Foreseeing typographical errors
on their gravestones, the children
from infancy—are bitter.
Little clairvoyants, blond, in terror. 
Foreseeing the black and yellow
room behind the eyelids, the children
are bitter—from infancy.
The blue egg of thirst: say hello. 
Foreseeing the lower lips of glaciers
sliding toward their own lips, the children
from infancy—are bitter.
Them, rats, snakes: the chased and chasers. 
Foreseeing a dust-filled matchbox, the heart,
the temples’ temples closing, the children
are bitter—from infancy.
From the marrow in the marrow: the start.

A boy who knew enough to save for something
like the whim that took me downtown on the bus
one lost Saturday morning of my mother’s birthday,
I sat in the back where the gasoline smell
made me dizzy and I closed my eyes but didn’t
think of her, only of myself, basking in the light
and love that would fall down on me when I
handed her the box and she untied the bow to save
and lifted something shining out and held it up before us
like a promise taking shape for once in her hands,
though I didn’t know what to buy, the bus door
hissing behind me because I’m in some kind of
state now, a trance that comes when you pull
at the cords of light that connect the mother to the boy,
the 1959 department store
opening up before me like a jeweled city.
In lingerie I found myself
surrounded by those torsos sheened in silk,
dreaming my mother, feeling the silk against me,
the two of us moving through a cloudy room
in a dance I can’t remember until shame comes.
From out of nowhere the matron frowned,
asked what I wanted, hovered over me.
Confused and afraid I whispered, without thinking,
The black hose with rhinestones down the seams please
and pointed to the pair across the room
stretched over legs on the glass counter
as if about to step off
and I saw her in my mind slip them on,
her skirt hiked above the garters, the sun
catching in her tangled hair
until the matron made a sound in her throat
and looked at me with eyes that said
What’s wrong with you dirty boy. 
All the way home a sweet ache rocked me,
the silver package riding my lap
like a heavy wrong thing
I couldn’t give up no matter how it
dragged me down to a place
where I could barely breathe or see or feel.
Whatever happened that spinning afternoon—
she ran her fingers over the rhinestone seams
or she didn’t, she wore them out into an evening
or kept them forever in her drawer of impossible things—
doesn’t matter. I would find my way into the light
of another woman into whose arms I fall
nights my fingers can’t tear through the dark
that eats me, the silk stretched across her breasts,
the need for something womanly to raise me up
pounding in my head until I curl in sleep
away from those longings, ancient and blue.


^^EOP^^

I have sown beside all waters in my day.
I planted deep, within my heart the fear
that wind or fowl would take the grain away.
I planted safe against this stark, lean year. 
I scattered seed enough to plant the land
in rows from Canada to Mexico
but for my reaping only what the hand
can hold at once is all that I can show. 
Yet what I sowed and what the orchard yields
my brother's sons are gathering stalk and root;
small wonder then my children glean in fields
they have not sown, and feed on bitter fruit.

It snakes behind me, this invisible chain gang—
the aliases, your many faces peopling 
that vast hotel, the past. What did we learn?
Every twenty minutes the elevated train, 
the world shuddering beyond
the pane. It was never warm enough in winter. 
The walls peeled, the color of corsages
ruined in the air. Sweeping the floor, 
my black wig on the chair. I never meant
to leave you in that hotel where the voices 
of patrons long gone seemed to echo in the halls,
a scent of spoiled orchids. But this was never 
an elegant hotel. The iron fretwork of the El
held each room in a deep corrosive bloom. 
This was the bankrupt’s last chance, the place
the gambler waits to learn his black mare’s 
leg snapped as she hurtled towards the finish line. 
* * * 
How did we live? Your face over my shoulder
was the shade of mahogany in the speckled 
mirror bolted to the wall. It was never warm.
You arrived through a forest of needles, 
the white mist of morphine, names for sleep
that never came. My black wig unfurled 
across the battered chair. Your arms circled me
when I stood by the window. Downstairs 
the clerk who read our palms broke the seal
on another deck of cards. She said you’re my fate, 
my sweet annihilating angel, every naked hotel room
I’ve ever checked out of. There’s nothing 
left of that, but even now when night pulls up
like a limousine, sea-blue, and I’m climbing the stairs, 
keys in hand, I’ll reach the landing and
you’re there—the one lesson I never get right. 
Trains hurtled by, extinguished somewhere
past the bend of midnight. The shuddering world. 
Your arms around my waist. I never meant to leave.  
* * * 
Of all that, there's nothing left but a grid
of shadows the El tracks throw over the street, 
the empty lot. Gone, the blistered sills,
voices that rilled across each wall. Gone, 
the naked bulb swinging from the ceiling,
that chicanery of light that made your face 
a brief eclipse over mine. How did we live?
The mare broke down. I was your fate, that 
yellow train, the plot of sleet, through dust
crusted on the pane. It wasn't warm enough. 
What did we learn? All I have left of you
is this burnt place on my arm. So, I won't 
forget you even when I'm nothing but
small change in the desk clerk's palm, nothing 
but the pawn ticket crumpled in your pocket,
the one you'll never redeem. Whatever I meant 
to say loses itself in the bend of winter
towards extinction, this passion of shadows falling 
like black orchids through the air. I never meant
to leave you there by the pane, that 
terminal hotel, the world shuddering with trains.

Darkened by time, the masters, like our memories, mix   
And mismatch,
                             and settle about our lawn furniture, like air   
Without a meaning, like air in its clear nothingness.
What can we say to either of them?
How can they be so dark and so clear at the same time?   
They ruffle our hair,
                                        they ruffle the leaves of the August trees.   
Then stop, abruptly as wind.
The flies come back, and the heat—

Nothing is endless but the sky.
The flies come back, and the afternoon
Teeters a bit on its green edges,
                                                           then settles like dead weight   
Next to our memories, and the pale hems of the masters’ gowns.

Where pain puts them, an inch-and-a-half above the floor.   
And some will revile him out of love

The gates of mercy, like an eclipse, darken our undersides.   
Rows of gravestones stay our steps,

Bright as auras around our bodies.
And some will utter the words,
                                                         speaking in fear and tongues,   
Hating their garments splotched by the flesh.
These are the lucky ones, the shelved ones, the twice-erased.

Nobody in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries,   
Blackberries on either side, though on the right mainly,
A blackberry alley, going down in hooks, and a sea
Somewhere at the end of it, heaving. Blackberries
Big as the ball of my thumb, and dumb as eyes
Ebon in the hedges, fat
With blue-red juices. These they squander on my fingers.
I had not asked for such a blood sisterhood; they must love me.
They accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides. 
Overhead go the choughs in black, cacophonous flocks—
Bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky.
Theirs is the only voice, protesting, protesting.
I do not think the sea will appear at all.
The high, green meadows are glowing, as if lit from within.
I come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies,
Hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a Chinese screen.
The honey-feast of the berries has stunned them; they believe in heaven.   
One more hook, and the berries and bushes end. 
The only thing to come now is the sea.
From between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me,   
Slapping its phantom laundry in my face.
These hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt.
I follow the sheep path between them. A last hook brings me   
To the hills’ northern face, and the face is orange rock   
That looks out on nothing, nothing but a great space   
Of white and pewter lights, and a din like silversmiths   
Beating and beating at an intractable metal.

dissolve no margins, stop no savory sanctities.) 
Mary is
a rose in a whiskey glass. 
Mary’s
Februaries shudder and are gone. Aprils   
fret frankly, lilac hurries on.
Summer is a hard irregular ridge.
October looks away.
And that’s the Year!
                     Save for her bugle-love.   
Save for the bleat of not-obese devotion.
Save for Somebody Terribly Dying, under
the philanthropy of robins. Save for her Ranger   
bringing
an amount of rainbow in a string-drawn bag.   
“Where did you get the diamond?” Do not ask:   
but swallow, straight, the spirals of his flask   
and assist him at your zipper; pet his lips
and help him clutch you. 
Love’s another departure.
Will there be any arrivals, confirmations?   
Will there be gleaning? 
Mary, the Shakedancer’s child
from the rooming-flat, pants carefully, peers at   
her laboring lover ....
                     Mary! Mary Ann!
Settle for sandwiches! settle for stocking caps!   
for sudden blood, aborted carnival,
the props and niceties of non-loneliness—
the rhymes of Leaning.


^^EOP^^

The little girl won’t eat her sandwich;
she lifts the bun and looks in, but the grey beef   
       coated with relish is always there.   
       Her mother says, “Do it for mother.”
Milk and relish and a hard bun that comes off   
       like a hat—a kid’s life is a cinch. 
       And a mother’s life? “What can you do
with a man like that?” she asks the sleeping cook   
       and then the old Negro who won’t sit.   
       “He’s been out all night trying to get it.
I hope he gets it. What did he ever do
       but get it?” The Negro doesn’t look, 
       though he looks like he’s been out all night
trying. Everyone’s been out all night trying.   
       Why else would we be drinking beer   
       at attention? If she were younger,
or if I were Prince Valiant, I would say that fate
       brought me here to quiet the crying, 
       to sweeten the sandwich of the child,
to waken the cook, to stop the Negro from   
       bearing witness to the world. The dawn   
       still hasn’t come, and now we hear
the 8 o’clock whistles blasting from heaven,   
       and with no morning the day is sold.


^^EOP^^

You could drive blind
for those two seconds
and they would be forever.
I think that as a diesel truck
passes us eight miles east of Mission.
Churning through the storm, heedless
of the hill sliding away.
There isn’t much use to curse but I do.
Words fly away, tumbling invisibly
toward the unseen point where
the prairie and sky meet.
The road is like that in those seconds,
nothing but the blind white side
of creation. 
                   You’re there somewhere,
a tiny struggling cell.
You just might be significant
but you might not be anything.
Forever is a space of split time
from which to recover after the mass passes.
My curse flies out there somewhere,
and then I send my prayer into the wake
of the diesel truck headed for Sioux Falls
one hundred and eighty miles through the storm.


^^EOP^^

Crude seeing’s all our joy: could we discern
The cold dark infinite vast where atoms burn
—Lone suns—in flesh, our treasure and our play,
Who’d dare to breathe this fern-thick bird-rich day?


^^EOP^^

“A true Arab knows how to catch a fly in his hands,”
my father would say. And he’d prove it,
cupping the buzzer instantly
while the host with the swatter stared. 
In the spring our palms peeled like snakes.
True Arabs believed watermelon could heal fifty ways.
I changed these to fit the occasion. 
Years before, a girl knocked,
wanted to see the Arab.
I said we didn’t have one.
After that, my father told me who he was,
“Shihab”—“shooting star”—
a good name, borrowed from the sky.
Once I said, “When we die, we give it back?”
He said that’s what a true Arab would say. 
Today the headlines clot in my blood.
A little Palestinian dangles a truck on the front page.
Homeless fig, this tragedy with a terrible root
is too big for us. What flag can we wave?
I wave the flag of stone and seed,
table mat stitched in blue. 
I call my father, we talk around the news.
It is too much for him,
neither of his two languages can reach it.
I drive into the country to find sheep, cows,
to plead with the air:
Who calls anyone civilized? 
Where can the crying heart graze?
What does a true Arab do now?


^^EOP^^

It is not bad.  Let them play.
Let the guns bark and the bombing-plane
Speak his prodigious blasphemies.
It is not bad, it is high time,
Stark violence is still the sire of all the world’s values. 
What but the wolf’s tooth whittled so fine
The fleet limbs of the antelope?
What but fear winged the birds, and hunger
Jewelled with such eyes the great goshawk’s head?
Violence has been the sire of all the world’s values. 
Who would remember Helen’s face
Lacking the terrible halo of spears?
Who formed Christ but Herod and Caesar,
The cruel and bloody victories of Caesar?
Violence, the bloody sire of all the world’s values. 
Never weep, let them play,
Old violence is not too old to beget new values.

The houses those suburbs could afford
were roofed with old savings books, and some   
seeped gravy at stitches in their walls; 
some were clipped as close as fury,
some grimed and corner-bashed by love   
and the real estate, as it got more vacant, 
grew blady grass and blowfly grass, so called   
for the exquisite lanterns of its seed,   
and the land sagged subtly to a low point, 
it all inclined way out there to a pit   
with burnt-looking cheap marble edges   
and things and figures flew up from it 
like the stones in the crusher Piers had   
for making dusts of them for glazes:
flint, pyroclase, slickensides, quartz, schist, 
snapping, refusing, and spitting high
till the steel teeth got gritty corners on them   
and could grip them craw-chokingly to grind. 
It’s their chance, a man with beerglass-cut arms   
told me. Those hoppers got to keep filled. A girl,   
edging in, bounced out cropped and wrong-coloured 
like a chemist’s photo, crying. Who could blame her   
among in-depth grabs and Bali flights and phones?   
She was true, and got what truth gets.


^^EOP^^

Farmhouses curl like horns of plenty, hide   
scrawny bare shanks against a barn, or crouch   
empty in the shadow of a mountain. Here   
there is no house at all— 
only the bones of a house,
lilacs growing beside them,
roses in clumps between them,   
honeysuckle over;
a gap for a door, a chimney
mud-chinked, an immense fireplace,   
the skeleton of a pine, 
and gandy dancers working on the rails
that run not thirty yards from the once door. 
I heard a gandy dancer playing on a jew’s harp    Where is now that merry party I remember long ago?   
Nelly was a lady ... 

^^EOP^^

Up there on the mountain road, the fireworks
blistered and subsided, for once at eye level:
spatter of light like water flicked from the fingers;
the brief emergent pattern; and after the afterimage bled
from the night sky, a delayed and muffled thud
that must have seemed enormous down below,
the sound concomitant with the arranged
threat of fire above the bleachers.
I stood as tall and straight as possible,
trying to compensate, trying not to lean in my friend’s
direction. Beside me, correcting height, he slouched
his shoulders, knees locked, one leg stuck out
to form a defensive angle with the other.
Thus we were most approximate
and most removed.
                         In the long pauses
between explosions, he’d signal conversation
by nodding vaguely toward the ragged pines.
I said my children would have loved the show.
He said we were watching youth at a great distance,
and I thought how the young
are truly boring, unvaried as they are
by the deep scar of doubt, the constant afterimage
of regret—no major tension in their bodies, no tender
hesitation, they don’t yet know
that this is so much work, scraping
from the self its multiple desires; don’t yet know
fatigue with self, the hunger for obliteration
that wakes us in the night at the dead hour
and fuels good sex. 
                            Of course I didn’t say it.
I realized he watched the fireworks
with the cool attention he had turned on women
dancing in the bar, a blunt uninvested gaze
calibrating every moving part, thighs,
breasts, the muscles of abandon.
I had wanted that gaze on me.
And as the evening dwindled to its nub,
its puddle of tallow, appetite without object,
as the men peeled off to seek
the least encumbered consolation
and the women grew expansive with regard—
how have I managed so long to stand among the paired
bodies, the raw pulsing music driving
loneliness into the air like scent,
and not be seized by longing,
not give anything to be summoned
into the larger soul two souls can make?
Watching the fireworks with my friend,
so little ease between us,
I see that I have armed myself;
fire changes everything it touches. 
Perhaps he has foreseen this impediment.
Perhaps when he holds himself within himself,
a sheathed angular figure at my shoulder,
he means to be protective less of him
than me, keeping his complicating rage
inside his body. And what would it solve
if he took one hand from his pocket,
risking touch, risking invitation—
if he took my hand it would not alter
this explicit sadness.
                                 The evening stalls,
the fireworks grow boring at this remove.
The traffic prowling the highway at our backs,
the couples, the families scuffling on the bank
must think us strangers to each other. Or,
more likely, with the celebrated fireworks thrusting
their brilliant repeating designs above the ridge,
we simply blur into the foreground,
like the fireflies dragging among the trees
their separate, discontinuous lanterns.


^^EOP^^

As if the sky during its emergence
—when it bubbled its way up out of the sand,
cooled and then sublimed into vapor
that blued the dank grey of the atmosphere—
left a residue of cobalt behind to remind 
from where it had sprung into existence,
the water rising from this spring
appears unearthly, as only things
close to earth, born of earth, can:   
its blue deeper than the heart of a sapphire. 
Today, when faced with such a spectacle,
we have, as usual, only two choices:   
the paralysis of awe, or the quick nonchalance
of acceptance. But what about the Spaniards   
who came upon this spring before there was 
a platform lined with inner tubes, before
there were wooden walkways elevated to slow
their impending rot, before their was a faux beach,
its sand stolen from the spring’s center?
Did they run in with their clothes on 
convinced that this was  the fountain of youth?
Did they laugh believing themselves
drunk, mad, asleep—dead, maybe?
That afternoon, late summer, we did not swim,
chose instead to wander out to the edge 
of the walkway, not a word between the two of us,
only the wind. Unlike us mere mortals, the trees
had long since been impressed,
preferring, instead, to maintain postures
incompatible with the work of sycophants.


^^EOP^^

Pretty boy, towel your tears,
And robe yourself in black.
Pretty boy, dry your tears,
You know I’m comin’ back.
I’m your lavish lover
And I’m slavish in the sack. 
Call me Sweet Potato,
Sweet Pea, or Sweety Pie,
There’s sugar on my lips
And honey in my thighs.
Jos’phine Baker bakes beans,
But I stew pigtails in rye. 
My bones are guitar strings
And blues the chords you strum.
My bones are slender flutes
And blues the bars you hum.
You wanna stay my man,
Serve me whisky when I come.


^^EOP^^

And is it stamina
that unseasonably freaks
forth a bluet, a
Quaker lady, by
the lake? So small,
a drop of sky that
splashed and held,
four-petaled, creamy
in its throat. The woods
around were brown,
the air crisp as a
Carr's table water
biscuit and smelt of
cider. There were frost
apples on the trees in
the field below the house.
The pond was still, then
broke into a ripple.
The hills, the leaves that
have not yet fallen
are deep and oriental
rug colors. Brown leaves
in the woods set off
gray trunks of trees.
But that bluet was
the focus of it all: last
spring, next spring, what
does it matter? Unexpected
as a tear when someone
reads a poem you wrote
for him: "It's this line
here." That bluet breaks
me up, tiny spring flower
late, late in dour October.

One of these days under the white   
clouds onto the white
lines of the goddamn PED
X-ING I shall be flattened,
and I shall spill my bag of discount   
medicines upon the avenue,
and an abruptly materializing bouquet   
of bums, retirees, and Mexican   
street-gangers will see all what   
kinds of diseases are enjoying me
and what kind of underwear and my little   
old lady’s legs spidery with veins.   
So Mr. Young and Lovely Negro Bus   
Driver I care exactly this: zero,   
that you see these things
now as I fling my shopping
up by your seat, putting
this left-hand foot way up
on the step so this dress rides up,   
grabbing this metal pole like
a beam of silver falling down
from Heaven to my aid, thank-you,   
hollering, “Watch det my medicine   
one second for me will you dolling,
I’m four feet and det’s a tall bus   
you got and it’s hot and I got
every disease they are making   
these days, my God, Jesus Christ,   
I’m telling you out of my soul.”

O beautiful was the werewolf   in his evil forest.   We took him to the carnival   and he started      crying when he saw the Ferris wheel.   Electric green and red tears   flowed down his furry cheeks.   He looked like a boat out on the dark   water.

Fräulein, can you     
                      sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I drag my sleeping bag
into the meadow’s precise center
& crawl inside, head first. Fräulein, there is the stars’
ceaseless drilling. I close my eyes. Somewhere below me
a star-nosed mole cuts its webbed hand
on a shard of glass. I close my ears
& over my body the current of a young doe
eddies, ripples across the field, a low-lying midnight fog
swirling after her, falling back, suspended. I know you are close.
The scar across my cheek burns. I think of reentering
                      your atmosphere,
                      your long, burning hair     
Don’t move. The slightest motion 
                      & this landscape, erased by floodlights

I. 
Isaiah awoke angry. 
Lapping at Isaiah’s ears black birdsong no it was anger.    
God had filled Isaiah’s ears with stingers. 
Once God and Isaiah were friends. 
God and Isaiah used to converse nightly, Isaiah would rush into the garden. 
They conversed under the Branch, night streamed down. 
From the sole of the foot to the head God would make Isaiah ring.    
Isaiah had loved God and now his love was turned to pain.    
Isaiah wanted a name for the pain, he called it sin. 
Now Isaiah was a man who believed he was a nation. 
Isaiah called the nation Judah and the sin Judah’s condition.    
Inside Isaiah God saw the worldsheet burning. 
Isaiah and God saw things differently, I can only tell you their actions. 
Isaiah addressed the nation.    
Man’s brittleness! cried Isaiah. 
The nation stirred in its husk and slept again. 
Two slabs of bloody meat lay folded on its eyes like wings.    
Like a hard glossy painting the nation slept. 
Who can invent a new fear? 
Yet I have invented sin, thought Isaiah, running his hand over the knobs. 
And then, because of a great attraction between them— 
which Isaiah fought (for and against) for the rest of his life— 
God shattered Isaiah’s indifference. 
God washed Isaiah’s hair in fire. 
God took the stay. 
From beneath its meat wings the nation listened.    
You, said Isaiah. 
No answer. 
I cannot hear you, Isaiah spoke again under the Branch.    
Light bleached open the night camera. 
God arrived. 
God smashed Isaiah like glass through every socket of his nation.    
Liar! said God. 
Isaiah put his hands on his coat, he put his hand on his face. 
Isaiah is a small man, said Isaiah, but no liar. 
God paused. 
And so that was their contract.    
Brittle on both sides, no lying. 
Isaiah’s wife came to the doorway, the doorposts had moved.    
What’s that sound? said Isaiah’s wife.    
The fear of the Lord, said Isaiah.    
He grinned in the dark, she went back inside.

1. About the Dead Man and Rigor Mortis 
The dead man thinks his resolve has stiffened when the
             ground dries.
Feeling the upward flow of moisture, the dead man thinks his
             resolve has stiffened.
The dead man’s will, will be done.
The dead man’s backbone stretches from rung to rung, from here to
             tomorrow, from a fabricated twinge to virtual agony.
The dead man’s disks along his spine are like stepping-stones across
             a lake, the doctor told him “jelly doughnuts” when they
             ruptured, this is better.
The dead man’s hernial groin is like a canvas bridge across a
             chasm, the doctor said “balloon” when they operated,
             this is better.
The dead man’s toes are like sanded free forms and his heels are as
             smooth as the backs of new shoes, the doctor said “corns”
             when they ached, this is better.
The dead man’s eyes are like tiny globes in water, continental
             geographies in microcosm, all the canyons are visible, now
             washed of random hairs that rooted, now free of the
             strangulated optics of retinal sense, this is better.
All the dead man’s organs, his skin, muscles, tendons, arteries, veins,
             valves, networks, relays—the whole shebang hums like a
             quickly deserted hardware store.
To the dead man, a head of cabbage is a forerunner of nutrients.
The dead man’s garden foreshadows the day it is to be plowed under,
             agriculture being one of the ancient Roman methods for
             burying the Classics, the other was war.
No one can argue with the dead man, he brooks no interference 
             between the lightning and ground, his determination
             is legendary.   2. More About the Dead Man and Rigor Mortis 
You think it’s funny, the dead man being stiff?
You think it’s an anatomically correct sexual joke?
You think it’s easy, being petrified?
You think it’s just one of those things, being turned to stone?
Who do you think turns the dead man to stone anyway?
Who do you think got the idea first?
You think it’s got a future, this being dead?
You think it’s in the cards, you think the thunder spoke?
You think he thought he was dead, or thought he fancied he was
             dead, or imagined he could think himself dead, or really
             knew he was dead?
You think he knew he knew?
You think it was predetermined?
You think when he stepped out of character he was different?
What the hell, what do you think?
You think it’s funny, the way the dead man is like lightning, going
             straight into the ground?
You think it’s hilarious, comedy upstanding, crackers to make
             sense of?

1. About the Beginnings of the Dead Man 
When the dead man throws up, he thinks he sees his inner life.
Seeing his vomit, he thinks he sees his inner life.
Now he can pick himself apart, weigh the ingredients, research 
             his makeup.
He wants to study things outside himself if he can find them.
Moving, the dead man makes the sound of bone on bone.
He bends a knee that doesn’t wish to bend, he raises an arm that
             argues with a shoulder, he turns his head by throwing it
             wildly to the side.
He envies the lobster the protective sleeves of its limbs.
He believes the jellyfish has it easy, floating, letting everything pass
             through it.
He would like to be a starfish, admired for its shape long after.
Everything the dead man said, he now takes back.
Not as a lively young man demonstrates sincerity or regret.
A young dead man and an old dead man are two different things.
A young dead man is oil, an old dead man is water.
A young dead man is bread and butter, an old dead man is bread and
             water—it’s a difference in construction, also architecture.
The dead man was there in the beginning: to the dead man, the sky
             is a crucible.
In the dead man’s lifetime, the planet has changed from lava to ash
             to cement.
But the dead man flops his feathers, he brings his wings up over
             his head and has them touch, he bends over with his beak
             to the floor, he folds and unfolds at the line where his
             armor creases.
The dead man is open to change and has deep pockets.
The dead man is the only one who will live forever.   2. More About the Beginnings of the Dead Man 
One day the dead man looked up into the crucible and saw the sun.
The dead man in those days held the sky like a small globe, like a
             patchwork ball, like an ultramarine bowl.
The dead man softened it, kneaded it, turned it and gave it volume.
He thrust a hand deep into it and shaped it from the inside out.
He blew into it and pulled it and stretched it until it became full-
             sized, a work of art created by a dead man.
The excellence of it, the quality, its character, its fundamental
             nature, its raison d‘être, its “it” were all indebted to the
             dead man. 
The dead man is the flywheel of the spinning planet.
The dead man thinks he can keep things the same by not moving.
By not moving, the dead man maintains the status quo at the center
             of change.
The dead man, by not moving, is an explorer: he follows his nose.
When it’s not personal, not profound, he can make a new
             world anytime.
The dead man is the future, was always the future, can never be
             the past.
Like God, the dead man existed before the beginning, a time marked
             by galactic static.
Now nothing remains of the first static that isn’t music, fashioned
             into melody by the accidents of interval.
Now nothing more remains of silence that isn’t sound.
The dead man has both feet in the past and his head in the clouds.

You never wrote the small green book like the poems of Edward Thomas. It was a book I dreamed. But watching the green report of your heart on the monitor it came to me as I stood like one of the doctors in my cap and gown, home, where you've lived like a bachelor at the far end of the house, there is a green diary: the book of the deer, the bear and the elk, with snapshots of Julian and Bob and Harry, old hunting friends dead as the game strung up on poles or drooped across fenders.  I think you are the only one left. And still you fight to stay, breathing the scorched air of the burn ward, the sweet stink of your own charred flesh. Stepfather, don't go. Seventy-three years is not the end of the book, the letters you never wrote, because even before you blistered your hands the act of writing pained you.  It took four shots to bring it down. Your father never praised you. Rising from dinner that night he beckoned toward the woodshed where the skinned deer hung draped in burlap. Then he whipped you with a belt. "Don't ever bring home meat shot up like that! One bullet is enough." I saw you kill a running buck at three hundred yards with one shot. It's a brutal art that fathers pass to sons.  When the propane tank ignited you took the flaming cylinder in your arms like a lover and fought it out the door. Now you dream each night of the trailer burning. My mother screams and beats the fire out of her hair. She was not burned like you— twice, and three times, for your care.  Now the deer are safe from us, I have one photograph to add to our book: a doe running through a field. My best shot. Somewhere in the grass behind her a fawn is hiding. You can't see it, but it's there waiting for its mother to draw us away. Later, she'll return and the two of them will be saved. Stepfather, Father, be like the fawn.

“It seems to me,” said Booker T.,
“It shows a mighty lot of cheek
To study chemistry and Greek
When Mister Charlie needs a hand
To hoe the cotton on his land,
And when Miss Ann looks for a cook,
Why stick your nose inside a book?” 
“I don’t agree,” said W.E.B.,
“If I should have the drive to seek
Knowledge of chemistry or Greek,
I’ll do it. Charles and Miss can look
Another place for hand or cook.
Some men rejoice in skill of hand,
And some in cultivating land,
But there are others who maintain
The right to cultivate the brain.” 
“It seems to me,” said Booker T.,
“That all you folks have missed the boat
Who shout about the right to vote,
And spend vain days and sleepless nights
In uproar over civil rights.
Just keep your mouths shut, do not grouse,
But work, and save, and buy a house.” 
“I don’t agree,” said W.E.B.,
“For what can property avail
If dignity and justice fail.
Unless you help to make the laws,
They’ll steal your house with trumped-up clause.
A rope’s as tight, a fire as hot,
No matter how much cash you’ve got.
Speak soft, and try your little plan,
But as for me, I’ll be a man.” 
“It seems to me,” said Booker T.—
“I don’t agree,”
Said W.E.B.

They gave the city a stroke. Its memories
are cordoned off. They could collapse on you. 
Water leaks into bricks of the Workers’ century   
and every meaning is blurred. No word in Roget 
now squares with another. If the word is Manchester
it may be Australia, where that means sheets and towels. 
To give the city a stroke, they mixed a lorryload
of henbane and meadowsweet oil and countrified her. 
Now Engels supports Max, and the British Union   
of beautiful ceramics is being shovelled up, 
blue-green tiles of the Corn Exchange,
umber gloss bricks of the Royal Midlands Hotel. 
Unmelting ice everywhere, and loosened molecules.
When the stroke came, every bottle winked at its neighbour.

I want to go to the other bank 
The river water alters the sky's colour
and alters me
I am in the current
my shadow stands by the river bank
like a tree struck by lightning 
I want to go to the other bank 
In the trees on the other bank
a solitary startled wood pigeon
flies towards me

Between the vision of the Tourist Board and the true   
Paradise lies the desert where Isaiah’s elations   
force a rose from the sand. The thirty-third canto 
cores the dawn clouds with concentric radiance,
the breadfruit opens its palms in praise of the bounty,    bois-pain, tree of bread, slave food, the bliss of John Clare, 
torn, wandering Tom, stoat-stroker in his county   
of reeds and stalk-crickets, fiddling the dank air,   
lacing his boots with vines, steering glazed beetles 
with the tenderest prods, knight of the cockchafer,   
wrapped in the mists of shires, their snail-horned steeples   
palms opening to the cupped pool—but his soul safer 
than ours, though iron streams fetter his ankles.   
Frost whitening his stubble, he stands in the ford
of a brook like the Baptist lifting his branches to bless 
cathedrals and snails, the breaking of this new day,
and the shadows of the beach road near which my mother lies,   
with the traffic of insects going to work anyway. 
The lizard on the white wall fixed on the hieroglyph   
of its stone shadow, the palms’ rustling archery,   
the souls and sails of circling gulls rhyme with:  “In la sua volont    è nostra pace,”
In His will is our peace. Peace in white harbours,   
in marinas whose masts agree, in crescent melons 
left all night in the fridge, in the Egyptian labours
of ants moving boulders of sugar, words in this sentence,
shadow and light, who live next door like neighbours, 
and in sardines with pepper sauce. My mother lies
near the white beach stones, John Clare near the sea-almonds,   
yet the bounty returns each daybreak, to my surprise, 
to my surprise and betrayal, yes, both at once.
I am moved like you, mad Tom, by a line of ants;   
I behold their industry and they are giants.  
         ii 
There on the beach, in the desert, lies the dark well
where the rose of my life was lowered, near the shaken plants,   
near a pool of fresh tears, tolled by the golden bell 
of allamanda, thorns of the bougainvillea, and that is
their bounty! They shine with defiance from weed and flower,   
even those that flourish elsewhere, vetch, ivy, clematis, 
on whom the sun now rises with all its power,   
not for the Tourist Board or for Dante Alighieri,
but because there is no other path for its wheel to take 
except to make the ruts of the beach road an allegory
of this poem’s career, of yours, that she died for the sake
of a crowning wreath of false laurel; so, John Clare, forgive me, 
for this morning’s sake, forgive me, coffee, and pardon me,   
milk with two packets of artificial sugar,
as I watch these lines grow and the art of poetry harden me 
into sorrow as measured as this, to draw the veiled figure   
of Mamma entering the standard elegiac.
No, there is grief, there will always be, but it must not madden, 
like Clare, who wept for a beetle’s loss, for the weight   
of the world in a bead of dew on clematis or vetch,
and the fire in these tinder-dry lines of this poem I hate 
as much as I love her, poor rain-beaten wretch,   
redeemer of mice, earl of the doomed protectorate   
of cavalry under your cloak; come on now, enough!  
         iii 
Bounty!
          In the bells of tree-frogs with their steady clamour   
in the indigo dark before dawn, the fading morse   
of fireflies and crickets, then light on the beetle’s armour, 
and the toad’s too-late presages, nettles of remorse
that shall spring from her grave from the spade’s heartbreak.   
And yet not to have loved her enough is to love more, 
if I confess it, and I confess it. The trickle of underground   
springs, the babble of swollen gulches under drenched ferns,   
loosening the grip of their roots, till their hairy clods 
like unclenching fists swirl wherever the gulch turns   
them, and the shuddering aftermath bends the rods   
of wild cane. Bounty in the ant’s waking fury, 
in the snail’s chapel stirring under wild yams,   
praise in decay and process, awe in the ordinary
in wind that reads the lines of the breadfruit’s palms 
in the sun contained in a globe of the crystal dew,   
bounty in the ants’ continuing a line of raw flour,   
mercy on the mongoose scuttling past my door, 
in the light’s parallelogram laid on the kitchen floor,   
for Thine is the Kingdom, the Glory, and the Power,
the bells of Saint Clement’s in the marigolds on the altar, 
in the bougainvillea’s thorns, in the imperial lilac   
and the feathery palms that nodded at the entry   
into Jerusalem, the weight of the world on the back 
of an ass; dismounting, He left His cross there for sentry   
and sneering centurion; then I believed in His Word,
in a widow’s immaculate husband, in pews of brown wood, 
when the cattle-bell of the chapel summoned our herd
into the varnished stalls, in whose rustling hymnals I heard   
the fresh Jacobean springs, the murmur Clare heard 
of bounty abiding, the clear language she taught us,   
“as the hart panteth,” at this, her keen ears pronged   
while her three fawns nibbled the soul-freshening waters, 
“as the hart panteth for the water-brooks” that belonged   
to the language in which I mourn her now, or when
I showed her my first elegy, her husband’s, and then her own.  
         iv 
But can she or can she not read this? Can you read this,   
Mamma, or hear it? If I took the pulpit, lay-preacher   
like tender Clare, like poor Tom, so that look, Miss! 
the ants come to you like children, their beloved teacher   
Alix, but unlike the silent recitation of the infants,
the choir that Clare and Tom heard in their rainy county, 
we have no solace but utterance, hence this wild cry.
Snails move into harbour, the breadfruit plants on the Bounty
will be heaved aboard, and the white God is Captain Bligh. 
Across white feathery grave-grass the shadow of the soul   
passes, the canvas cracks open on the cross-trees of the Bounty,   
and the Trades lift the shrouds of the resurrected sail. 
All move in their passage to the same mother-country,   
the dirt-clawing weasel, the blank owl or sunning seal.   
Faith grows mutinous. The ribbed body with its cargo 
stalls in its doldrums, the God-captain is cast adrift
by a mutinous Christian, in the wake of the turning Argo
plants bob in the ocean’s furrows, their shoots dip and lift, 
and the soul’s Australia is like the New Testament   
after the Old World, the code of an eye for an eye;   
the horizon spins slowly and Authority’s argument 
diminishes in power, in the longboat with Captain Bligh.   
This was one of your earliest lessons, how the Christ-Son   
questions the Father, to settle on another island, haunted by Him, 
by the speck of a raging deity on the ruled horizon,   
diminishing in meaning and distance, growing more dim:   
all these predictable passages that we first disobey 
before we become what we challenged; but you never altered   
your voice, either sighing or sewing, you would pray   
to your husband aloud, pedalling the hymns we all heard 
in the varnished pew: “There Is a Green Hill Far Away,”   
“Jerusalem the Golden.” Your melody faltered   
but never your faith in the bounty which is His Word.  
         v 
All of these waves crepitate from the culture of Ovid,   
its sibilants and consonants; a universal metre   
piles up these signatures like inscriptions of seaweed 
that dry in the pungent sun, lines ruled by mitre   
and laurel, or spray swiftly garlanding the forehead   
of an outcrop (and I hope this settles the matter 
of presences). No soul was ever invented,
yet every presence is transparent; if I met her
(in her nightdress ankling barefoot, crooning to the shallows), 
should I call her shadow that of a pattern invented   
by Graeco-Roman design, columns of shadows   
cast by the Forum, Augustan perspectives— 
poplars, casuarina-colonnades, the in-and-out light of almonds   
made from original Latin, no leaf but the olive’s?   
Questions of pitch. Faced with seraphic radiance 
(don’t interrupt!), mortals rub their skeptical eyes   
that hell is a beach-fire at night where embers dance,   
with temporal fireflies like thoughts of Paradise; 
but there are inexplicable instincts that keep recurring   
not from hope or fear only, that are real as stones,
the faces of the dead we wait for as ants are transferring 
their cities, though we no longer believe in the shining ones.   
I half-expect to see you no longer, then more than half,   
almost never, or never then—there I have said it— 
but felt something less than final at the edge of your grave,   
some other something somewhere, equally dreaded,   
since the fear of the infinite is the same as death, 
unendurable brightness, the substantial dreading   
its own substance, dissolving to gases and vapours,   
like our dread of distance; we need a horizon, 
a dividing line that turns the stars into neighbours
though infinity separates them, we can think of only one sun:   
all I am saying is that the dread of death is in the faces 
we love, the dread of our dying, or theirs;
therefore we see in the glint of immeasurable spaces   
not stars or falling embers, not meteors, but tears.  
         vi 
The mango trees serenely rust when they are in flower,   
nobody knows the name for that voluble cedar
whose bell-flowers fall, the pomme-arac purples its floor. 
The blue hills in late afternoon always look sadder.   
The country night waiting to come in outside the door;   
the firefly keeps striking matches, and the hillside fumes 
with a bluish signal of charcoal, then the smoke burns   
into a larger question, one that forms and unforms,   
then loses itself in a cloud, till the question returns. 
Buckets clatter under pipes, villages begin at corners.
A man and his trotting dog come back from their garden.
The sea blazes beyond the rust roofs, dark is on us 
before we know it. The earth smells of what’s done,   
small yards brighten, day dies and its mourners
begin, the first wreath of gnats; this was when we sat down 
on bright verandahs watching the hills die. Nothing is trite   
once the beloved have vanished; empty clothes in a row,   
but perhaps our sadness tires them who cherished delight; 
not only are they relieved of our customary sorrow,   
they are without hunger, without any appetite,
but are part of earth’s vegetal fury; their veins grow 
with the wild mammy-apple, the open-handed breadfruit,   
their heart in the open pomegranate, in the sliced avocado;   
ground-doves pick from their palms; ants carry the freight 
of their sweetness, their absence in all that we eat,   
their savour that sweetens all of our multiple juices,
their faith that we break and chew in a wedge of cassava, 
and here at first is the astonishment: that earth rejoices   
in the middle of our agony, earth that will have her
for good: wind shines white stones and the shallows’ voices.  
         vii 
In spring, after the bear’s self-burial, the stuttering   
crocuses open and choir, glaciers shelve and thaw,   
frozen ponds crack into maps, green lances spring 
from the melting fields, flags of rooks rise and tatter   
the pierced light, the crumbling quiet avalanches   
of an unsteady sky; the vole uncoils and the otter 
worries his sleek head through the verge’s branches;   
crannies, culverts, and creeks roar with wrist-numbing water.   
Deer vault invisible hurdles and sniff the sharp air, 
squirrels spring up like questions, berries easily redden,   
edges delight in their own shapes (whoever their shaper).   
But here there is one season, our viridian Eden 
is that of the primal garden that engendered decay,   
from the seed of a beetle’s shard or a dead hare   
white and forgotten as winter with spring on its way. 
There is no change now, no cycles of spring, autumn, winter,   
nor an island’s perpetual summer; she took time with her;   
no climate, no calendar except for this bountiful day. 
As poor Tom fed his last crust to trembling birds,
as by reeds and cold pools John Clare blest these thin musicians,   
let the ants teach me again with the long lines of words, 
my business and duty, the lesson you taught your sons,   
to write of the light’s bounty on familiar things
that stand on the verge of translating themselves into news: 
the crab, the frigate that floats on cruciform wings,
and that nailed and thorn riddled tree that opens its pews   
to the blackbird that hasn’t forgotten her because it sings.

Black maid, complain not that I fly, When Fate commands antipathy: Prodigious might that union prove, Where Night and Day together move, And the conjunction of our lips Not kisses make, but an eclipse, In which the mixed black and white Portends more terror than delight. Yet if my shadow thou wilt be, Enjoy thy dearest wish. But see Thou take my shadow’s property, That hastes away when I come nigh.     Else stay till death hath blinded me, And then I will bequeath myself to thee.

Shoulders knobbed against
a slat-backed chair,
the temples tugged, a pull 
at the nape, you felt the up-
sweep as she smoothed the fine
wisps back and tucked 
yank into yank
and a third into that
until the consecutive 
dodges of thumbs and first
fingers gathered,
fraying and filing 
to their end—ended
in an ornament that, suspended,
looked ridiculous, even 
on a child who mostly
set forth with
what was called 
a “finished” look, some
loose ends in order where
others were not 
and a slight weight below
the nape’s pull. The view
others had of it 
was invisible to you.
It made something there
where there would have been 
a blank—now instead
a kind of face
sent from woman to 
woman like a duty,
an obstinate
duty to pattern. 
It’s too simple to see
one thing rather
than another, a wish 
protruding once it’s been
suppressed, a vise that holds
a thought in its proper 
place until it bobs
to the surface
of a generally balmy 
sea. Women and
woman only a letter
away—a strand gets 
mixed, then mixed
right out of the heaven
of perfect fit; 
one kind of accident
turns into another.
The whole head throbs for days. 
Black and white are woven
into gray the way
hyperbole has no chance 
once it’s juxtaposed
to reason—negation
just a thread among 
the available options
and hope itself apparent
there in the very 
notion a made thing can last.
Tougher, coarser, split
weave in the years. Shorter, 
longer, shorter, the brain
bound to its anchor.
The brushed-out waves 
with their rick-rack
shadows, a thread
inside the case, 
the case inside
the locket, the locket
beneath the yoke. 
All the effort
to save in itself
a form of loss. 
You can tell a story
many ways. You can leave
something out or put 
something in; you can fool
yourself and hide.
You can shake out 
the form or try
to manage every wisp,
but the latter will 
only bring you pain.
You went under
the hand and eye of another 
and the tether cannot
be undone.

The darkness crumbles away.
It is the same old druid Time as ever,
Only a live thing leaps my hand,
A queer sardonic rat,
As I pull the parapet’s poppy
To stick behind my ear.
Droll rat, they would shoot you if they knew
Your cosmopolitan sympathies.
Now you have touched this English hand
You will do the same to a German
Soon, no doubt, if it be your pleasure
To cross the sleeping green between.
It seems you inwardly grin as you pass
Strong eyes, fine limbs, haughty athletes,
Less chanced than you for life,
Bonds to the whims of murder,
Sprawled in the bowels of the earth,
The torn fields of France.
What do you see in our eyes
At the shrieking iron and flame
Hurled through still heavens?
What quaver—what heart aghast?
Poppies whose roots are in man’s veins
Drop, and are ever dropping;
But mine in my ear is safe—
Just a little white with the dust.

The lump on his neck that no collar
could hide, and the charity of his presence
there in the neighborhood each fall,
door-to-door, standing in the swept porches,
waiting for the housewives to answer. 
The ugly, pitiable treeman, reddish and leathery
from the sun. His baseball cap pulled tight
over his head, the visor stiff as a beaver’s tail.
Year after year, the bowsaw with its wide
teeth and the long-handled toppers were all 
that announced his trade. And standing on the porch
he advised nothing, though he coughed and hacked,
covering his mouth with his sap-blackened fist
and waited for the infrequent yes that sent him
up the trunk and into the solid lap of the branches, 
where he clipped and sawed the bony leafless rigging
until the tree, all torso—lung and heart, ribs
and hips and shoulders—, stood like a knotted
goblet in the yard, a figure, as in allegory,
of his own stunted self, rooted, alive. 
My mother tried hard to convince us we were all
children of God and that the sick and maimed, the poor,
were creatures born to special destinies so unique
we could not understand. But who could understand
pain’s redemptiveness and how it rarely seemed 
to translate into grace. The poor were always poor,
the sick, sick—just as the treeman’s goiter
did not respond to treatment, inscrutable, part
of God’s plan, part of the unlovely element of love:
the humbling, the pity, the scar of violence— 
a craving too frightening to name, or too tender,
the way the treeman bundled the trimmings in twine
and hauled them to the alley. And as if he counted it
his real work, leaned against the fence and with his fingers
picked the dogged sap from the blade and with a file sharpened the teeth.

My desk is cleared of the litter of ages; Before me glitter the fair white pages; My fountain pen is clean and filled, And the noise of the office has long been stilled. Roget’s Thesaurus is at my hand, And I’m ready to do some work that’s grand, Dignified, eminent, great, momentous, Memorable, worthy of note, portentous, Beautiful, paramount, vital, prime, Stirring, eventful, august, sublime. For this is the way, I have read and heard, That authors look for the fitting word. All of the proud ingredients mine To build, like Marlowe, the mighty line. But never a line from my new-filled pen That couldn’t be done by a child of ten. Oh, how did Shelley and how did Keats Weave magic words on the fair white sheets Under conditions that, were they mine, I couldn’t bear? And I’d just resign. Yet Milton wrote passable literature Under conditions I couldn’t endure. Coleridge and Chatterton did their stuff Over a road that I’d christen rough. Wordsworth and—soft!—could it be that they Waited until they had something to say?

I stood on the bridge at midnight,    As the clocks were striking the hour, And the moon rose o'er the city,    Behind the dark church-tower.   I saw her bright reflection    In the waters under me, Like a golden goblet falling    And sinking into the sea.   And far in the hazy distance    Of that lovely night in June, The blaze of the flaming furnace    Gleamed redder than the moon.   Among the long, black rafters    The wavering shadows lay, And the current that came from the ocean    Seemed to lift and bear them away;   As, sweeping and eddying through them,    Rose the belated tide, And, streaming into the moonlight,    The seaweed floated wide.   And like those waters rushing    Among the wooden piers, A flood of thoughts came o’er me    That filled my eyes with tears.   How often, O, how often,    In the days that had gone by, I had stood on that bridge at midnight    And gazed on that wave and sky!   How often, O, how often,    I had wished that the ebbing tide Would bear me away on its bosom    O’er the ocean wild and wide!   For my heart was hot and restless,    And my life was full of care, And the burden laid upon me    Seemed greater than I could bear.   But now it has fallen from me,    It is buried in the sea; And only the sorrow of others    Throws its shadow over me.   Yet whenever I cross the river    On its bridge with wooden piers, Like the odor of brine from the ocean    Comes the thought of other years.   And I think how many thousands    Of care-encumbered men, Each bearing his burden of sorrow,    Have crossed the bridge since then.   I see the long procession    Still passing to and fro, The young heart hot and restless,    And the old subdued and slow!   And forever and forever,    As long as the river flows, As long as the heart has passions,    As long as life has woes;   The moon and its broken reflection    And its shadows shall appear, As the symbol of love in heaven,    And its wavering image here.

Fish
    always accurately know where to move and when,
    and likewise
    birds have an accurate built-in time sense
    and orientation. 
Humanity, however,
    lacking such instincts resorts to scientific
    research. Its nature is illustrated by the following
    occurrence. 
A certain soldier
    had to fire a cannon at six o’clock sharp every evening.
    Being a soldier he did so. When his accuracy was
    investigated he explained: 
I go by
    the absolutely accurate chronometer in the window
    of the clockmaker down in the city. Every day at seventeen
    forty-five I set my watch by it and
    climb the hill where my cannon stands ready.
    At seventeen fifty-nine precisely I step up to the cannon
    and at eighteen hours sharp I fire. 
And it was clear
    that this method of firing was absolutely accurate.
    All that was left was to check that chronometer. So
    the clockmaker down in the city was questioned about
    his instrument’s accuracy. 
Oh, said the clockmaker,
    this is one of the most accurate instruments ever. Just imagine,
    for many years now a cannon has been fired at six o’clock sharp.
    And every day I look at this chronometer
    and always it shows exactly six. 
Chronometers tick and cannon boom.

Given an old woman and given a barrow.
I.e. the system old woman O and barrow B. 
The system is moving from the paved yard Y to the corner C,
    from the corner C to the Stone S, from the stone S
    to the forest F, from the forest F to the horizon H. 
The horizon H is the point where vision ends
    and memory begins. 
Nevertheless the system is moving
    at a constant velocity v,
    along a constant path,
    through a constant destiny,
renewing its impulse and its meaning
    from within itself. 
A relatively independent system:
in landscapes from horizon to horizon
always just one old woman with a barrow. 
And thus we have, once and for all,
    that geodetic unit, the
    unit of travel there and back, the
    unit of autumn, the
    unit Our daily bread, the
    unit of wind and lowering sky, the
    unit of the distance home, the
    unit As we forgive them, the
    unit of nightfall, the
    unit of footsteps and dust, the
    unit of life-fulfillment Amen.

You take a kitchen-mallet
and a knife
and hit
the right spot, so it doesn’t jerk, for
jerking means only complications and reduces profit. 
And the watchers already narrow their eyes, already admire the   
            dexterity,
already reach for their purses. And paper is ready
for wrapping it up. And smoke rises from chimneys.
And Christmas peers from windows, creeps along the ground
and splashes in barrels. 
Such is the law of happiness. 
I am just wondering if the carp is the right creature. 
A far better creature surely would be one
which—stretched out—held flat—pinned down—
would turn its blue eye
on the mallet, the knife, the purse, the paper,
the watchers and the chimneys
and Christmas, 
And quickly 
say something. For instance 
These are my happiest days; these are my golden days.
Or
The starry sky above me and the moral law within me,
Or   
And yet it moves. 
Or at least
Hallelujah!

I 
Brag, sweet tenor bull,
descant on Rawthey’s madrigal,
each pebble its part
for the fells’ late spring.
Dance tiptoe, bull,
black against may.
Ridiculous and lovely
chase hurdling shadows
morning into noon.
May on the bull’s hide
and through the dale
furrows fill with may,
paving the slowworm’s way. 
A mason times his mallet
to a lark’s twitter,
listening while the marble rests,
lays his rule
at a letter’s edge,
fingertips checking,
till the stone spells a name
naming none,
a man abolished.
Painful lark, labouring to rise!
The solemn mallet says:
In the grave’s slot
he lies. We rot. 
Decay thrusts the blade,
wheat stands in excrement
trembling. Rawthey trembles.
Tongue stumbles, ears err
for fear of spring.
Rub the stone with sand,
wet sandstone rending
roughness away. Fingers
ache on the rubbing stone.
The mason says: Rocks
happen by chance.
No one here bolts the door,
love is so sore. 
Stone smooth as skin,
cold as the dead they load
on a low lorry by night.
The moon sits on the fell
but it will rain.
Under sacks on the stone
two children lie,
hear the horse stale,
the mason whistle,
harness mutter to shaft,
felloe to axle squeak,
rut thud the rim,
crushed grit. 
Stocking to stocking, jersey to jersey,
head to a hard arm,
they kiss under the rain,
bruised by their marble bed.
In Garsdale, dawn;
at Hawes, tea from the can.
Rain stops, sacks
steam in the sun, they sit up.
Copper-wire moustache,
sea-reflecting eyes
and Baltic plainsong speech
declare: By such rocks
men killed Bloodaxe. 
Fierce blood throbs in his tongue,
lean words.
Skulls cropped for steel caps
huddle round Stainmore.
Their becks ring on limestone,
whisper to peat.
The clogged cart pushes the horse downhill.
In such soft air
they trudge and sing,
laying the tune frankly on the air.
All sounds fall still,
feilside bleat,
hide-and-seek peewit. 
Her pulse their pace,
palm countering palm,
till a trench is filled,
stone white as cheese
jeers at the dale.
Knotty wood, hard to rive,
smoulders to ash;
smell of October apples.
The road again,
at a trot.
Wetter, warmed, they watch
the mason meditate
on name and date. 
Rain rinses the road,
the bull streams and laments.
Sour rye porridge from the hob
with cream and black tea,
meat, crust and crumb.
Her parents in bed
the children dry their clothes.
He has untied the tape
of her striped flannel drawers
before the range. Naked
on the pricked rag mat
his fingers comb
thatch of his manhood’s home. 
Gentle generous voices weave
over bare night
words to confirm and delight
till bird dawn.
Rainwater from the butt
she fetches and flannel
to wash him inch by inch,
kissing the pebbles.
Shining slowworm part of the marvel.
The mason stirs:
Words!
Pens are too light.
Take a chisel to write. 
Every birth a crime,
every sentence life.
Wiped of mould and mites
would the ball run true?
No hope of going back.
Hounds falter and stray,
shame deflects the pen.
Love murdered neither bleeds nor stifles
but jogs the draftsman’s elbow.
What can he, changed, tell
her, changed, perhaps dead?
Delight dwindles. Blame
stays the same. 
Brief words are hard to find,
shapes to carve and discard:
Bloodaxe, king of York,
king of Dublin, king of Orkney.
Take no notice of tears;
letter the stone to stand
over love laid aside lest
insufferable happiness impede
flight to Stainmore,
to trace
lark, mallet,
becks, flocks
and axe knocks. 
Dung will not soil the slowworm’s
mosaic. Breathless lark
drops to nest in sodden trash;
Rawthey truculent, dingy.
Drudge at the mallet, the may is down,
fog on fells. Guilty of spring
and spring’s ending
amputated years ache after
the bull is beef, love a convenience.
It is easier to die than to remember.
Name and date
split in soft slate
a few months obliterate.

Like words put to a song, the bunched tobacco leaves   
are strung along a stick, the women
standing in the August heat for hours—since first light—
under the pitched tin roof, barefoot, and at their feet   
the babies, bare-assed, dirty, eating dirt.
The older children hand the leaves from the slide,   
three leaves at a time, stalks upright, three handers
for each stringer, and three more heaped canvas slides   
waiting in what little shade there is: it’s ten o’clock,   
almost dinnertime. They pull the pails of cold lunch   
and Mason jars of tea out of the spring
when they see the farmer coming from the field, their men   
stripped to the waist, polished by sweat and tired as mules.   
By afternoon, the loose cotton dresses, even   
the headrags are dark with sweat.
Still their fingers never miss a stitch,
though they’re paid not by the stick but by the day,
and the talk—unbroken news of cousins and acquaintances—
unwinding with the ball of twine, a frayed snuff-twig   
bouncing on one lip, the string paying out
through their calluses, the piles of wide green leaves   
diminishing, until the men appear with the last slide   
and clamber up the rafters of the barn
to line the loaded sticks along the tiers. It’s Friday: 
the farmer pays with a wad of ones and fives,   
having turned the mule out to its feed and water,   
hung up the stiffened traces and the bit. He checks   
again the other barns, already fired, crude ovens   
of log and mud where the crop is cured;
in that hot dry acrid air, spreads a yellowing leaf   
across his palm, rolls an edge in his fingers,   
gauging by its texture and its smell
how high to drive the fire.
His crew is quiet in the pickup truck—did you think
they were singing? They are much too tired to even speak,   
can barely lick salt from the back of a hand, brush at flies,   
hush a baby with a sugartit. And the man
who owns this land is also tired.
Everyday this week he’s meant to bring home pears   
from the old tree by the barn, but now he sees
the fruit has fallen, sees the yellow jackets feeding there.   
He lights a Lucky, frames a joke for his wife—he’ll say   
their banker raised a piss-poor field this year.
And she will lean against the doorjamb
while he talks, while he scrubs his hands at the tin basin   
with a split lemon and a pumice stone, rubs them raw   
trying to cut the gummy resin, that stubborn
black stain within the green.

Small wonder
he’s not been sighted all winter;   
this old brock’s
been to Normandy and back 
through the tunnels and trenches   
of his subconscious.
His father fell victim
to mustard-gas at the Somme; 
one of his sons lost a paw   
to a gin-trap at Lisbellaw:
another drills
on the Antrim hills’ 
still-molten lava
in a moth-eaten Balaclava.
An elaborate
system of foxholes and duckboards 
leads to the terminal moraine   
of an ex-linen baron’s
croquet-lawn
where he’s part-time groundsman. 
I would find it somewhat infra dig 
to dismiss him simply as a pig   
or heed Gerald of Wales’
tall tales 
of badgers keeping badger-slaves.   
For when he shuffles
across the esker
I glimpse my grandfather’s whiskers 
stained with tobacco-pollen.
When he piddles against a bullaun   
I know he carries bovine TB
but what I see 
is my father in his Sunday suit’s   
bespoke lime and lignite,
patrolling his now-diminished estate   
and taking stock of this and that.

You did not come,And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb,—Yet less for loss of your dear presence thereThan that I thus found lacking in your makeThat high compassion which can overbearReluctance for pure lovingkindness’ sakeGrieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum,
     You did not come.
      You love not me,And love alone can lend you loyalty;–I know and knew it. But, unto the storeOf human deeds divine in all but name,Was it not worth a little hour or moreTo add yet this: Once you, a woman, cameTo soothe a time-torn man; even though it be
     You love not me?

I have met them in dark alleys, limping and one-armed;   
I have seen them playing cards under a single light-bulb   
and tried to join in, but they refused me rudely,   
knowing I would only let them win.   
I have seen them in the foyers of theaters,   
coming back late from the interval    
long after the others have taken their seats,   
and in deserted shopping malls late at night,   
peering at things they can never buy,   
and I have found them wandering   
in a wood where I too have wandered.    
This morning I caught one;   
small and stupid, too slow to get away,   
it was only a promise I had made to myself once   
and then forgot, but it screamed and kicked at me   
and ran to join the others, who looked at me with reproach   
in their long, sad faces.
When I drew near them, they scurried away,   
even though they will sleep in my yard tonight.   
I hate them for their ingratitude,   
I who have kept countless promises,   
as dead now as Shakespeare’s children.   
“You bastards,” I scream,   
“you have to love me—I gave you life!”

(THE MOB SPEAKS:) 
See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air   
Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he
Not more like brute than man? Look in his eye!   
No light is there; none, save the glint that shines   
In the now glaring, and now shifting orbs
Of some wild animal caught in the hunter’s trap. 
How came this beast in human shape and form?   
Speak man!—We call you man because you wear   
His shape—How are you thus? Are you not from   
That docile, child-like, tender-hearted race   
Which we have known three centuries? Not from   
That more than faithful race which through three wars   
Fed our dear wives and nursed our helpless babes   
Without a single breach of trust? Speak out!   (THE VICTIM SPEAKS:) 
I am, and am not.   (THE MOB SPEAKS AGAIN:) 
                            Then who, why are you?   (THE VICTIM SPEAKS AGAIN:) 
I am a thing not new, I am as old
As human nature. I am that which lurks,   
Ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed;   
The ancient trait which fights incessantly   
Against restraint, balks at the upward climb;   
The weight forever seeking to obey   
The law of downward pull—and I am more:   
The bitter fruit am I of planted seed;   
The resultant, the inevitable end
Of evil forces and the powers of wrong.
Lessons in degradation, taught and learned,   
The memories of cruel sights and deeds,   
The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate   
Filtered through fifteen generations have   
Sprung up and found in me sporadic life.   
In me the muttered curse of dying men,   
On me the stain of conquered women, and   
Consuming me the fearful fires of lust,   
Lit long ago, by other hands than mine.
In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers   
Of wretches now long dead—their dire bequests.   
In me the echo of the stifled cry
Of children for their battered mothers’ breasts. 
I claim no race, no race claims me; I am   
No more than human dregs; degenerate;
The monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin;   
I am—just what I am. . . . The race that fed
Your wives and nursed your babes would do the same   
Today. But I—   (THE MOB CONCLUDES:) 
                      Enough, the brute must die!   
Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist   
The fire much longer than this slender pine.   
Now bring the fuel! Pile it round him! Wait!   
Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose   
The agony and terror in his face.
And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames   
Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek!   
And there’s another! wilder than the first.   
Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on
The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so!   
Now let it slowly blaze again. See there!
He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out,   
Searching around in vain appeal for help!   
Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh   
Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts
Down through the coils of chain that hold erect   
The ghastly frame against the bark-scorched tree. 
Stop! to each man no more than one man’s share.   
You take that bone, and you this tooth; the chain,   
Let us divide its links; this skull, of course,   
In fair division, to the leader comes. 
And now his fiendish crime has been avenged;   
Let us back to our wives and children—say,   
What did he mean by those last muttered words,    “Brothers in spirit, brothers in deed are we”?

So I would hear out those lungs,   
The air split into nine levels,
Some gift of tongues of the whistler 
In the invalid’s bed: my mother,   
Warbling all day to herself
The thousand variations of one song; 
It is called Buckdancer’s Choice.   
For years, they have all been dying   
Out, the classic buck-and-wing men 
Of traveling minstrel shows;   
With them also an old woman   
Was dying of breathless angina, 
Yet still found breath enough   
To whistle up in my head   
A sight like a one-man band, 
Freed black, with cymbals at heel,   
An ex-slave who thrivingly danced   
To the ring of his own clashing light 
Through the thousand variations of one song   
All day to my mother’s prone music,   
The invalid’s warbler’s note, 
While I crept close to the wall   
Sock-footed, to hear the sounds alter,   
Her tongue like a mockingbird’s break 
Through stratum after stratum of a tone   
Proclaiming what choices there are   
For the last dancers of their kind, 
For ill women and for all slaves
Of death, and children enchanted at walls   
With a brass-beating glow underfoot, 
Not dancing but nearly risen   
Through barnlike, theatrelike houses   
On the wings of the buck and wing.

Impatient as we were for all of them to join us,
The land had not yet risen into view: gulls had swept the gray steel towers away
So that it profited less to go searching, away over the humming earth
Than to stay in immediate relation to these other things—boxes, store parts, whatever you wanted to call them—
Whose installedness was the price of further revolutions, so you knew this combat was the last.
And still the relationship waxed, billowed like scenery on the breeze. 
They are the same aren’t they,
The presumed landscape and the dream of home
Because the people are all homesick today or desperately sleeping,   
Trying to remember how those rectangular shapes
Became so extraneous and so near
To create a foreground of quiet knowledge
In which youth had grown old, chanting and singing wise hymns that   
Will sign for old age
And so lift up the past to be persuaded, and be put down again. 
The warning is nothing more than an aspirate “h”;
The problem is sketched completely, like fireworks mounted on poles:   
Complexion of evening, the accurate voices of the others.
During Coca-Cola lessons it becomes patent
Of noise on the left, and we had so skipped a stage that   
The great wave of the past, compounded in derision,   
Submerged idea and non-dreamer alike   
In falsetto starlight like “purity”
Of design that had been the first danger sign
To wash the sticky, icky stuff down the drain—pfui! 
How does it feel to be outside and inside at the same time,
The delicious feeling of the air contradicting and secretly abetting
The interior warmth? But the land curdles the dismay in which it’s written   
Bearing to a final point of folly and doom
The wisdom of these generations.
Look at what you’ve done to the landscape—
The ice cube, the olive—
There is a perfect tri-city mesh of things
Extending all the way along the river on both sides
With the end left for thoughts on construction
That are always turning to alps and thresholds
Above the tide of others, feeding a European moss rose without glory. 
We shall very soon have the pleasure of recording
A period of unanimous tergiversation in this respect
And to make that pleasure the greater, it is worth while
At the risk of tedious iteration, to put first upon record a final protest:   
Rather decaying art, genius, inspiration to hold to
An impossible “calque” of reality, than
“The new school of the trivial, rising up on the field of battle,   
Something of sludge and leaf-mold,” and life
Goes trickling out through the holes, like water through a sieve,   
All in one direction. 
You who were directionless, and thought it would solve everything if you found one,
What do you make of this? Just because a thing is immortal
Is that any reason to worship it? Death, after all, is immortal.   
But you have gone into your houses and shut the doors, meaning   
There can be no further discussion.
And the river pursues its lonely course
With the sky and the trees cast up from the landscape
For green brings unhappiness—le vert Porte malheur.
“The chartreuse mountain on the absinthe plain
Makes the strong man’s tears tumble down like rain.” 
All this came to pass eons ago.
Your program worked out perfectly. You even avoided
The monotony of perfection by leaving in certain flaws:
A backward way of becoming, a forced handshake,
An absent-minded smile, though in fact nothing was left to chance.
Each detail was startlingly clear, as though seen through a magnifying glass,   
Or would have been to an ideal observer, namely yourself—
For only you could watch yourself so patiently from afar
The way God watches a sinner on the path to redemption,
Sometimes disappearing into valleys, but always on the way,
For it all builds up into something, meaningless or meaningful
As architecture, because planned and then abandoned when completed,   
To live afterwards, in sunlight and shadow, a certain amount of years.   
Who cares about what was there before? There is no going back,   
For standing still means death, and life is moving on,
Moving on towards death. But sometimes standing still is also life.

Aunt Mildred tied up her petticoats with binder’s
twine, and my great-uncle Ezekiel waxed and waxed
his moustaches into flexibility. It was the whole
family off then into the dangerous continent of air 
and while the salesman with the one gold eyetooth told us
the cords at our ankles were guaranteed to stretch
to their utmost and then bring us safely back
to the fried chicken and scalloped potatoes of Sunday dinner 
nobody quite believed. Edwina, my father’s half sister
by my grandfather’s marriage to a former dance hall girl,
who got her doctorate in tensor evaluation, she said
whole galaxies have been known to belch and disappear 
taking with them the King Charles spaniels and the gold-
plated fire hydrants from where the fire finally stopped
in the earthquake year. But it was no good growing
roots into the vegetable garden, not after the Monarch 
butterflies flew up into one whirling vortex and blanked
out of immediate space, it was no good
hoping Ken and Barbie, sexless, would anchor us
to our interchangeable faces, or that our feet 
those flat independent anemones, could grip forever.
The salesman smiled, with his face the size
of the Empire State and growing bigger and bigger
and into and through the face Aunt Mildred went 
shouting “Banzai!” into Great-Uncle Ezekiel’s
inherited ear trumpet, shredding it to tin ribbons,
and Edwina, dressed in the full commencement robes
of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and 
Mother and Father wrapped in each other’s
reminiscences, and the goldfish, and finally I went
too, out of the mold my body had been formed in
and inhabited, as if place were the only realization of person 
and either the cords snapped, as any sceptic might have expected,
or they are stretched out finer than a human hair,
that keeps growing after death, even in the black melting
that may or may not be the tight coral beach beyond.

On the Gilfillan burial day, In the Hill o’ Balgay, It was a most solemn sight to see, Not fewer than thirty thousand people assembled in Dundee, All watching the funeral procession of Gilfillan that day, That death had suddenly taken away, And was going to be buried in the Hill o’ Balgay.  There were about three thousand people in the procession alone, And many were shedding tears, and several did moan, And their bosoms heaved with pain, Because they knew they would never look upon his like again.  There could not be fewer than fifty carriages in the procession that day, And gentlemen in some of them that had come from far away, And in whispers some of them did say, As the hearse bore the precious corpse away, Along the Nethergate that day.  I’m sure he will be greatly missed by the poor, For he never turned them empty-handed away from his door; And to assist them in distress it didn’t give him pain, And I’m sure the poor will never look upon his like again.  On the Gilfillan burial day, in the Hill o’ Balgay, There was a body of policemen marshalled in grand array, And marched in front of the procession all the way; Also the relatives and friends of the deceas’d, Whom I hope from all sorrows has been releas’d, And whose soul I hope to heaven has fled away, To sing with saints above for ever and aye.  The Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council were in the procession that day; Also Mrs Gilfillan, who cried and sobbed all the way For her kind husband, that was always affable and gay, Which she will remember until her dying day.  When the procession arrived in the Hill o’ Balgay, The people were almost as hush as death, and many of them did say— As long as we live we’ll remember the day That the great Gilfillan was buried in the Hill o’Balgay.  When the body of the great Gilfillan was lowered into the grave, ’Twas then the people’s hearts with sorrow did heave; And with tearful eyes and bated breath, Mrs Gilfillan lamented her loving husband’s death.  Then she dropped a ringlet of immortelles into his grave, Then took one last fond look, and in sorrow did leave; And all the people left with sad hearts that day, And that ended the Gilfillan burial in the Hill o’ Balgay.

There is a hornet in the room   
and one of us will have to go   
out the window into the late   
August midafternoon sun. I
won. There is a certain challenge   
in being humane to hornets   
but not much. A launch draws   
two lines of wake behind it   
on the bay like a delta
with a melted base. Sandy   
billows, or so they look,
of feathery ripe heads of grass,   
an acid-yellow kind of
goldenrod glowing or glowering   
in shade. Rocks with rags   
of shadow, washed dust clouts   
that will never bleach.
It is not like this at all.   
The rapid running of the   
lapping water a hollow knock
of someone shipping oars:   
it’s eleven years since   
Frank sat at this desk and   
saw and heard it all   
the incessant water the   
immutable crickets only   
not the same: new needles   
on the spruce, new seaweed   
on the low-tide rocks   
other grass and other water   
even the great gold lichen   
on a granite boulder   
even the boulder quite   
literally is not the same 
      II
A day subtle and suppressed   
in mounds of juniper enfolding   
scratchy pockets of shadow
while bigness—rocks, trees, a stump—
stands shadowless in an overcast   
of ripe grass. There is nothing   
but shade, like the boggy depths   
of a stand of spruce, its resonance   
just the thin scream
of mosquitoes ascending.
Boats are light lumps on the bay   
stretching past erased islands   
to ocean and the terrible tumble   
and London (“rain persisting”)   
and Paris (“changing to rain”).   
Delicate day, setting the bright
of a young spruce against the cold
of an old one hung with unripe cones   
each exuding at its tip
gum, pungent, clear as a tear,   
a day tarnished and fractured   
as the quartz in the rocks
of a dulled and distant point,   
a day like a gull passing
with a slow flapping of wings   
in a kind of lope, without
breeze enough to shake loose   
the last of the fireweed flowers,
a faintly clammy day, like wet silk   
stained by one dead branch   
the harsh russet of dried blood.

As I in hoary winter’s night stood shivering in the snow, Surpris’d I was with sudden heat which made my heart to glow; And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near, A pretty Babe all burning bright did in the air appear; Who, scorched with excessive heat, such floods of tears did shed As though his floods should quench his flames which with his tears were fed. “Alas!” quoth he, “but newly born, in fiery heats I fry, Yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel my fire but I! My faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel wounding thorns, Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke, the ashes shame and scorns; The fuel Justice layeth on, and Mercy blows the coals, The metal in this furnace wrought are men’s defiled souls, For which, as now on fire I am to work them to their good,       So will I melt into a bath to wash them in my blood.”       With this he vanish’d out of sight and swiftly shrunk away,       And straight I called unto mind that it was Christmas day.

Before my drift-wood fire I sit,    And see, with every waif I burn, Old dreams and fancies coloring it,    And folly’s unlaid ghosts return.  O ships of mine, whose swift keels cleft    The enchanted sea on which they sailed, Are these poor fragments only left    Of vain desires and hopes that failed?  Did I not watch from them the light    Of sunset on my towers in Spain, And see, far off, uploom in sight    The Fortunate Isles I might not gain?  Did sudden lift of fog reveal    Arcadia’s vales of song and spring, And did I pass, with grazing keel,    The rocks whereon the sirens sing?  Have I not drifted hard upon    The unmapped regions lost to man, The cloud-pitched tents of Prester John,    The palace domes of Kubla Khan?  Did land winds blow from jasmine flowers,    Where Youth the ageless Fountain fills? Did Love make sign from rose blown bowers,    And gold from Eldorado’s hills?  Alas! the gallant ships, that sailed    On blind Adventure’s errand sent, Howe’er they laid their courses, failed    To reach the haven of Content.  And of my ventures, those alone    Which Love had freighted, safely sped, Seeking a good beyond my own,    By clear-eyed Duty piloted.  O mariners, hoping still to meet    The luck Arabian voyagers met, And find in Bagdad’s moonlit street,    Haroun al Raschid walking yet,  Take with you, on your Sea of Dreams,    The fair, fond fancies dear to youth. I turn from all that only seems,    And seek the sober grounds of truth.  What matter that it is not May,    That birds have flown, and trees are bare, That darker grows the shortening day,    And colder blows the wintry air!  The wrecks of passion and desire,    The castles I no more rebuild, May fitly feed my drift-wood fire,    And warm the hands that age has chilled.  Whatever perished with my ships,    I only know the best remains; A song of praise is on my lips    For losses which are now my gains.  Heap high my hearth! No worth is lost;    No wisdom with the folly dies. Burn on, poor shreds, your holocaust    Shall be my evening sacrifice!  Far more than all I dared to dream,    Unsought before my door I see; On wings of fire and steeds of steam    The world’s great wonders come to me,  And holier signs, unmarked before,    Of Love to seek and Power to save,— The righting of the wronged and poor,    The man evolving from the slave;  And life, no longer chance or fate,    Safe in the gracious Fatherhood. I fold o’er-wearied hands and wait,    In full assurance of the good.  And well the waiting time must be,    Though brief or long its granted days, If Faith and Hope and Charity    Sit by my evening hearth-fire’s blaze.  And with them, friends whom Heaven has spared,    Whose love my heart has comforted, And, sharing all my joys, has shared    My tender memories of the dead,—  Dear souls who left us lonely here,    Bound on their last, long voyage, to whom We, day by day, are drawing near,    Where every bark has sailing room.  I know the solemn monotone    Of waters calling unto me; I know from whence the airs have blown    That whisper of the Eternal Sea.  As low my fires of drift-wood burn,    I hear that sea’s deep sounds increase, And, fair in sunset light, discern    Its mirage-lifted Isles of Peace.

Letters swallow themselves in seconds.   
Notes friends tied to the doorknob,   
transparent scarlet paper,
sizzle like moth wings,
marry the air. 
So much of any year is flammable,   
lists of vegetables, partial poems.   
Orange swirling flame of days,   
so little is a stone. 
Where there was something and suddenly isn’t,   
an absence shouts, celebrates, leaves a space.   
I begin again with the smallest numbers. 
Quick dance, shuffle of losses and leaves,   
only the things I didn’t do   
crackle after the blazing dies.

Stiff, thick: the white hair of the broad-faced father,
who leads his shambling son along
cracked sidewalks, by dusty glass half hiding
goods never sold. The son is the taller one
but still a child: not aware of his clothes,
of what expressions seize on his soft face.
His gait lolls, loosely directed from some weak,
distant center, scarcely devoted to any purpose
but following along and looking. Thick lenses glint
with watery blue: his small eyes, veiled
and placid, as far off as the milky August sky.
The father, all the time glancing at him and talking
as man to man, seems to forget it would be better
for this one to have been like all the rest.
He has his son still with him, the others
have grown up and gone away—but when he dies,
then what will happen to the boy? Even this thought
is absorbed now in their ordinary errand,
men’s business: grateful going out through the day,
talk with the owners, the salesmen, a mechanic
in the scent of grease and sawdust of machined metal,
the sifting through tools and parts that flow, spill, gleam
like seeds, like sand—looking for what fits,
finding what will work. Afterwards to stop for food,
then walk back home down the clear streets, when starlings,
hunting and restless before sleep, and children
are the loudest things, with the dark foaming
among maples, glinting, as it comes in.

Little Poems in Prose



I. The Exodus. (August 3, 1492.)  1. The Spanish noon is a blaze of azure fire, and the dusty pilgrims crawl like an endless serpent along treeless plains and bleached highroads, through rock-split ravines and castellated, cathedral-shadowed towns.
2. The hoary patriarch, wrinkled as an almond shell, bows painfully upon his staff. The beautiful young mother, ivory-pale, well-nigh swoons beneath her burden; in her large enfolding arms nestles her sleeping babe, round her knees flock her little ones with bruised and bleeding feet. “Mother, shall we soon be there?”
3. The youth with Christ-like countenance speaks comfortably to father and brother, to maiden and wife. In his breast, his own heart is broken.
4. The halt, the blind, are amid the train. Sturdy pack-horses laboriously drag the tented wagons wherein lie the sick athirst with fever.
5. The panting mules are urged forward with spur and goad; stuffed are the heavy saddlebags with the wreckage of ruined homes.
6. Hark to the tinkling silver bells that adorn the tenderly-carried silken scrolls.
7. In the fierce noon-glare a lad bears a kindled lamp; behind its network of bronze the airs of heaven breathe not upon its faint purple star.
8. Noble and abject, learned and simple, illustrious and obscure, plod side by side, all brothers now, all merged in one routed army of misfortune.
9. Woe to the straggler who falls by the wayside! no friend shall close his eyes.
10. They leave behind, the grape, the olive, and the fig; the vines they planted, the corn they sowed, the garden-cities of Andalusia and Aragon, Estremadura and La Mancha, of Granada and Castile; the altar, the hearth, and the grave of their fathers.
11. The townsman spits at their garments, the shepherd quits his flock, the peasant his plow, to pelt with curses and stones; the villager sets on their trail his yelping cur.
12. Oh the weary march, oh the uptorn roots of home, oh the blankness of the receding goal!
13. Listen to their lamentation: They that ate dainty food are desolate in the streets; they that were reared in scarlet embrace dunghills. They flee away and wander about. Men say among the nations, they shall no more sojourn there; our end is near, our days are full, our doom is come.  14. Whither shall they turn? for the West hath cast them out, and the East refuseth to receive.
15. O bird of the air, whisper to the despairing exiles, that to-day, to-day, from the many-masted, gayly-bannered port of Palos, sails the world-unveiling Genoese, to unlock the golden gates of sunset and bequeath a Continent to Freedom!
 II. Treasures.  1. Through cycles of darkness the diamond sleeps in its coal-black prison.
2. Purely incrusted in its scaly casket, the breath-tarnished pearl slumbers in mud and ooze.
3. Buried in the bowels of earth, rugged and obscure, lies the ingot of gold.
4. Long hast thou been buried, O Israel, in the bowels of earth; long hast thou slumbered beneath the overwhelming waves; long hast thou slept in the rayless house of darkness.
5. Rejoice and sing, for only thus couldst thou rightly guard the golden knowledge, Truth, the delicate pearl and the adamantine jewel of the Law.
 III. The Sower.  1. Over a boundless plain went a man, carrying seed.
2. His face was blackened by sun and rugged from tempest, scarred and distorted by pain. Naked to the loins, his back was ridged with furrows, his breast was plowed with stripes.
3. From his hand dropped the fecund seed.
4. And behold, instantly started from the prepared soil blade, a sheaf, a springing trunk, a myriad-branching, cloud-aspiring tree. Its arms touched the ends of the horizon, the heavens were darkened with its shadow.
5. It bare blossoms of gold and blossoms of blood, fruitage of health and fruitage of poison; birds sang amid its foliage, and a serpent was coiled about its stem.
6. Under its branches a divinely beautiful man, crowned with thorns, was nailed to a cross.
7. And the tree put forth treacherous boughs to strangle the Sower; his flesh was bruised and torn, but cunningly he disentangled the murderous knot and passed to the eastward.
8. Again there dropped from his hand the fecund seed.
9. And behold, instantly started from the prepared soil a blade, a sheaf, a springing trunk, a myriad-branching, cloud-aspiring tree. Crescent shaped like little emerald moons were the leaves; it bare blossoms of silver and blossoms of blood, fruitage of health and fruitage of poison; birds sang amid its foilage and a serpent was coiled about its stem.
10. Under its branches a turbaned mighty-limbed Prophet brandished a drawn sword.
11. And behold, this tree likewise puts forth perfidious arms to strangle the Sower; but cunningly he disentangles the murderous knot and passes on.
12. Lo, his hands are not empty of grain, the strength of his arm is not spent.
13. What germ hast thou saved for the future, O miraculous Husbandman? Tell me, thou Planter of Christhood and Islam; tell me, thou seed-bearing Israel!
 IV. The Test.  1. Daylong I brooded upon the Passion of Israel.
2. I saw him bound to the wheel, nailed to the cross, cut off by the sword, burned at the stake, tossed into the seas.
3. And always the patient, resolute, martyr face arose in silent rebuke and defiance.
4. A Prophet with four eyes; wide gazed the orbs of the spirit above the sleeping eyelids of the senses.
5. A Poet, who plucked from his bosom the quivering heart and fashioned it into a lyre.
6. A placid-browed Sage, uplifted from earth in celestial meditation.
7. These I saw, with princes and people in their train; the monumental dead and the standard-bearers of the future.
8. And suddenly I heard a burst of mocking laughter, and turning, I beheld the shuffling gait, the ignominious features, the sordid mask of the son of the Ghetto.
 V. Currents.  1. Vast oceanic movements, the flux and reflux of immeasurable tides, oversweep our continent.
2. From the far Caucasian steppes, from the squalid Ghettos of Europe,
3. From Odessa and Bucharest, from Kief and Ekaterinoslav,
4. Hark to the cry of the exiles of Babylon, the voice of Rachel mourning for her children, of Israel lamenting for Zion.
5. And lo, like a turbid stream, the long-pent flood bursts the dykes of oppression and rushes hitherward.
6. Unto her ample breast, the generous mother of nations welcomes them.
7. The herdsman of Canaan and the seed of Jerusalem’s royal shepherds renew their youth amid the pastoral plains of Texas and the golden valleys of the Sierras.
 VI. The Prophet.  1. Moses ben Maimon lifting his perpetual lamp over the path of the perplexed;
2. Hallevi, the honey-tongued poet, wakening amid the silent ruins of Zion the sleeping lyre of David;
3. Moses, the wise son of Mendel, who made the Ghetto illustrious;
4. Abarbanel, the counselor of kings; Aicharisi, the exquisite singer; Ibn Ezra, the perfect old man; Gabirol, the tragic seer;
5. Heine, the enchanted magician, the heart-broken jester;
6.Yea, and the century-crowned patriarch whose bounty engirdles the globe;—
7. These need no wreath and no trumpet; like perennial asphodel blossoms, their fame, their glory resounds like the brazen-throated cornet.
8. But thou—hast thou faith in the fortune of Israel? Wouldst thou lighten the anguish of Jacob?
9. Then shalt thou take the hand of yonder caftaned wretch with flowing curls and gold-pierced ears;
10. Who crawls blinking forth from the loathsome recesses of the Jewry;
11. Nerveless his fingers, puny his frame; haunted by the bat-like phantoms of superstition is his brain.
12. Thou shalt say to the bigot, “My Brother,” and to the creature of darkness, “My Friend.”
13 . And thy heart shall spend itself in fountains of love upon the ignorant, the coarse, and the abject.
14. Then in the obscurity thou shalt hear a rush of wings, thine eyes shall be bitten with pungent smoke.
15. And close against thy quivering lips shall be pressed the live coal wherewith the Seraphim brand the Prophets.
 VII. Chrysalis.  1. Long, long has the Orient Jew spun around his helplessness the cunningly enmeshed web of Talmud and Kabbala.
2. Imprisoned in dark corners of misery and oppression, closely he drew about him the dust-gray filaments, soft as silk and stubborn as steel, until he lay death-stiffened in mummied seclusion.
3. And the world has named him an ugly worm, shunning the blessed daylight.
4. But when the emancipating springtide breathes wholesome, quickening airs, when the Sun of Love shines out with cordial fires, lo, the Soul of Israel bursts her cobweb sheath, and flies forth attired in the winged beauty of immortality.

That’s right, said the cab driver,
Turning the corner to the
Round-a-bout way,
Those stupid, fuckin’ beggars,
You know the guys who
Walk up to my cab
With their hands extended
And their little cups?
You know their problem?
You know what’s wrong with them?
They ain’t got no brains.
I mean, they don’t know nothin’
’cause if they had brains
They’d think of a way
To find a job.
You know what one of ’em told me once?
He said what he did,
Begging
He said it was work.
Begging
Was work.
And I told him
Straight to his face:
That ain’t work. You think that’s work?
Let me tell you what work is:
Work is something that you do
That’s of value
To someone else.
Now you take me.
It takes brains to do
What I do.
You know what I think?
I think they ought to send
All these beggars over
To some other country,
Any country,
It don’t matter which,
For 3, 4, years,
Let them wander around
Some other country,
See how they like that.
We ought to make a
National program
Sending them off
To wander about
Some other country
For a few years,
Let ’em beg over there,
See how far it gets them.
I mean, look at that guy
You know, who was big
In the sixties,
That drug guy,
Timothy Leary?
Yeah, he went underground,
Lived overseas.
You know what?
A few years abroad
And he was ready to
Come back
On any terms.
He didn’t care if
They arrested him.
He said
The U.S. is better
Than any country
In the world.
Send them over there
For a few years.
They’d be just like him.
This is the greatest country
In the whole world.
Timothy Leary
Was damn happy
To get back here,
And he’s doing fine.
Look at me.
I used to be like that.
I used to live underground.
I came back.
I think all those beggars got
   a mental block.
I think you should do something.
I mean, you ought to like
   what you do,
But you should do something.
Something of use
To the community.
All those people,
Those bums,
Those scam artists,
Those hustlers,
Those drug addicts,
Those welfare cheats,
Those sponges.
Other than that
I don’t hold nothin’
Against no one.
Hey, I picked you up.

The past
will overtake   
alien force   
our house   
formed
of my mind   
to enter
explorer
in a forest   
of myself
for all
my learning   
Solitude
quiet
and quieter   
fringe
of trees
by a river
bridges black   
on the deep   
the heaving sea   
a watcher stands
to see her ship   
winging away   
Thick noises
merge in moonlight   
dark ripples   
dissolving
and
defining
spheres
and
snares 
             Place of importance as in the old days
stood on the ramparts of the fort
                                                 the open sea outside   
alone with water-birds and cattle
                        knee-deep in a stream
grove of reeds
               herons watching from the bank
henges
      whole fields honeycombed with souterrains   
human
                        bones through the gloom
       whose sudden mouth
surrounded my face
                      a thread of blue around the coast   
                                                         feathery moon   
eternity swallows up time
                                     peaceable as foam
                        O cabbage gardens
summer’s elegy
                        sunset survived


^^EOP^^

eviction people arrive to haunt me
      with descriptions of summer’s wildflowers
            how they are carpet of fierce colors 
I bet you hate to see us they say and yes
      I do hate to have to move again especially from here
            destruction brought to place of love 
the uneven smiles that win she’s a business woman
      blond tints that glow at sunset as profits rise
            alas what labor I employ 
but to ensure a moment’s joy
      sets branches trembling & arms chilled
            dear one long returning home, come to 
clammy feverish details, muffed sorrow
      I turn to throw a tear of rage in the pot
            never remorse but hint of scruples I’d hope for 
it is error it is speculation it is real estate
      it is the villain and comic slippery words
            the work of despotic wills to make money 
I scream take it take your money! make your money
      go on it’s only money, here’s a wall of dry rot
            here’s an unfinished ceiling, just a little sunlight 
peeks through this (lark, no luminance! exquisite St. Etienne
      stove doesn’t work icebox either too hot or frozen
            firescreen tumbling down 
kitchen insulation droops is ugly & a mess
      ah but love it here, only surface appearances
            to complain of, nothing does justice 
to shape of actual events I love
      but a fight against artificiality
            its inherent antagonism, bald hatred of moving 
and problem of thirsty fig tree in Burroughs
      apartment wakes me I don’t want to go down there yet
            & how to orchestrate the summer properly 
the problem of distress & not denying pride from it
      too atomized to make pleasure of melancholy
            & an uncontrollable enthusiasm for throne & altar 
I want to sit high want simple phalanx
      of power independent of everything but free will
            & one long hymn in praise of the cabin! 
it is a confession in me impenetrably walled in
      like aesthetics like cosmos an organ of
            metaphysics and O this book gives me a headache 
dear Weston La Barre let’s have an argument
      because I see too clearly how rational I must be &
            the kernel of my faith corrupted 
because you have no reliance on the shaman & outlaw
      or how depth of mind might be staggering
            everywhere except in how important science is 
science? no he won’t he fooled by visions
      whereas I wait for dazzling UFOs they announce
            will arrive high in these mountains 
I repair the portal even invite stray horses in
      have a little toy receiving station
            that sits by the bed 
at the edge of night all thoughts to place of love
      all worries to this place of love
            all gestures to the place of love 
all agonies to place of love, thaws to place
      of love, swarthy valley sealed
            in wood, log burst into flame 
in home of love, all heart’s dints
      and machinations, all bellows & pungency
            antemundane thoughts to palace of love 
all liberties, singularity, all imaginings
      I weep for, Jack’s sweet almond-eyed daughter to
            place of love, & heavy blankets 
and terracing & yard work & patch work
      & tenacity & the best in you
            surround me work in me to place my love 
dear cirques, clear constraint, dissenting
      inclinations of a man and a woman, Metonic cycle
            all that sweats in rooms, lives in nature 
requiems & momentum & trimmings of bushes
      dried hibiscus & hawks & shyness
            brought to this place of love 
trees rooted fear rooted all roots brought
      to place of love, mystery to heart of love
            & fibers 
and fibers in sphere of love a whole world makes
      spectators of slow flowering of spring
            & summer when you walk to town for eggs 
and continuous hammerings as new people
      arrive & today we notice for first time
            a white-crowned sparrow out by the feeder 
with the chickadees & juncos & I missed
      that airplane-dinosaur in dream nervous
            to travel again, miss buds pop open 
to shudder in breeze, their tractability
      makes sudden rise of sensibility you are
            shuddering too & your boy laugh 
comes less frequent now you’re drawn into
      accountability, will I return to find all
            stuff tidy in silver truck 
ready to go? it’s you in this place I lose
      most because it’s here in you I forget
            where I am, this place for supernaturals 
perched high in sky & wind, held by wind in stationary
      motion as bluebird we observe over meadow or caught
            up with jetstream dipping in valley’s soft cradle 
power & light & heat & radiance of head it takes
      power & light & heat & radiance of head it takes to
            make it work while 
down there someone building replicas of what
      it feels like to be a human multitude, fantasy
            molded clumsily, spare my loves 
and love of glorious architecture when you really put
      outside in, the feeling of cloud or mountain
            or stone 
having developed an idea of idyllic private life
      & sovereignty of spirit over common
            empirical demand 
I tell you about renunciation, I tell you holy
      isolation like a river nears ocean to
            dissolve 
and cabin becomes someone’s idea of a good place
      discretion you pay for it wasn’t mine either
            but sits on me imprints on me 
forever splendor of fog, snow shut strangers out
      gradual turn of season, ground stir, pine
            needle tickle your shoulder, peak curve, fresh air.

If all the trees in all the woods were men; And each and every blade of grass a pen; If every leaf on every shrub and tree Turned to a sheet of foolscap; every sea Were changed to ink, and all earth's living tribes Had nothing else to do but act as scribes, And for ten thousand ages, day and night, The human race should write, and write, and write, Till all the pens and paper were used up, And the huge inkstand was an empty cup, Still would the scribblers clustered round its brink Call for more pens, more paper, and more ink.

Crashing
again—Basquiat
sends fenders 
& letters headlong
into each other
the future. Fusion. 
AAAAAAAAAAA. 
Big Bang. The Big
Apple, Atom's
behind him— 
no sirens
in sight. His career
of careening 
since—at six—
playing stickball
a car stole 
his spleen. Blind
sided. Move
along folks—nothing 
to see here. Driven,
does two Caddys
colliding, biting 
the dust he's begun
to snort. Hit
& run. Red 
Cross—the pill-pale
ambulance, inside
out, he hitched 
to the hospital.
Joy ride. Hot
wired. O the rush 
before the wreck— 
each Cadillac,
a Titanic,
an iceberg that's met 
its match—cabin
flooded
like an engine, 
drawing even
dark Shine
from below deck. 
FLATS FIX. Chop 
shop. Body work
while-u-wait. In situ
the spleen

I, with whose colours Myra dress’d her head,     I, that ware posies of her own hand-making, I, that mine own name in the chimneys read     By Myra finely wrought ere I was waking:          Must I look on, in hope time coming may          With change bring back my turn again to play?  I, that on Sunday at the church-stile found     A garland sweet, with true-love knots in flowers, Which I to wear about mine arm was bound,     That each of us might know that all was ours:          Must I now lead an idle life in wishes,          And follow Cupid for his loaves and fishes?  I, that did wear the ring her mother left,     I, for whose love she gloried to be blamed, I, with whose eyes her eyes committed theft,     I, who did make her blush when I was named:          Must I lose ring, flowers, blush, theft, and go naked,          Watching with sighs till dead love be awaked?  I, that, when drowsy Argus fell asleep,     Like jealousy o’erwatched with desire, Was even warned modesty to keep,     While her breath, speaking, kindled Nature’s fire:          Must I look on a-cold, while others warm them?          Do Vulcan’s brothers in such fine nets arm them?  Was it for this that I might Myra see     Washing the water with her beauties white? Yet would she never write her love to me.     Thinks wit of change, while thoughts are in delight?          Mad girls must safely love as they may leave;          No man can print a kiss: lines may deceive.

The nurse-life wheat within his green husk growing, Flatters our hope, and tickles our desire, Nature’s true riches in sweet beauties showing, Which sets all hearts, with labor’s love, on fire.  No less fair is the wheat when golden ear Shows unto hope the joys of near enjoying; Fair and sweet is the bud, more sweet and fair the rose, which proves that time is not destroying.  Caelica, your youth, the morning of delight, Enamel’d o’er with beauties white and red, All sense and thoughts did to belief invite, That love and glory there are brought to bed;       And your ripe year’s love-noon; he goes no higher,       Turns all the spirits of man into desire.

You little stars that live in skies And glory in Apollo’s glory, In whose aspècts conjoinèd lies The heaven’s will and nature’s story, Joy to be likened to those eyes, Which eyes make all eyes glad or sorry;    For when you force thoughts from above,    These overrule your force by love.  And thou, O Love, which in these eyes Hast married Reason with Affection, And made them saints of Beauty’s skies, Where joys are shadows of perfection, Lend me thy wings that I may rise Up, not by worth, but thy election;    For I have vowed in strangest fashion    To love and never seek compassion.

A free bird leaps
on the back of the wind   
and floats downstream   
till the current ends
and dips his wing
in the orange sun rays
and dares to claim the sky. 
But a bird that stalks
down his narrow cage
can seldom see through
his bars of rage
his wings are clipped and   
his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing. 
The caged bird sings   
with a fearful trill   
of things unknown   
but longed for still   
and his tune is heard   
on the distant hill   
for the caged bird   
sings of freedom. 
The free bird thinks of another breeze
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn
and he names the sky his own 
But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams   
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   
so he opens his throat to sing. 
The caged bird sings   
with a fearful trill   
of things unknown   
but longed for still   
and his tune is heard   
on the distant hill   
for the caged bird   
sings of freedom.

FOR DAVID P—B



The eye follows, the land
Slips upward, creases down, forms   
The gentle buttocks of a young   
Giant. In the nestle,
Old adobe bricks, washed of   
Whiteness, paled to umber,
Await another century. 
Star Jasmine and old vines
Lay claim upon the ghosted land,   
Then quiet pools whisper   
Private childhood secrets. 
Flush on inner cottage walls   
Antiquitous faces,
Used to the gelid breath
Of old manors, glare disdainfully   
Over breached time. 
Around and through these   
Cold phantasmatalities,   
He walks, insisting
To the languid air,
Activity, music,
A generosity of graces. 
His lupin fields spurn old
Deceit and agile poppies dance
In golden riot.   Each day is
Fulminant, exploding brightly   
Under the gaze of his exquisite   
Sires, frozen in the famed paint   
Of dead masters. Audacious   
Sunlight casts defiance
At their feet.

Calmly we walk through this April’s day,   
Metropolitan poetry here and there,   
In the park sit pauper and rentier,   
The screaming children, the motor-car   
Fugitive about us, running away,   
Between the worker and the millionaire   
Number provides all distances,   
It is Nineteen Thirty-Seven now,   
Many great dears are taken away,   
What will become of you and me
(This is the school in which we learn ...)   
Besides the photo and the memory?
(... that time is the fire in which we burn.) 
(This is the school in which we learn ...)   
What is the self amid this blaze?
What am I now that I was then
Which I shall suffer and act again,
The theodicy I wrote in my high school days   
Restored all life from infancy,
The children shouting are bright as they run   
(This is the school in which they learn ...)   
Ravished entirely in their passing play!
(... that time is the fire in which they burn.) 
Avid its rush, that reeling blaze!
Where is my father and Eleanor?
Not where are they now, dead seven years,   
But what they were then?
                                     No more? No more?
From Nineteen-Fourteen to the present day,   
Bert Spira and Rhoda consume, consume
Not where they are now (where are they now?)   
But what they were then, both beautiful; 
Each minute bursts in the burning room,   
The great globe reels in the solar fire,   
Spinning the trivial and unique away.
(How all things flash! How all things flare!)   
What am I now that I was then?   
May memory restore again and again   
The smallest color of the smallest day:   
Time is the school in which we learn,   
Time is the fire in which we burn.

There was a graven image of Desire       Painted with red blood on a ground of gold       Passing between the young men and the old, And by him Pain, whose body shone like fire, And Pleasure with gaunt hands that grasped their hire.       Of his left wrist, with fingers clenched and cold,       The insatiable Satiety kept hold, Walking with feet unshod that pashed the mire. The senses and the sorrows and the sins,       And the strange loves that suck the breasts of Hate Till lips and teeth bite in their sharp indenture, Followed like beasts with flap of wings and fins.       Death stood aloof behind a gaping grate, Upon whose lock was written Peradventure.

In Rome on the Campo dei Fiori
baskets of olives and lemons,
cobbles spattered with wine
and the wreckage of flowers.
Vendors cover the trestles
with rose-pink fish;
armfuls of dark grapes
heaped on peach-down. 
On this same square
they burned Giordano Bruno.
Henchmen kindled the pyre
close-pressed by the mob.
Before the flames had died
the taverns were full again,
baskets of olives and lemons
again on the vendors' shoulders. 
I thought of the Campo dei Fiori
in Warsaw by the sky-carousel
one clear spring evening
to the strains of a carnival tune.
The bright melody drowned
the salvos from the ghetto wall,
and couples were flying
high in the cloudless sky. 
At times wind from the burning
would drift dark kites along
and riders on the carousel
caught petals in midair.
That same hot wind
blew open the skirts of the girls
and the crowds were laughing
on that beautiful Warsaw Sunday. 
Someone will read as moral
that the people of Rome or Warsaw
haggle, laugh, make love
as they pass by the martyrs' pyres.
Someone else will read
of the passing of things human,
of the oblivion
born before the flames have died. 
But that day I thought only
of the loneliness of the dying,
of how, when Giordano
climbed to his burning
he could not find
in any human tongue
words for mankind,
mankind who live on. 
Already they were back at their wine
or peddled their white starfish,
baskets of olives and lemons
they had shouldered to the fair,
and he already distanced
as if centuries had passed
while they paused just a moment
for his flying in the fire. 
Those dying here, the lonely
forgotten by the world,
our tongue becomes for them
the language of an ancient planet.
Until, when all is legend
and many years have passed,
on a new Campo dei Fiori
rage will kindle at a poet's word.   Warsaw, 1943

Because the silence of the dead,
that blue expanse of sky about
to ashen here above my head,
is easily ignored, our tears
are blamed on flowers whitening limbs
of trees, the very air, with hymns
of summer pollen no one hears
except for women—old, devout. 
And now, these humid months, dispute
them not: midsummer has no name
among the dead, no Latin root
to which it can be traced, no swarm
of conjugations to decipher.
So little left to write this summer,
my mind now weak in handling form,
which I still cling to just the same.

When the mule balked, he hit him
sometimes with the flat of a hand
upside the head; more often
the stick he carried did its angry trick.
The mule’s job was to power the press,
iron on iron that wrung the sugar
out of cane, circling under the coarse
beam attached to his shoulders and neck.
That mule of my childhood
was black, remained blackly obedient
as round and round he made himself
the splintered hand of a clock, the groan
and squeak of machinery chewing
the reedy stalks to pulp, each second
delivering another sweet thin drop
into the black pot at the center. 
He hit him with a rag, old headrag,
but the animal winced only with the thrash
of a cane stalk itself—he squinted
under the rule of that bamboo.
The sun was another caning
on his black-hot flesh. He was slow
as the blackstrap syrup the boiled sugar made,
so true to the circle he dragged
we hardly saw him. We loved the rustling
house of green cane, blind in that field
of tropical grasses whose white plumes
announced the long season’s wait.
We yearned for the six-foot stem, the eventual
six pieces the machete sliced
at the joints, then the woody exterior
peeled back lengthwise with a blade.
It was a black hand we waited for, his job
to lay bare the grainy fiber we chewed.
That juice on our tongues
was his sweetness at work.
Chester was his name, he kept the mule.

Heureux ceux qui ont la clim—Corse-Matin (6.8.94)



Heureux ceux qui ont la clim
Pendant la grande canicule.
Heureux those whose culs are cool.   
Heureuse her and heureux him. 
C’est la canicule qui hurle,
Ready to tear you limb from limb.   
Heureux ceux qui ont la clim,   
Cri-criant: ‘O turlútuturle!’ 
La situation est grim,
The mise-en-scène a trifle burle.
À chaleur disons donc: ‘Ta gueule!’
And keep ourselves amused and slim. 
Heureux qui par terre se roule:   
Lucky Luke and Lucky Jim,   
Edith Piaf, Tiger Tim,
Et le plus divin Poupoule. 
Heureux Toccate, heureux Hymne,   
Heureux Mouvements Perpetuels,   
Heureuses Les Bîches immortelles,   
De tristesse sexuelle synonyme. 
Je ne regrette rien. I’m full
Of love as are the seraphim,
And plein de bonheur to the brim,   
Pendant cette grande canicule. 
La vie has satisfying sym:
For every lui there lives an elle.   
Finding its level in her well,
La source sauvage is in the swim. 
Ni ouragan ni canicule,
Ni pretexte prompte ou assez flim,   
Can keep le coeur from feeling imm,   
Allègre in the planet’s pull. 
Let’s fly together in a bim,
Au-dessus de la fou-foule
Qui mange ses menus et ses moules,   
Impregné de sueur, et prim! 
For always I’ll have you, and you’ll   
Have me, and though desire grows dim,   
Heureux ceux qui ont la quim,
Heureuses celles qui ont le tool. 
Forever through the sky will skim   
Le pé-pédalo de Dédale,
Escaladant sans escale
The blue horizon’s endless rim. 
En pénitence, le tournesol   
Beguiné, poudreuz, anonyme,   
Turns and turns, and at a whim   
Sonne, en sol, son son du sol. 
From Chatellerault to Arles and Nîmes   
Le visage bronze du tournesol   
S’incline comme un pa-parasol   
Trouve une épaule coquette, intime. 
Devisé dans le banderole:
‘Heureux ceux qui ont la clim.’
Across the fields the notes are dim:   
Son sol, son sol, son sol, son sol.

There is a garden in the memory of America
There is a nightbird in its memory
There is an andante cantabile
in a garden in the memory   
of America
In a secret garden
in a private place
a song a melody
a nightsong echoing
in the memory of America   
In the sound of a nightbird   
outside a Lowell window
In the cry of kids
in tenement yards at night
In the deep sound
of a woman murmuring
a woman singing broken melody
in a shuttered room
in an old wood house
in Lowell
As the world cracks by
                                 thundering
like a lost lumber truck
                                    on a steep grade   
               in Kerouac America
The woman sits silent now
                                     rocking backward   
      to Whistler’s Mother in Lowell
                         and all the tough old
                                          Canuck mothers   
                              and Jack’s Mémère
And they continue rocking 
      And may still on stormy nights show through   
          as a phantom after-image
                            on silent TV screens   
             a flickered after-image
                              that will not go away   
                in Moody Street
                  in Beaulieu Street

                        the clouts of the
                                       Shrouded Stranger
                  upon each wood pew
      where the likes of Kerouack lumberjack
             feinted their defiance
                                 of dung and death
Ah the broken wood and the punka fans still turning   
          (pull-cord wavings
                                     of the breath of the Buddha)

                     blowing his hands in winter
             as if to light a flame
    The Shrouded Stranger knew him
         as Ti-Jean the Smiler

            down by the riverrun
                              (O mighty Merrimac

            young Ti-Jean danced with Mémère

         all one with Buddha
                           in his arms   6. 
And then Ti-Jean Jack with Joual tongue
      disguised as an American fullback in plaid shirt   
          crossing and recrossing America
                                             in speedy cars   
    a Dr. Sax’s shadow shadowing him
      like a shroudy cloud over the landscape   
       Song of the Open Road sung drunken
               with Whitman and Jack London and Thomas Wolfe
            still echoing through
                            a Nineteen Thirties America   
                            A Nineteen Forties America   
                            an America now long gone
               except in broken down dusty old
                                              Greyhound Bus stations
                   in small lost towns
       Ti-Jean’s vision of America
                seen from a moving car window
                      the same as Wolfe’s lonely
                                                sweeping vision
                  glimpsed from a coach-train long ago
       (‘And thus did he see first the dark land’)   
And so Jack
                in an angel midnight bar
   somewhere West of Middle America
          where one drunk madonna
                        (shades of one on a Merrimac corner)   
      makes him a gesture with her eyes
                                                       a blue gesture   
          and Ti-Jean answers
                                       only with his eyes   
And the night goes on with them
       And the light comes up on them
                      making love in a parking lot   7. 
In the dark of his fellaheen night
    in the light of the illuminated

                                           by roar of river

The low sandy beach and the thin scrub pine,The wide reach of bay and the long sky line,—
   O, I am sick for home!
The salt, salt smell of the thick sea air,And the smooth round stones that the ebbtides wear,—
   When will the good ship come?
The wretched stumps all charred and burned,And the deep soft rut where the cartwheel turned,—
   Why is the world so old?
The lapping wave, and the broad gray skyWhere the cawing crows and the slow gulls fly,
   Where are the dead untold?
The thin, slant willows by the flooded bog,The huge stranded hulk and the floating log,
   Sorrow with life began!
And among the dark pines, and along the flat shore,O the wind, and the wind, for evermore!
   What will become of man?

He (my captor) gave me a bisquit, which I put in my pocket, and not daring to eat it, buried it under a log, fearing he had put something in it to make me love him.
—From the narrative of the captivity of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson, who was taken prisoner by the Wampanoag when Lancaster, Massachusetts, was destroyed, in the year 1676



The stream was swift, and so cold   
I thought I would be sliced in two.   
But he dragged me from the flood   
by the ends of my hair.
I had grown to recognize his face.
I could distinguish it from the others.   
There were times I feared I understood   
his language, which was not human,   
and I knelt to pray for strength. 
We were pursued by God’s agents   
or pitch devils, I did not know.
Only that we must march.
Their guns were loaded with swan shot.
I could not suckle and my child’s wail   
put them in danger.
He had a woman
with teeth black and glittering.   
She fed the child milk of acorns.
The forest closed, the light deepened. 
I told myself that I would starve
before I took food from his hands   
but I did not starve.
One night
he killed a deer with a young one in her   
and gave me to eat of the fawn.
It was so tender,
the bones like the stems of flowers,   
that I followed where he took me.   
The night was thick. He cut the cord   
that bound me to the tree. 
After that the birds mocked.
Shadows gaped and roared
and the trees flung down
their sharpened lashes.
He did not notice God’s wrath.
God blasted fire from half-buried stumps.
I hid my face in my dress, fearing He would burn us all   
but this, too, passed. 
Rescued, I see no truth in things.   
My husband drives a thick wedge   
through the earth, still it shuts   
to him year after year.
My child is fed of the first wheat.   
I lay myself to sleep
on a Holland-laced pillowbeer.   
I lay to sleep.
And in the dark I see myself   
as I was outside their circle. 
They knelt on deerskins, some with sticks,   
and he led his company in the noise   
until I could no longer bear
the thought of how I was.
I stripped a branch
and struck the earth,
in time, begging it to open
to admit me
as he was
and feed me honey from the rock.

Not to conform to any other color
is the secret of being colorful. 
He shocks us when he flies
like a red verb over the snow. 
He sifts through the blue evenings
to his roost. 
He is turning purple.
Soon he'll be black. 
In the bar's dark I think of him.
There are no cardinals here. 
Only a woman in a red dress.

Care for thy soul as thing of greatest price,       Made to the end to taste of power divine, Devoid of guilt, abhorring sin and vice,       Apt by God’s grace to virtue to incline. Care for it so as by thy retchless train It be not brought to taste eternal pain.  Care for thy corse, but chiefly for soul’s sake;       Cut off excess, sustaining food is best; To vanquish pride but comely clothing take;       Seek after skill, deep ignorance detest. Care so, I say, the flesh to feed and clothe That thou harm not thy soul and body both.  Care for the world to do thy body right;       Rack not thy wit to win thy wicked ways; Seek not to oppress the weak by wrongful might;       To pay thy due do banish all delays. Care to dispend according to thy store, And in like sort be mindful of the poor.  Care for thy soul, as for thy chiefest stay;       Care for thy body for thy soul’s avail; Care for the world for body’s help alway;       Care yet but so as virtue may prevail. Care in such sort that thou be sure of this: Care keep thee not from heaven and heavenly bliss.

I was lying loose from God. Strange is it not best   
Beloved, in the New World, in this skinny life, 
Intemperate with chance, my spirit quickens   
For the fall’s estate. In India, the half 
Hour is the hour, we were like that then—
Jammed wrong & wrong in the diurnal 
Mangy chambers of our carnall
Hearts, the rose robes rustling loose as velvet 
Curtains at the stage prow, passing   
Into the strange salt air of an Indian 
Ocean, hoarding kindling, heading   
West with hours, later than we might 
Have known, counting tins of meats & oil left,   
If they should lose or last the night.

1    I look at my hands
      In a dark hour.
      They are my wife,
      Another life,
      Fawnal,
      Explicitly made.
      I compare responsibility
      To journey:
      They are pitch-black
      Whirling in the outside world
      Left behind like a native—
      Possessed. 
2    We are older:
      Toil is our long way
      Back home.
      It works.
      Causes the space to beat
      Like a heart.
      It is a part of the poem
      That appears
      And appears on its own.
      It goes on
      On its own,
      Mystical as evil
      But, it is called freedom. 
3    I’m sorry:
      I was telling you about my hands.
      How well we are married.
      It follows,
      I recognize all truth
      As some part of ten.
      Spirit is my thumb,
      Passionately.
      Without thumb
      I would be nothing.
      I have met some who believe in reason.
      They have had too much wine,
      Confess cause and effect—
      It has been painful. 
4    I told you it is unreasonable:
      I guess I should say here,
      I am your carpenter.
      Ethnically, dark wood
      Is my life.
      I could show you my story better,
      Sanding,
      Then where I speak
      You would hear
                     Africa
                     Africa

Hef brings me flowers
tiger lilies, ochre veined
downcast, sleek black cups 
small shadows, are the
puckers in his pyjamas
where his skin caves in 
tired profligate, I
sigh and pour the oil along
your circular sheets 
thinking of all the
times, or women on this bed
glossy old bunnies 
I imagine their
breasts, plate of fried eggs, a row
of tonsured monks’ heads 
his tongue slithers, gaunt
voluptuary, ugly
old man, my eyes close 
when I roll his name
Ner. along my tongue, like the
line of cold test tubes 
thin bottled semen,
he wants to plant it, deeply
in my flat belly 
Hugh junior, and, or
Carietta, a child is
packed in dry blue ice 
in silk pyjamas
they have an emperor’s crest
it is dark in there 
but it’s cold as
the green jacuzzi, bubbles
are clouds on its face 
I will crush the glass
with the fingers in his back
and pile on my rings 
and all the fur coats
and move down the circular
stairs, bloated with gold 
the flowers are a
venus-flytrap, with red curls
flames and noxious breath 
his betrayal gives
me granite fists, girls scatter
movie stars crumple 
as I run away,
from the gaudy prison cell,
of tinsel and skin 
I’ll sue him and write
and build a home, in the
desert, on the sun 
a sequined empress,
a mirage—in loungewear and
harlequin glasses

A Ballad of the Republic, Sung in the Year 1888



The outlook wasn’t brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;
The score stood four to two with but one inning more to play.
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game. 
A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
They thought if only Casey could but get a whack at that—
We’d put up even money now with Casey at the bat. 
But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
And the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake;
So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
For there seemed but little chance of Casey’s getting to the bat. 
But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
And Blake, the much despised, tore the cover off the ball;
And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third. 
Then from 5,000 throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
It knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat. 
There was ease in Casey’s manner as he stepped into his place;
There was pride in Casey’s bearing and a smile on Casey’s face.
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
No stranger in the crowd could doubt ’twas Casey at the bat. 
Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt.
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
Defiance gleamed in Casey’s eye, a sneer curled Casey’s lip. 
And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—
“That ain’t my style,” said Casey. “Strike one,” the umpire said. 
From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,
Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore.
“Kill him! Kill the umpire!” shouted some one on the stand;
And it’s likely they’d have killed him had not Casey raised his hand. 
With a smile of Christian charity great Casey’s visage shone;
He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;
He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;
But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, “Strike two.” 
“Fraud!” cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered fraud;
But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,
And they knew that Casey wouldn’t let that ball go by again. 
The sneer is gone from Casey’s lip, his teeth are clinched in hate;
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey’s blow. 
Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;
But there is no joy in Mudville—mighty Casey has struck out.

My mind is shuffling its deck tonight,   
slipping one card over another,   
letting them all fall together at the corners;   
the random hand of memory
is dealing from the bottom of the pack. 
First: a bearded man emptying
the dragon kiln, then a woman
whistling, her face turned away   
as she opens the oven. Next:   
a big cat, six toes on each paw,   
climbing up the yardpole. Last:   
a pair of workhorses circling a tree
until they grind themselves to dust. 
There is no one home in the world
tonight. Everyone is out of range.
The cradles are empty, the boughs
broken down. Trees go helter-skelter
and the wheel is creaking on its shaft.
Hit me, I say to the dealer. Hit me again.


^^EOP^^

O Hymen king. 
Hymen, O Hymen king,
what bitter thing is this?
what shaft, tearing my heart?
what scar, what light, what fire
searing my eye-balls and my eyes with flame?
nameless, O spoken name,
king, lord, speak blameless Hymen. 
Why do you blind my eyes?
why do you dart and pulse
till all the dark is home,
then find my soul
and ruthless draw it back?
scaling the scaleless,
opening the dark?
speak, nameless, power and might;
when will you leave me quite?
when will you break my wings
or leave them utterly free
to scale heaven endlessly? 
A bitter, broken thing,
my heart, O Hymen lord,
yet neither drought nor sword
baffles men quite,
why must they feign to fear
my virgin glance?
feigned utterly or real
why do they shrink?
my trance frightens them,
breaks the dance,
empties the market-place;
if I but pass they fall
back, frantically;
must always people mock?
unless they shrink and reel
as in the temple
at your uttered will. 
O Hymen king,
lord, greatest, power, might,
look for my face is dark,
burnt with your light,
your fire, O Hymen lord;
is there none left
can equal me
in ecstasy, desire?
is there none left
can bear with me
the kiss of your white fire?
is there not one,
Phrygian or frenzied Greek,
poet, song-swept, or bard,
one meet to take from me
this bitter power of song,
one fit to speak, Hymen,
your praises, lord? 
May I not wed
as you have wed?
may it not break, beauty,
from out my hands, my head, my feet?
may Love not lie beside me
till his heat
burn me to ash?
may he not comfort me, then,
spent of all that fire and heat,
still, ashen-white and cool
as the wet laurels,
white, before your feet
step on the mountain-slope,
before your fiery hand
lift up the mantle
covering flower and land,
as a man lifts,
O Hymen, from his bride,
(cowering with woman eyes,) the veil?
O Hymen lord, be kind.


^^EOP^^

To me, one silly task is like another.
I bare the shambling tricks of lust and pride.   
This flesh will never give a child its mother,—
Song, like a wing, tears through my breast, my side,   
And madness chooses out my voice again,   
Again. I am the chosen no hand saves:   
The shrieking heaven lifted over men,   
Not the dumb earth, wherein they set their graves.

Mine, says the cat, putting out his paw of darkness.
My lover, my friend, my slave, my toy, says
the cat making on your chest his gesture of drawing
milk from his mother’s forgotten breasts. 
Let us walk in the woods, says the cat.
I’ll teach you to read the tabloid of scents,
to fade into shadow, wait like a trap, to hunt.
Now I lay this plump warm mouse on your mat. 
You feed me, I try to feed you, we are friends,
says the cat, although I am more equal than you.
Can you leap twenty times the height of your body?
Can you run up and down trees? Jump between roofs? 
Let us rub our bodies together and talk of touch.
My emotions are pure as salt crystals and as hard.
My lusts glow like my eyes. I sing to you in the mornings
walking round and round your bed and into your face. 
Come I will teach you to dance as naturally
as falling asleep and waking and stretching long, long.
I speak greed with my paws and fear with my whiskers.
Envy lashes my tail. Love speaks me entire, a word 
of fur. I will teach you to be still as an egg
and to slip like the ghost of wind through the grass.

The catalpa’s white week is ending there
in its corner of my yard. It has its arms full
of its own flowering now, but the least air
spills off a petal and a breeze lets fall
whole coronations. There is not much more
of what this is. Is every gladness quick?
That tree’s a nuisance, really. Long before
the summer’s out, its beans, long as a stick,
will start to shed. And every year one limb
cracks without falling off and hangs there dead
till I get up and risk my neck to trim
what it knows how to lose but not to shed.
I keep it only for this one white pass.
The end of June’s its garden; July, its Fall;
all else, the world remembering what it was
in the seven days of its visible miracle. 
What should I keep if averages were all?


^^EOP^^

Rain will fall again
on your smooth pavement,
a light rain like
a breath or a step.
The breeze and the dawn
will flourish again
when you return,
as if beneath your step.
Between flowers and sills
the cats will know. 
There will be other days,
there will be other voices.
You will smile alone.
The cats will know.
You will hear words
old and spent and useless
like costumes left over
from yesterday’s parties. 
You too will make gestures.
You’ll answer with words—
face of springtime,
you too will make gestures. 
The cats will know,
face of springtime;
and the light rain
and the hyacinth dawn
that wrench the heart of him
who hopes no more for you—
they are the sad smile
you smile by yourself. 
There will be other days,
other voices and renewals.
Face of springtime,
we will suffer at daybreak.


^^EOP^^

Soft kisses may be innocent;But ah! too easy maid, beware;Tho’ that is all thy kindness meant,’Tis love’s delusive, fatal snare.
No virgin e’er at first design’dThro’ all the maze of love to stray;But each new path allures her mind,Till wandering on, she lose her way.
’Tis easy ere set out to stay;But who the useful art can teach,When sliding down a steepy way,To stop, before the end we reach?
Keep ever something in thy power,Beyond what would thy honour stain:He will not dare to aim at more,Who for small favours sighs in vain.

I’ve carved a cave in the mountainside.
I’ve drilled for water, stocked provisions
to last a lifetime. The walls are smooth.
We can live here, love, safe from elements.
We’ll invent another love that can’t destroy.
We’ll make exquisite reproductions of our
selves, immortal on these walls. 
                                                 And when
this sea that can’t support us is burned clean,
when the first new creatures crawl from it,
gasping for water, air, more wondrous and more
wild than earth’s first couple, they shall see
there were two before them: you and me.

When first the apprizing eye and tongue that muttered
(Banished from Eden’s air? Or pride of apes?)
Sat clinking flint on flint, as they shattered
Snatched with a grin what fell in craftier shapes,
The law was move or die. Lively from tigers;
Dainty on deer. As weather called the tune.
Oxen, we learned, would bear us. So would rivers.
And that was science. On the whole a boon. 
What caveman on a round rock dumped a-grunting
Rubbed at a rueful hip, brow darkening why?
Or gaped at boulders over gravel shifting
Until—a splendor of wheel-thought like sunrise!
No wonder: such example in a heaven
Revving immaculate gears, and at his feet
The planet on her axle greased and even.
Put any wheel to earth, and two wheels meet. 
Athens cut ruts of marble; ivory courses
Caromed Apollo’s car of talkative gold.
And Donne saw wagon-ways. The horsepower: horse
Over the flats of Kansas sail-cars rolled.
First planks on querulous ground, then treads of met
Steel set edgewise, over stone for ties.
A mountain? Sawtooth rail or crank-and-cable
Till iron took serene the incredulous rise. 
Compleat with a nifty moniker, Puffing Billy,
Best Friend of Charleston, Wabash Cannonball,
Cycloped

Pei designed the building with views,   
smooth masonry, and the mountains aligned
for a photo opportunity; inside are files
sufficient for forever, for fine tuning weather. 
Great Spangled Fritillary, the watcher vaguely recalls
from Teach Yourself Lepidoptery, a book.
He wanted to live in a land of appropriate weather
with views of mountains and with music constant. 
He wants to tell a story but no one would listen,
like opera: Black women clean the floors
and shine the walls like silver nightly.
Computers whir Platonic as nuns. Nothing 
escapes naming; storms arranged in teacups
like anyone’s collection, like rows of butterflies
pinned and satisfactory: this is the new landscape.
Or there is a lewd father among the shrubbery 
watching daughters in weather; he breathes heavily
and the wet wisdom begins, the storm gathering
to spill across the ridge, longed for.
Daughters must be warned against sincerity 
of frantic violins: “He was a man of sympathetic   
tendencies,” read the official report. “He was
smaller than he looked and tended to lick chocolate
from his fingers in a lascivious manner.” 
He tried his wife’s patience, it is true,
and lived alone through the marriage, kept
his own counsel. With such petty symbols as
weather, he kept his own counsel. 
A butterfly like weather; the climate like
laughter, the movement of small air. Clouds, too,
have names. Clouds leave home to find themselves.
Good money after bad, the fathers say, and close    
the door called Nature against their coming back.
The funny little ways children have of making
the world the color they always wanted. Sunset.
Birds. The mathematics of memory begin 
to swirl like cookie dough, like chocolate with egg
and sugar and vanilla and butter. A bowl to lick,
dangerous with delight, as ultraviolet. Home again!
begs the mother and soon the sorry child walks 
that long allée as rain begins to pour.   Past   
such petty symbols the boy returns through architecture,   
a silly gauntlet: the butterfly, the mother, the fit
signatures of loveliness. His parents at the door, 
the little cottage in the woods, Hansel home again
at last, the shining path. A little like a dream.
Ours is not a simple age, and things are what they seem
happily ever after in the malicious tiny rain.

Once in late summer,
the road already deep in twilight,
mixing colors with some straggly
wildflowers, I came to a village
I did not know was there
                                     until
I stepped into its narrow street.
Admiring the prim, white houses
nestled among their veteran,
lofty trees,
                   I found myself in
a tiny square with a little dawdl-
ing fountain and a rickety tower,
its owlish clock absentmindedly
counting minutes now and then. 
And in the fountain the face
of morning seemed to linger as
though searching. The air was fresh,
breathing out the fragrances
of a recent shower.
                              I luxuriated
in my senses, like meeting
unexpectedly a pack of friends
years and years unthought of, laden
with all kinds of gifts.
                                     Then
as I stopped to knock at the door
of a house that had seemed occupied
with happy noises, a silence
fell on it,
                  the light went out—
and was it instant eyes like flakes,
ten thousand, thousand flakes,
and all unknowing, flurried
round me?
               Wherever I turned
I was met by the unmistakable
accusation, “Stranger!” I, who had,
I thought, begun here and who now
required lodgings
                           for the night,
was denied and from the start.

This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,
 Sails the unshadowed main,—
 The venturous bark that flingsOn the sweet summer wind its purpled wingsIn gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,
 And coral reefs lie bare,Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.
Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;
 Wrecked is the ship of pearl!
 And every chambered cell,Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,
 Before thee lies revealed,—Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!
Year after year beheld the silent toil
 That spread his lustrous coil;
 Still, as the spiral grew,He left the past year’s dwelling for the new,Stole with soft step its shining archway through,
 Built up its idle door,Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.
Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,
 Child of the wandering sea,
 Cast from her lap, forlorn!From thy dead lips a clearer note is bornThan ever Triton blew from wreathèd horn!
 While on mine ear it rings,Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:—
Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
 As the swift seasons roll!
 Leave thy low-vaulted past!Let each new temple, nobler than the last,Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
 Till thou at length art free,Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea!

Soldiers never do die well;          Crosses mark the places— Wooden crosses where they fell,          Stuck above their faces. Soldiers pitch and cough and twitch—          All the world roars red and black; Soldiers smother in a ditch,          Choking through the whole attack.

I know him, that man
walking- toward me up the crowded street
of the city, I have lived with him
seven years now, I know his fast stride,
his windy wheatfield hair, his hands thrust   
deep in his jacket pockets, hands
that have known my body, touched
its softest part, caused its quick shudders   
and slow releasings, I have seen his face   
above my face, his mouth smiling, moaning   
his eyes closed and opened, I have studied
his eyes, the brown turning gold at the centers,   
I have silently watched him lying beside me   
in the early morning, I know his loneliness,   
like mine, human and sad,
but different, too, his private pain
and pleasure I can never enter even as he comes   
closer, past trees and cars, trash and flowers,   
steam rising from the manhole covers,   
gutters running with rain, he lifts his head,   
he sees me, we are strangers again,   
and a rending music of desire and loss—
I don’t know him—courses through me,
and we kiss and say, It’s good to see you,
as if we haven’t seen each other in years   
when it was just a few hours ago,
and we are shy, then, not knowing   
what to say next.

That night your great guns, unawares,
Shook all our coffins as we lay,
And broke the chancel window-squares,
We thought it was the Judgment-day 
And sat upright. While drearisome
Arose the howl of wakened hounds:
The mouse let fall the altar-crumb,
The worms drew back into the mounds, 
The glebe cow drooled. Till God called, “No;
It’s gunnery practice out at sea
Just as before you went below;
The world is as it used to be: 
“All nations striving strong to make
Red war yet redder. Mad as hatters
They do no more for Christés sake
Than you who are helpless in such matters. 
“That this is not the judgment-hour
For some of them’s a blessed thing,
For if it were they’d have to scour
Hell’s floor for so much threatening.... 
“Ha, ha. It will be warmer when
I blow the trumpet (if indeed
I ever do; for you are men,
And rest eternal sorely need).” 
So down we lay again. “I wonder,
Will the world ever saner be,”
Said one, “than when He sent us under
In our indifferent century!” 
And many a skeleton shook his head.
“Instead of preaching forty year,”
My neighbour Parson Thirdly said,
“I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer.” 
Again the guns disturbed the hour,
Roaring their readiness to avenge,
As far inland as Stourton Tower,
And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge.

The nominalist in me invents
A life devoid of precedents.
The realist takes a different view:
He claims that all I feel and do
Billions of others felt and did
In history’s Pre-me period. 
Arguing thus, both voices speak
A partial truth. I am unique,
Yet the unceasing self-distress
Of desire buffets me no less
Than it has other sons of man
Who’ve come and gone since time began. 
The meaning, then, of this dispute?
My life’s a nominal/real pursuit,
Which leaves identity clear and blurred,
In which what happens has occurred
Often and never—which is to say,
Never to me, or quite this way.

Let’s get this straight: Charles Graner   
is not America. America would never   
hold a knife to his wife’s throat, then say
when she woke that he was considering
killing her. And America’s wife in turn
would never call her husband “my own
Hannibal Lecter.” Am I right, or what?   
Charles Graner may be Hannibal Lecter,   
but he is not America. America is not that   
kind of husband. Nor would America email
his adolescent children photos of himself
torturing naked Iraqi prisoners and say
“look what Daddy gets to do!” Am I right?
America is not that kind of father. America   
would never torture naked Iraqi prisoners.   
Let’s be absolutely clear about all of this.
And America’s ex-lover and co-defendant
would never whisper to the sketch artist   
at America’s trial: “You forgot the horns.”   
Charles Graner may or may not have horns,
but America is horn-free. America does not
torture prisoners. America may render them,   
fully clothed, to Egypt or Syria, for further   
interrogation, or to men like Charles Graner,   
but America is not, ipso facto, Egypt or Syria,   
and Charles Graner is not now nor has he ever
been America. And don’t talk to me about
Guantanamo. Please! Let’s get this straight.   
You and I know who America is. We know   
what America does and doesn’t do, because we
(not Charles Graner!) are America. Am I right?   
Is this all clear? Tell me—am I right, or what?

Meryon saw it coming (who was he?):
No people, so no noise. As it should be.
The Bridge. The Morgue. Ghostly round his bed
Antipodean atolls and tattoos had fluted, 
Volcanoes puffed. Then borborygmic sea
Forked, at its last gasp, into a V:
Down that black gallery and backward slid
A syrup, foul, ovum and sperm concocted,
The foggy groan of Antichrist. 1863:
People mattered nothing, live or dead. 
Paris by his impeccable etchings emptied:
Pointy turrets, windows, not a single head
Poking out—and there across the sky,
Tortuous, the skeleton birds creak by. 
2
As if all the steps had stopped
As if all the takes had token
As if all the creaks had croaken
As if all that weeps had wopped 
As if all that flips had flopped
As if all that mocks had moaken
As if all that speaks had spoken
As if all that drips had dropped 
As if all that hopes had hopped
As if all that leaps had lopped
As if all that aches had oaken
As if all that peaks had poken
As if all that creeps had cropped
As if all that peeps had popped

The old aquaforte art is back, thought Baudelaire.
Multiple majesty of stone piled on stone;
Obelisks of industry discharge into the air
Their coalescent smoke. Almost airborne
Scaffoldings roped to monuments under repair—
Very poetic, beauty so paradoxical I never saw the like; 
                        and the sky over it all— Eagles. Tumult. Perspective deepens there With all the dramas that have come and gone. 
The artist: Once a sailor, now he’ll seek
In nooks of masonry a sphinx. 
                            I think you’d get a scare
To hear him talk

^^EOP^^

The stage is set for imminent disaster.
Here is the little tramp, standing
On a stack of books in order
To reach the microphone, the
Poet he’s impersonating somehow
Trussed and mumbling in a
Tweed bundle at his feet. 
He opens his mouth: Tra-la!
Out comes doves, incandescent bulbs,
Plastic roses. Well, that’s that,
Squirms the young professor who’s
Coordinated this, No more visiting poets! 
His department head groans
For the trap door. As it
Swings away 
The tramp keeps on as if
Nothing has occurred,
A free arm mimicking
A wing.

Some say that Chattanooga is the
Old name for Lookout Mountain
To others it is an uncouth name
Used only by the uncivilised
Our a-historical period sees it
As merely a town in Tennessee
To old timers of the Volunteer State
Chattanooga is “The Pittsburgh of
The South”
According to the Cherokee
Chattanooga is a rock that
Comes to a point 
They’re all right
Chattanooga is something you
Can have anyway you want it
The summit of what you are
I’ve paid my fare on that
Mountain Incline #2, Chattanooga
I want my ride up
I want Chattanooga   2 
Like Nickajack a plucky Blood
I’ve escaped my battle near
Clover Bottom, braved the
Jolly Roger raising pirates
Had my near miss at Moccasin Bend
To reach your summit so
Give into me Chattanooga
I’ve dodged the Grey Confederate sharpshooters
Escaped my brother’s tomahawks with only
Some minor burns
Traversed a Chickamauga of my own
Making, so
You belong to me Chattanooga   3 
I take your East Ninth Street to my
Heart, pay court on your Market
Street of rubboard players and organ
Grinders of Haitian colors rioting
And old Zip Coon Dancers
I want to hear Bessie Smith belt out
I’m wild about that thing in
Your Ivory Theatre
Chattanooga
Coca-Cola’s homebase
City on my mind   4 
My 6th grade teacher asked me to
Name the highest mountain in the world
I didn’t even hesitate, “Lookout Mountain”
I shouted. They laughed
Eastern nitpickers, putting on the
Ritz laughed at my Chattanooga ways
Which means you’re always up to it 
To get to Chattanooga you must
Have your Tennessee
“She has as many lives as a
cat. As to killing her, even
the floods have failed
you may knock the breath out of
her that’s all. She will re-
fill her lungs and draw
a longer breath than ever”
From a Knoxville editorial—
1870s   5 
Chattanooga is a woman to me too
I want to run my hands through her
Hair of New Jersey tea and redroot
Aint no harm in that
Be caressed and showered in
Her Ruby Falls
That’s only natural
Heal myself in her
Minnehaha Springs
58 degrees F. all year
Around. Climb all over her
Ridges and hills
I wear a sign on my chest
“Chattanooga or bust”   6 
“HOLD CHATTANOOGA AT ALL HAZARDS”—Grant to Thomas 
When I tasted your big juicy
Black berries ignoring the rattle-
Snakes they said came to Cameron
Hill after the rain, I knew I
Had to have you Chattanooga
When I swam in Lincoln Park
Listening to Fats Domino sing
I found my thrill on Blueberry
Hill on the loudspeaker
I knew you were mine Chattanooga
Chattanooga whose Howard Negro
School taught my mother Latin
Tennyson and Dunbar
Whose Miller Bros. Department
Store cheated my Uncle out of
What was coming to him
A pension, he only had 6
Months to go
Chattanoooooooooooooooooga
Chattanoooooooooooooooooga
“WE WILL HOLD THIS TOWN TILL WE STARVE”-Thomas to Grant   7 
To get to Chattanooga you must
Go through your Tennessee
I’ve taken all the scotsboros
One state can dish out
Made Dr. Shockley’s “Monkey Trials”
The laughing stock of the Nation
Capt. Marvel Dr. Sylvanias shazam
Scientists running from light-
ning, so
Open your borders. Tennessee
Hide your TVA
DeSota determined, this
Serpent handler is coming
Through 
Are you ready Lookout Mountain? 
“Give all of my Generals what he’s
drinking,” Lincoln said, when the
Potomac crowd called Grant a lush   8 
I’m going to strut all over your
Point like Old Sam Grant did
My belly full of good Tennessee
Whiskey, puffing on
A.05 cigar
The campaign for Chattanooga
Behind me
Breathing a spell
Ponying up for
Appomattox!

For some people the day comes
when they have to declare the great Yes
or the great No. It’s clear at once who has the Yes
ready within him; and saying it, 
he goes from honor to honor, strong in his conviction.
He who refuses does not repent. Asked again,
he’d still say no. Yet that no—the right no—
drags him down all his life.

Like the waxwings in the juniper,
a dozen at a time, divided, paired,
passing the berries back and forth, and by
nightfall, wobbling, piping, wounded with joy. 
Or a party of redwings grazing what
falls—blossom and seed, nutmeat and fruit—
made light in the head and cut by the light,
swept from the ground, carried downwind, taken.... 
It's called wing-rowing, the wing-burdened arms
unbending, yielding, striking a balance,
walking the white invisible line drawn
just ahead in the air, first sign the slur, 
the liquid notes too liquid, the heart in
the mouth melodious, too close, which starts
the chanting, the crooning, the long lyric
silences, the song of our undoing. 
It's called side-step, head-forward, raised-crown, flap-
and-glide-flight aggression, though courtship is
the object, affection the compulsion,
love the overspill—the body nodding, 
still standing, ready to fly straight out of
itself—or its bill-tilt, wing-flash, topple-
over; wing-droop, bowing, tail-flick and drift;
back-ruffle, wingspread, quiver and soar. 
Someone is troubled, someone is trying,
in earnest, to explain; to speak without
swallowing the tongue; to find the perfect
word among so few or the too many— 
to sing like the thrush from the deepest part
of the understory, territorial,
carnal, thorn-at-the-throat, or flutelike
in order to make one sobering sound. 
Sound of the breath blown over the bottle,
sound of the reveler home at dawn, light of
the sun a warbler yellow, the sun in
song-flight, lopsided-pose. Be of good-cheer, 
my father says, lifting his glass to greet
a morning in which he's awake to be
with the birds: or up all night in the sleep
of the world, alive again, singing.

There is a garden in her face    Where roses and white lilies blow; A heavenly paradise is that place,    Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow:       There cherries grow which none may buy       Till “Cherry-ripe” themselves do cry.  Those cherries fairly do enclose    Of orient pearl a double row, Which when her lovely laughter shows,    They look like rose-buds filled with snow;       Yet them no peer nor prince can buy       Till “Cherry-ripe” themselves do cry.  Her eyes like angels watch them still;    Her brows like bended bows do stand, Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill    All that attempt with eye or hand       Those sacred cherries to come nigh,       Till “Cherry-ripe” themselves do cry.

Off Highway 106
At Cherrylog Road I entered   
The ’34 Ford without wheels,   
Smothered in kudzu,
With a seat pulled out to run
Corn whiskey down from the hills, 
And then from the other side   
Crept into an Essex
With a rumble seat of red leather   
And then out again, aboard   
A blue Chevrolet, releasing   
The rust from its other color, 
Reared up on three building blocks.   
None had the same body heat;
I changed with them inward, toward   
The weedy heart of the junkyard,   
For I knew that Doris Holbrook   
Would escape from her father at noon 
And would come from the farm   
To seek parts owned by the sun   
Among the abandoned chassis,   
Sitting in each in turn
As I did, leaning forward
As in a wild stock-car race 
In the parking lot of the dead.   
Time after time, I climbed in   
And out the other side, like   
An envoy or movie star
Met at the station by crickets.   
A radiator cap raised its head, 
Become a real toad or a kingsnake   
As I neared the hub of the yard,   
Passing through many states,   
Many lives, to reach
Some grandmother’s long Pierce-Arrow   
Sending platters of blindness forth 
From its nickel hubcaps
And spilling its tender upholstery
On sleepy roaches,
The glass panel in between   
Lady and colored driver   
Not all the way broken out, 
The back-seat phone
Still on its hook.
I got in as though to exclaim,   
“Let us go to the orphan asylum,   
John; I have some old toys
For children who say their prayers.” 
I popped with sweat as I thought   
I heard Doris Holbrook scrape
Like a mouse in the southern-state sun   
That was eating the paint in blisters   
From a hundred car tops and hoods.   
She was tapping like code, 
Loosening the screws,   
Carrying off headlights,   
Sparkplugs, bumpers,
Cracked mirrors and gear-knobs,   
Getting ready, already,
To go back with something to show 
Other than her lips’ new trembling   
I would hold to me soon, soon,   
Where I sat in the ripped back seat
Talking over the interphone,   
Praying for Doris Holbrook   
To come from her father’s farm 
And to get back there
With no trace of me on her face
To be seen by her red-haired father
Who would change, in the squalling barn,   
Her back’s pale skin with a strop,
Then lay for me 
In a bootlegger’s roasting car
With a string-triggered I2-gauge shotgun   
To blast the breath from the air.
Not cut by the jagged windshields,   
Through the acres of wrecks she came   
With a wrench in her hand, 
Through dust where the blacksnake dies   
Of boredom, and the beetle knows   
The compost has no more life.
Someone outside would have seen   
The oldest car's door inexplicably   
Close from within: 
I held her and held her and held her,   
Convoyed at terrific speed
By the stalled, dreaming traffic around us,   
So the blacksnake, stiff
With inaction, curved back
Into life, and hunted the mouse 
With deadly overexcitement,   
The beetles reclaimed their field   
As we clung, glued together,
With the hooks of the seat springs   
Working through to catch us red-handed   
Amidst the gray breathless batting 
That burst from the seat at our backs.   
We left by separate doors
Into the changed, other bodies
Of cars, she down Cherrylog Road   
And I to my motorcycle
Parked like the soul of the junkyard 
Restored, a bicycle fleshed
With power, and tore off
Up Highway 106, continually   
Drunk on the wind in my mouth,   
Wringing the handlebar for speed,   
Wild to be wreckage forever.

‘I have always felt that desolation,
that hell itself, is most powerfully expressed
in an uninhabited natural landscape
at its bleakest.’
—Anthony Hecht



1. 
To each his own hell. Mine was an uninhabited
landscape as far from nature as you can get
without actually leaving the planet, a man-made 
moon waste on Sixth Avenue in Brooklyn,
fired in the sun’s kiln through unending
afternoons when I was nine or ten. 
I can never get the whole scene put together
in my head, thanks to whatever guardian
spirit flags down potentially dangerous 
intruders on the verge of memory,
but parts of me hold parts of it: my ears
play out the hissing wires’ repeated rise 
and fall, dry waves breaking above pavement;
my nostrils chafe where fumes of gasoline
weep from soft tarred patches in the asphalt; 
through a chainlink grid, my eyes take in
some lot’s trapped beach, its black sand an amalgam
of gravel, soot, and broken glass; or they blink 
in sequence with the traffic light’s perpetual
solitaire at a carless intersection,
flicking over greens, ambers, reds; 
my hands remember enough not to touch
the shut steel trap doors of delivery chutes
where air trembles over surfaces 
as at their beginnings in a furnace.
What fills my mind to bursting is emptiness,
the spirit of inverted Genesis 
transforming light and water’s urge towards fullness
into a miracle of unearthly loss.   2. 
Sentries, a pair of gasoline pumps napped.
Their rubber arms dangled groundwards and looped
back up, hanging slack from the brass lapel 
their trigger-fingers hooked at shoulder height.
They were no angels, but kept the gate of hell
whenever I made visits to the angels. 
Behind them, next to a roll-up garage door
always rolled up, with an invisible car
always risen above the stone lintel 
on the hydraulic lift, a soft drink cooler
sat coffin-like against the stucco wall.
And always songs from a hidden radio 
promised cool mountain rivers to the hot
flat city: somebody else must have listened,
but I never saw a soul in all my visits. 
The angels’ wings fluttered the moment I raised
the lid, a potent shimmer, as if the sun
itself shone from the chest, not its reflections 
playing off the steel bars and icy waters.
The angels sat in rows between the bars,
their orders chevroned by the shapes and colours 
of their glass capes: the bluish, scalloped whorl
of cherubim, the powers’ straight sheer crystal,
the emerald flare of flaming seraphim— 
all emissaries from the sky-washed shore
of heaven. To put a coin in the dispenser,
slide one of them along its plated channel 
and lift it free through the chest’s narrow gate—
to kiss the cold stars of its distillation—
was not important; it was only important 
to see the angels swimming in the glitter
and dip my fingers in their flickering water
at the centre of that man-made desert, 
knowing that they were man-made, and might shatter.

(Sonata for an Orchestra)



Chicago is an overgrown woman
      wearing her skyscrapers
      like a necklace ...
Chicago’s blood is kaleidoscopic
Chicago’s heart has a hundred auricles

                                  is a long trek

Child of a day, thou knowest not
     The tears that overflow thy urn,The gushing eyes that read thy lot,

And why the wish! the pure and blest
     Watch like thy mother o'er thy sleep.O peaceful night! O envied rest!
     Thou wilt not ever see her weep.

Winter is fallen early
 On the house of Stare;Birds in reverberating flocks
 Haunt its ancestral box;
 Bright are the plenteous berries 
 In clusters in the air.
  Still is the fountain’s music,
 The dark pool icy still,Whereupon a small and sanguine sun 
 Floats in a mirror on,
 Into a West of crimson,
 From a South of daffodil.
  ’Tis strange to see young children 
 In such a wintry house;Like rabbits’ on the frozen snow
 Their tell-tale footprints go;
 Their laughter rings like timbrels 
 ’Neath evening ominous:
  Their small and heightened faces
 Like wine-red winter buds;Their frolic bodies gentle as 
 Flakes in the air that pass, 
 Frail as the twirling petal 
 From the briar of the woods.
  Above them silence lours,
 Still as an arctic sea;Light fails; night falls; the wintry moon 
 Glitters; the crocus soon
 Will open grey and distracted
 On earth’s austerity:
  Thick mystery, wild peril, 
 Law like an iron rod:—Yet sport they on in Spring’s attire,
 Each with his tiny fire 
 Blown to a core of ardour 
 By the awful breath of God.

In three directions
are two storms.
I instruct the edges
of my hands to become
irises, to shatter
in that way,
in three directions.
There's nothing behind me. 
Viols
claw beneath our fences
at the elevation
of sound to pure
unsanctity, the moment
of simultaneity:
airplanes seeming to collide and not colliding, the crow alighting
in the manner of a seabird, the carbomb a more than momentary poppy. 
The bad total
of death points one
direction.
It moves
at the edge of my hand
at the memorial service,
viols useless now
laid across their breasts,
the attitude of submission.    
I was eating dinner in a tall room. I was the third guest.
I felt a tightening in my asshole, and the yellow wine turned
to red, turned to your hand on another's woven onto tapestry.
How the month of June became our sons, so many bridges for one
river, was the story always delighted you. 
The carbomb was faster.
Simultaneous with the iris the viol
shatters in three directions.
Everything I have taken
claws helplessly at sunlight
that won't defend itself.
The red one is the poppy.

The dragon is in the street dancing beneath windows
   pasted with colored squares, past the man
who leans into the phone booth’s red pagoda, past
   crates of doves and roosters veiled 
until dawn. Fireworks complicate the streets
   with sulphur as people exchange gold
and silver foil, money to appease ghosts
   who linger, needy even in death. I am 
almost invisible. Hands could pass through me
   effortlessly. This is how it is
to be so alien that my name falls from me, grows
   untranslatable as the shop signs, 
the odors of ginseng and black fungus that idle
   in the stairwell, the corridor where
the doors are blue months ajar. Hands
   gesture in the smoke, the partial moon 
of a face. For hours the soft numeric
   click of mah-jongg tiles drifts
down the hallway where languid Mai trails
   her musk of sex and narcotics. 
There is no grief in this, only the old year
   consuming itself, the door knob blazing
in my hand beneath the lightbulb’s electric jewel.
   Between voices and fireworks 
wind works bricks to dust—hush, hush—
   no language I want to learn. I can touch
the sill worn by hands I’ll never know
   in this room with its low table 
where I brew chrysanthemum tea. The sign
   for Jade Palace sheds green corollas
on the floor. It’s dangerous to stand here
   in the chastening glow, darkening 
my eyes in the mirror with the gulf of the rest
   of my life widening away from me, waiting
for the man I married to pass beneath
   the sign of the building, to climb 
the five flights and say his Chinese name for me.
   He’ll rise up out of the puzzling streets
where men pass bottles of rice liquor, where
   the new year is liquor, the black bottle 
the whole district is waiting for, like
   some benevolent arrest—the moment
when men and women turn to each other and dissolve
   each bad bet, every sly mischance, 
the dalliance of hands. They turn in lamplight
   the way I turn now. Wai Min is in the doorway.
He brings fish. He brings lotus root.
   He brings me ghost money.

And in a little while we broke under the strain:   
suppurations ad nauseam, the wanting to be taller,   
though it‘s simply about being mysterious, i.e., not taller,   
like any tree in any forest.
                                           Mute, the pancake describes you.
It had tiny roman numerals embedded in its rim.
It was a pancake clock. They had ’em in those days,
always getting smaller, which is why they finally became extinct.   
It was a hundred years before anyone noticed.
                                                                     The governor general
called it “sinuous.” But we, we had other names for it,   
knew it was going to be around for a long time,
even though extinct. And sure as shillelaghs fall from trees   
onto frozen doorsteps, it came round again
when all memory of it had been expunged
                                                            from the common brain.
Everybody wants to try one of those new pancake clocks.   
A boyfriend in the next town had one
but conveniently forgot to bring it over each time we invited him.   
Finally the rumors grew more fabulous than the real thing:   
I hear they are encrusted with tangles of briar rose,
                                                                                 so dense
not even a prince seeking the Sleeping Beauty could get inside.   
What’s more, there are more of them than when they were extinct,
yet the prices keep on rising. They have them in the Hesperides   
and in shantytowns on the edge of the known world,   
blue with cold. All downtowns used to feature them.
                                                                              Camera obscuras,
too, were big that year. But why is it that with so many people
who want to know what a shout is about, nobody can find the original recipe?
All too soon, no one cares. We go back to doing little things for each other,
pasting stamps together to form a tiny train track, and other,
less noticeable things. And the past is forgotten till next time.
How to describe the years? Some were like blocks of the palest halvah,
careless of being touched. Some took each others’ trash out,   
put each other’s eyes out. So many got thrown out
before anyone noticed, that it was like a chiaroscuro
                                                                                 of collapsing clouds.
How I longed to visit you again in that old house! But you were deaf,   
or dead. Our letters crossed. A motorboat was ferrying me out past   
the reef, people on shore looked like dolls fingering stuffs.
                                                                                             More
keeps coming out, about the dogs I mean. Surely a simple embrace
from an itinerant fish would have been spurned at certain periods. Not now.
There is a famine of years in the land, the women are beautiful,   
but prematurely old and worn. It doesn’t get better. Rocks half-buried   
in bands of sand, and spontaneous execrations.
                                                                      I yell to the ship’s front door,
wanting to be taller, and somewhere in the middle all this gets lost.   
I was a phantom for a day. My friends carried me around with them. 
It always turns out that much is salvageable.
                                                                     Chicken coops
haven’t floated away on the flood. Lacemakers are back in business   
with a vengeance. All the locksmiths had left town during the night.   
It happened to be a beautiful time of season, spring or fall,   
the air was digestible, the fish tied in love-knots
on their gurneys. Yes, and journeys 
were palpable too: Someone had spoken of saving appearances   
and the walls were just a little too blue in mid-morning.   
Was there ever such a time? I’d like to handle you,
bruise you with kisses for it, yet something always stops me short:   
the knowledge that this isn‘t history,
                                                          no matter how many
times we keep mistaking it for the present, that headlines
trumpet each day. But behind the unsightly school building, now a pickle
warehouse, the true nature of things is known, is not overrided:   
Yours is a vote like any other. And there is fraud at the ballot boxes,
stuffed with lace valentines and fortunes from automatic scales,   
dispensed with a lofty kind of charity, as though this could matter   
to us, these tunes
                            carried by the wind
from a barrel organ several leagues away. No, this is not the time   
to reveal your deception to us. Wait till rain and old age   
have softened us up a little more.
                                                    Then we’ll see how extinct
the various races have become, how the years stand up   
to their descriptions, no matter how misleading,
and how long the disbanded armies stay around. I must congratulate you   
on your detective work, for I am a connoisseur
of close embroidery, though I don’t have a diploma to show for it. 
The trees, the barren trees, have been described more than once.   
Always they are taller, it seems, and the river passes them   
without noticing. We, too, are taller,
our ceilings higher, our walls more tinctured
with telling frescoes, our dooryards both airier and vaguer,
according as time passes and weaves its minute deceptions in and out,   
a secret thread.
Peace is a full stop.
And though we had some chance of slipping past the blockade,   
now only time will consent to have anything to do with us,   
for what purposes we do not know.

Heraldry and all its lovely language;   
I chose my time there learning
elsewhere, where else than land,    Landscape, and how to live, in it
is not like, nothing is like, the colors
or the snow, it is not like pearl and   
it is not like the glitter of rainwater
that darkens the bark against which
the occasional bloom-laden branch
might be seen shedding petals. No.
Here is the past: One was once a boy
and read books and could not pronounce
the most engaging words and read
in silence under blankets. Here   
one was not like oneself or was
quiet and wrong and did not know
the words nor how to ask, who
to ask. Nor why. Boy’s books with flags.
Everyone’s born to the language; anyone
can say something. For instance,    knight banneret, that’s what she called him,   
having no use for him after history,   
she thrust him into the operatic night:    
                                        A woman’s hand rose
above the surface of the lake and caught   
the glistering sword, and slowly   
descended into the boy’s refuge,   
his astonishment, so foreign, so little like home Knights Baronets—inferior barons formed
by James I in 1611, the titles were sold
and the funds went toward the plantation of Ulster.
For this one would receive the right   
to a Field argent, a sinister hand
couped the wrist gules.  
                                           How foreign she was   
when God still cared. This is like a life,   
like a history built fluently, as if
on the innocent, Boy-books and children’s   
crusades: The Reading (al-Korân) versus The Writing (Scripture).
Isn’t it interesting, east / west, us / them?   
Everyone’s born to something.    
                         You should have feared
the flick of my uncle’s thick wrist and
the boat rides when he took me in those days,   
salt water in the bay and hard slaps against the hull,   
back from a day of horizons, of shrimp nets,   
I would lie on the bow feeling anger against
my whole boy’s body as the engines uttered   
their single syllable for twenty miles back to land,   
a whine more terrible than laughter. 
The oral tradition, a voice hard and horrifying.
One might have been a chevalier. Like someone from the books, was she
beautiful? Was your mother lovely   
and a kind of landscape herself, like snow
in dark woods, not like anything else?

Blindfold I should to Myra run,And swear to love her ever;Yet when the bandage was undone,Should only think her clever.

Days of the ferret, a sweet fever.
Someone is walking through the sun
With my tongue on a leash. 
Say “Ahhh.” Thank goodness,
It’s not diabetes or the Bolivian Rot. 
This morning I am a cross
Between lefthandedness
And pointblank rage. 
The sun leaks like soft ice.
The infection deepens . . . 
My eyes dissolve
In a closet of heat.
I become 4,000
Yellow flowers, chirruping. 
O the cliché of a trek into the bowels of China.
O the night that zings like a harpsichord factory!
O gorgeous sun limping in the frozen dusk.
O candy wrappers stacked like bricks! 
Snow growls on my roof.
The infection deepens . . . 
A day on fire
Placing real rabbits
Where my mouth should be. 
I am several kinds of tigers.
I am a confectionary treat. 
This fever fills my sleeves
With pearls of honey drops.
Am I too strange to bleed? 
I’m behind myself
With a knife and fork,
Revolving on a skewer. 
I am wild with grief
As greasy children
Reach deep into my fever
To scoop out their revenge
In double-dips . . . 
Come off it, kids.
Next week, I’ll be raining
On the iron road to Malta
And perfect health, melting
Like sugar in the mouth of the Orinoco.

I go to the mountain side
of the house to cut saplings,
and clear a view to snow
on the mountain. But when I look up,
saw in hand, I see a nest clutched in
the uppermost branches.
I don’t cut that one.
I don’t cut the others either.
Suddenly, in every tree,   
an unseen nest
where a mountain   
would be.

(Kamo-no-Chomei, born at Kamo 1154, died at Toyama on Mount Hino, 24th June 1216) 
 



Swirl sleeping in the waterfall!
On motionless pools scum appearing
                     disappearing! 
Eaves formal on the zenith,
lofty city Kyoto,
wealthy, without antiquities! 
Housebreakers clamber about,
builders raising floor upon floor
at the corner sites, replacing
gardens by bungalows. 
In the town where I was known
the young men stare at me.
A few faces I know remain. 
Whence comes man at his birth? or where
does death lead him? Whom do you mourn?
Whose steps wake your delight?
Dewy hibiscus dries: though dew
outlast the petals. 
I have been noting events forty years. 
On the twentyseventh May eleven hundred
and seventyseven, eight p.m., fire broke out
at the corner of Tomi and Higuchi streets.
In a night
palace, ministries, university, parliament
were destroyed. As the wind veered
flames spread out in the shape of an open fan.
Tongues torn by gusts stretched and leapt.
In the sky clouds of cinders lit red with the blaze.
Some choked, some burned, some barely escaped.
Sixteen great officials lost houses and
very many poor. A third of the city burned;
several thousands died; and of beasts,
limitless numbers. 
Men are fools to invest in real estate. 
Three years less three days later a wind
starting near the outer boulevard
broke a path a quarter mile across
to Sixth Avenue.
Not a house stood. Some were felled whole,
some in splinters; some had left
great beams upright in the ground
and round about
lay rooves scattered where the wind flung them.
Flocks of furniture in the air,
everything flat fluttered like dead leaves.
A dust like fog or smoke,
you could hear nothing for the roar,
                      bufera infernal!
Lamed some, wounded some.
This cyclone turned southwest. 
Massacre without cause. 
Portent? 
The same year thunderbolted change of capital,
fixed here, Kyoto, for ages.
Nothing compelled the change nor was it an easy matter
but the grumbling was disproportionate.
We moved, those with jobs
or wanting jobs or hangers on of the rest,
in haste haste fretting to be the first.
Rooftrees overhanging empty rooms;
dismounted: floating down the river.
The soil returned to heath. 
I visited the new site narrow and too uneven,
cliffs and marshes, deafening shores, perpetual strong winds;
the palace a logcabin dumped amongst the hills
(yet not altogether inelegant).
There was no flat place for houses, many vacant lots,
the former capital wrecked, the new a camp,
and thoughts like clouds changing, frayed by a breath:
peasants bewailing lost land, newcomers aghast at prices.
No one in uniform: the crowds
resembled demobilized conscripts. 
There were murmurs. Time defined them.
In the winter the decree was rescinded,
we returned to Kyoto;
but the houses were gone and none
could afford to rebuild them. 
I have heard of a time when kings beneath bark rooves
watched chimneys.
When smoke was scarce, taxes were remitted. 
To appreciate present conditions
collate them with those of antiquity. 
Drought, floods, and a dearth. Two fruitless autumns.
Empty markets, swarms of beggars. Jewels
sold for a handful of rice. Dead stank
on the curb, lay so thick on
Riverside Drive a car couldnt pass.
The pest bred.
That winter my fuel was the walls of my own house. 
Fathers fed their children and died,
babies died sucking the dead.
The priest Hoshi went about marking their foreheads
A, Amida, their requiem;
he counted them in the East End in the last two months,
fortythree thousand A’s. 
Crack, rush, ye mountains, bury your rills!
Spread your green glass, ocean, over the meadows!
Scream, avalanche, boulders amok, strangle the dale!
O ships in the sea’s power, O horses
On shifting roads, in the earth’s power, without hoofhold!
This is the earthquake, this was
the great earthquake of Genryaku! 
The chapel fell, the abbey, the minster and the small shrines
fell, their dust rose and a thunder of houses falling.
O to be birds and fly or dragons and ride on a cloud!
The earthquake, the great earthquake of Genryaku! 
A child building a mud house against a high wall:
I saw him crushed suddenly, his eyes hung
from their orbits like two tassels.
His father howled shamelessly—an officer.
I was not abashed at his crying. 
Such shocks continued three weeks; then lessening,
but still a score daily as big as an average earthquake;
then fewer, alternate days, a tertian ague of tremors.
There is no record of any greater.
It caused a religious revival.
Months ...
Years ...
...........
Nobody mentions it now. 
This is the unstable world and
we in it unstable and our houses. 
A poor man living amongst the rich
gives no rowdy parties, doesnt sing.
Dare he keep his child at home, keep a dog?
He dare not pity himself above a whimper. 
But he visits, he flatters, he is put in his place,
he remembers the patch on his trousers.
His wife and sons despise him for being poor.
He has no peace. 
If he lives in an alley of rotting frame houses
he dreads a fire.
If he commutes he loses his time
and leaves his house daily to be plundered by gunmen.
The bureaucrats are avaricious.
He who has no relatives in the Inland Revenue,
poor devil! 
Whoever helps him enslaves him
and follows him crying out: Gratitude!
If he wants success he is wretched.
If he doesnt he passes for mad. 
Where shall I settle, what trade choose
that the mind may practise, the body rest? 
My grandmother left me a house
but I was always away
for my health and because I was alone there.
When I was thirty I couldnt stand it any longer,
I built a house to suit myself:
one bamboo room, you would have thought it a cartshed,
poor shelter from snow or wind.
It stood on the flood plain. And that quarter
is also flooded with gangsters. 
One generation
I saddened myself with idealistic philosophies,
but before I was fifty
I perceived there was no time to lose,
left home and conversation.
Among the cloudy mountains of Ohara
spring and autumn, spring and autumn, spring and autumn,
emptier than ever. 
The dew evaporates from my sixty years,
I have built my last house, or hovel,
a hunter’s bivouac, an old
silkworm’s cocoon:
ten feet by ten, seven high: and I,
reckoning it a lodging not a dwelling,
omitted the usual foundation ceremony. 
I have filled the frames with clay,
set hinges at the corners;
easy to take it down and carry it away
when I get bored with this place.
Two barrowloads of junk
and the cost of a man to shove the barrow,
no trouble at all. 
Since I have trodden Hino mountain
noon has beaten through the awning
over my bamboo balcony, evening
shone on Amida.
I have shelved my books above the window,
lute and mandolin near at hand,
piled bracken and a little straw for bedding,
a smooth desk where the light falls, stove for bramblewood.
I have gathered stones, fitted
stones for a cistern, laid bamboo
pipes. No woodstack,
wood enough in the thicket. 
Toyama, snug in the creepers!
Toyama, deep in the dense gully, open
westward whence the dead ride out of Eden
squatting on blue clouds of wistaria.
(Its scent drifts west to Amida.) 
Summer? Cuckoo’s Follow, follow—to
harvest Purgatory hill!
Fall? The nightgrasshopper will
shrill Fickle life!
Snow will thicken on the doorstep,
melt like a drift of sins.
No friend to break silence,
no one will be shocked if I neglect the rite.
There’s a Lent of commandments kept
where there’s no way to break them. 
A ripple of white water after a boat,
shining water after the boats Mansami saw
rowing at daybreak
at Okinoya. Between the maple leaf and the caneflower 
murmurs the afternoon—Po Lo-tien
saying goodbye on the verge of Jinyo river.
(I am playing scales on my mandolin.)
Be limber, my fingers, I am going to play Autumn Wind
to the pines, I am going to play Hastening Brook
to the water. I am no player
but there’s nobody listening,
I do it for my own amusement. 
Sixteen and sixty, I and the gamekeeper’s boy,
one zest and equal, chewing tsubana buds,
one zest and equal, persimmon, pricklypear,
ears of sweetcorn pilfered from Valley Farm. 
The view from the summit: sky bent over Kyoto,
picnic villages, Fushimi and Toba:
a very economical way of enjoying yourself.
Thought runs along the crest, climbs Sumiyama;
beyond Kasatori it visits the great church,
goes on pilgrimage to Ishiyama (no need to foot it!)
or the graves of poets, of Semimaru who said:
                      Somehow or other
                      we scuttle through a lifetime.
                      Somehow or other
                      neither palace nor straw-hut
                      is quite satisfactory.

from Mustapha



O wearisome condition of humanity!
Born under one law, to another bound;
Vainly begot and yet forbidden vanity;
Created sick, commanded to be sound.
What meaneth nature by these diverse laws?
Passion and reason, self-division cause.
Is it the mark or majesty of power
To make offenses that it may forgive?
Nature herself doth her own self deflower
To hate those errors she herself doth give.
For how should man think that he may not do,
If nature did not fail and punish, too?
Tyrant to others, to herself unjust,
Only commands things difficult and hard,
Forbids us all things which it knows is lust,
Makes easy pains, unpossible reward.
If nature did not take delight in blood,
She would have made more easy ways to good.
We that are bound by vows and by promotion,
With pomp of holy sacrifice and rites,
To teach belief in good and still devotion,
To preach of heaven’s wonders and delights;
Yet when each of us in his own heart looks
He finds the God there, far unlike his books.

“A woman for whom great gods might strive!”
   I said, and kissed her there:And then I thought of the other five,
   And of how charms outwear.
I thought of the first with her eating eyes,And I thought of the second with hers, green-gray,And I thought of the third, experienced, wise,And I thought of the fourth who sang all day.
And I thought of the fifth, whom I'd called a jade.
   And I thought of them all, tear-fraught;And that each had shown her a passable maid,
   Yet not of the favour sought.
So I traced these words on the bark of a beech,Just at the falling of the mast:“After scanning five; yes, each and each,I've found the woman desired – at last!”
“–I feel a strange benumbing spell,
   As one ill-wished!” said she.And soon it seemed that something fell
   Was starving her love for me.
“I feel some curse. O, five were there?”And wanly she swerved, and went away.I followed sick: night numbed the air,And dark the mournful moorland lay.
I cried: “O darling, turn your head!”
   But never her face I viewed;“O turn, O turn!” again I said,
   And miserably pursued.
At length I came to a Christ-cross stoneWhich she had passed without discern;And I knelt upon the leaves there strown,And prayed aloud that she might turn.
I rose, and looked; and turn she did;
   I cried, “My heart revives!”“Look more,” she said. I looked as bid;
   Her face was all the five's.
All the five women, clear come back,I saw in her – with her made one,The while she drooped upon the track,And her frail term seemed well-nigh run.
She'd half forgot me in her change;
   “Who are you? Won't you sayWho you may be, you man so strange,
   Following since yesterday?”
I took the composite form she was,And carried her to an arbour small,Not passion-moved, but even becauseIn one I could atone to all.
And there she lies, and there I tend,
   Till my life's threads unwind,A various womanhood in blend –
   Not one, but all combined.

Awake, glad heart! get up and sing!It is the birth-day of thy King.
     Awake! awake!
     The Sun doth shakeLight from his locks, and all the wayBreathing perfumes, doth spice the day.
Awake, awake! hark how th’ wood rings;Winds whisper, and the busy springs
     A concert make;
     Awake! awake!Man is their high-priest, and should riseTo offer up the sacrifice.
I would I were some bird, or star,Flutt’ring in woods, or lifted far
     Above this inn
     And road of sin!Then either star or bird should beShining or singing still to thee.
I would I had in my best partFit rooms for thee! or that my heart
     Were so clean as
     Thy manger was!But I am all filth, and obscene;Yet, if thou wilt, thou canst make clean.
Sweet Jesu! will then. Let no moreThis leper haunt and soil thy door!
     Cure him, ease him,
     O release him!And let once more, by mystic birth,The Lord of life be born in earth.

Her sickness brought me to Connecticut.
Mornings I walk the dog: that part of life
is intact. Who's painted, who's insulated
or put siding on, who's burned the lawn
with lime—that's the news on Ardmore Street. 
The leaves of the neighbor's respectable
rhododendrons curl under in the cold.
He has backed the car
through the white nimbus of its exhaust
and disappeared for the day. 
In the hiatus between mayors
the city has left leaves in the gutters,
and passing cars lift them in maelstroms. 
We pass the house two doors down, the one
with the wildest lights in the neighborhood,
an establishment without irony.
All summer their putto empties a water jar,
their St. Francis feeds the birds.
Now it's angels, festoons, waist-high
candles, and swans pulling sleighs. 
Two hundred miles north I'd let the dog
run among birches and the black shade of pines.
I miss the hills, the woods and stony
streams, where the swish of jacket sleeves
against my sides seems loud, and a crow
caws sleepily at dawn. 
By now the streams must run under a skin
of ice, white air-bubbles passing erratically,
like blood cells through a vein. Soon the mail,
forwarded, will begin to reach me here.

                        Christmas is coming. The goose is getting fat
                        Please put a penny in the old man’s hat.
                        If you haven’t got a penny, a ha’penny will do.
                        If you haven’t got a ha’penny, God bless you.



Tonight the wide, wet flakes of snow
Drift down like Christmas suicides,
Layering the eaves and boughs until
The landscape seems transformed, as from
A night of talk or love. I’ve come
From cankered ports and railroad hubs
To winter in a northern state:
Three months of wind and little light.
Wood split, flue cleaned, and ashes hauled,
I am now proof against the cold
And make a place before the stove.
Mired fast in middle age, possessed
Of staved-in barn and brambled lot,
I think of that fierce-minded woman
Whom I loved, painting in a small,
Unheated room, or of a friend,
Sharp-ribbed from poverty, who framed
And fitted out his house by hand
And writes each night by kerosene.
I think, that is, of others who
Withdrew from commerce and the world
To work for joy instead of gain.
O would that I could gather them
This Yuletide, and shower them with coins.

This seablue fir that rode the mountain storm
Is swaddled here in splints of tin to die.
Sofas around in chubby velvet swarm;
Onlooking cabinets glitter with flat eye;
Here lacquer in the branches runs like rain
And resin of treasure starts from every vein. 
Light is a dancer here and cannot rest.
No tanagers or jays are half so bright
As swarms of fire that deep in fragrance nest
In jungles of the gilt exotic night
Where melons hang like moonstone. White above
Rises that perfect star, the sign of love. 
On carpets’ fairy turf, in rainbow dark,
Here once the enchanted children laid their heads,
Reached for the floating moon above the park,
And all their hopes were simple blues and reds.
Beneath the electric halo, none could see
Swords in the ankle of the victim tree. 
Each named a patron star: Arthur said green
For August in the country; and Betty blue
For swinging and the Florida surf; while Jeanne
Decided gold. One horoscope was true:
The star of Donald low and lava-red—
Enlisted Donald, in Australia dead. 
Our lives were bound to sorcery and night.
Zodiacs crumble on the boughs of rust
For every child is gone. Some burned too bright
And now lie broken in the bins of dust;
And some, a fortunate few, adventured far
And found assurance in the perfect star.

So much I thought was only personal, like poetry,
like caring nothing for Caillebotte the man,
like arriving in Chicago by bus one gray morning
and having no place to go, going to the Art Institute
and the rain outside became nothing
next to the glorious gray of Paris, life-size.
The artist dead and all my life, I thought,
I've liked right things for wrong reasons. 
My sojourn among meticulous dreams
continued. One summer I spent among smart children
taking lessons and abuse from the famous mathematician
who taught old words new: point, line, between.
And the long nights of teaching each other other words,
our fortunate failures. And the furious wind
blew down from time to time among us, hurricanes
which turned live oaks inside out like little minds,
mine, for instance, finding its fervent mode. 
Remember that you, too, could live where men spit
while watching you and your mother pass.
That you want her for yourself alone.
Remember that those men are tall as God at such moments,
more mean. So walk among them, the afternoon cooling
within its limits, the mosquitoes taking
equally from black and white, true and false. 
But there was a peninsula of time I lived on
when our family poverty left me
the couch to sleep on, the great clock
ticking terror through the night. Who can love
through his childhood insomnia? Only rain
could save me–those blessed gray
nights of noise, when sleep, like Ali Baba's
quartered brother, was sewn back together.

When you take the lost road
You come to the snow
And when you find the snow
You get down on your hands and knees
Like a sick dog
That’s been eating the grasses of graveyards
For twenty centuries. 
When you take the lost road
You find woman
Who has no fear of light
Who can kill two cocks at once
Light which has no fear of cocks
And cocks who can’t call in the snow. 
You find lovers who’ve been listening
For the same roosters to sing
For twenty centuries
Roosters that have swallowed stones
Out of each other’s tracks
But have never met
Anywhere on the road. 
When you take the lost road
You find the bright feathers of morning
Laid out in proportion to snow and light
And when the snow gets lost on the road
Then the hot wind might blow from the south   
And there is sadness in bed for twenty centuries
And everyone is chewing the grass on the graves again. 
When you get lost
You come to the moon in the field
The light all lovers soil
The sheet no one leaves clean
The light cocks are afraid to cross
The same moon woman danced under
For twenty centuries
With blood on her face. 
When you get lost on the road
You run into the dead
Who have broken down stones
In their throats for twenty centuries
I saw two little crazy boys crying
Because it was morning
And when morning comes it comes
In the morning and never at night. 
I saw two security police taking out a man’s balls
And I saw two little crazy boys
Crying by the road who wouldn’t go away
But two has never been a number
Because it’s only legal to pass one at a time
It’s only a drum you can carry but you can’t beat
It’s the evidence they need to make you disappear.

Can we believe—by an effort comfort our hearts: it is not waste all this, not placed here in disgust, street after street, each patterned alike, no grace to lighten a single house of the hundred crowded into one garden-space.  Crowded—can we believe, not in utter disgust, in ironical play— but the maker of cities grew faint with the beauty of temple and space before temple, arch upon perfect arch, of pillars and corridors that led out to strange court-yards and porches where sun-light stamped hyacinth-shadows black on the pavement.  That the maker of cities grew faint with the splendour of palaces, paused while the incense-flowers from the incense-trees dropped on the marble-walk, thought anew, fashioned this— street after street alike.  For alas, he had crowded the city so full that men could not grasp beauty, beauty was over them, through them, about them, no crevice unpacked with the honey, rare, measureless.  So he built a new city, ah can we believe, not ironically but for new splendour constructed new people to lift through slow growth to a beauty unrivalled yet— and created new cells, hideous first, hideous now— spread larve across them, not honey but seething life.  And in these dark cells, packed street after street, souls live, hideous yet— O disfigured, defaced, with no trace of the beauty men once held so light.  Can we think a few old cells were left—we are left— grains of honey, old dust of stray pollen dull on our torn wings, we are left to recall the old streets?  Is our task the less sweet that the larvae still sleep in their cells? Or crawl out to attack our frail strength: You are useless. We live. We await great events. We are spread through this earth. We protect our strong race. You are useless. Your cell takes the place of our young future strength.  Though they sleep or wake to torment and wish to displace our old cells— thin rare gold— that their larve grow fat— is our task the less sweet?  Though we wander about, find no honey of flowers in this waste, is our task the less sweet— who recall the old splendour, await the new beauty of cities?  The city is peopled with spirits, not ghosts, O my love:  Though they crowded between and usurped the kiss of my mouth their breath was your gift, their beauty, your life.

Under this Luxemburg of heaven,
upright capstan,
                         small eagles. . . .
is the port of N.Y. . . . .          
gilders, stampers, pen makers, goldbeaters, 
apprehensions of thunder

Tammany, McCoy,

Orangerie and game room
with Old English tall twisted

and Royal Copenhagen porcelain. 
A mutton fat jade
Chien Lung

A technical display.
You bought a perfume bottle
and a Chinese shawl.
Susannah set a headstone in St. Paul. 
I’m inside waiting for a surprise
I’m in love with the girl on the Wabash
I’m alone with a hand in my hand
and a pair of wonderful eyes 
but I’m blue
I have to speak
I want to do
I want to see
the sights obscure me
the facts secure me 
The Maine sails out to sea
the undertaker drives to Hartford 
Yesterday the ducks flew in a mackerel sky.
I had the allotropes of vision,
something historical at the controls
of North America,
heavyweight and metaphorical. 
What are the facts?
they swept the city hall today
they set the lathe dogs
trimmed the tool posts
scraped the bearings
shellacked the knots,
they set the capital
upon the shaft. 
Somebody has to drive the spikes
pitch the gears
oil the cams
somebody has to kill the whisky
somebody has to speak 
What are the facts?   2 
Inland is
the goat in open field.
The milk is marketed.
Attend our table. 
The sand
             and fluorspar
and the soda ash
make a blue
                  aventurine glass
for this city,
                      a lion rampant
on his hind feet, royally
clawing, tail whipped up.   3 
come, great city,
give us that old-time vaudeville 
”During the water-movement
of the French horns
and the lovelace of a violin
a wire from my girl,
`I love you but I need a deposit.‘
Even the ventriloquist’s dummy laughed
after we combed his pretty red hair
and set him on his tricycle.“ 
Do you know the story of Sal?
She was a lonely little gal
with the lovelight in her eyes
and Mr. H. H. at the ivories
and she was happy (honest to God) 
In the season of Romain effects
and synthetic American lights
she drove into a California suburb
in a high-compression gull-line Suiza
rolling her Klieg eyes
like revolving doors 
whereupon the jackass
full of animal gas
floated blissfully
into the dance
of the seven veils,
yakking, ‘I have that
funny feeling again,
it must be love.’ 
Commentary: nothing

Question:
Could you stand an old man
to a cup of coffee?
It’s hard walking
with this silver plate

Come, great city,
                           you have full powers
of attorney to protect your friends.

Immigrants from Warsaw
move into a furnished room
close to the stores
under St. Chrysostom’s carillon
with a porcelain pitcher
and bath and hand towels
on the bed rails.
A new sign appears
in the ground-floor window: Smocking, Hemstitching, Rhinestone Setting 
Our hour from here
                            a loggia
above the pepper trees
a tiny cascade and vines
above the bath house
men and women driving
on the fairway, laughing 
surrounded by Galloway
pottery, garden furniture
and white daisies.

When the light sprang from the sea, blowing,
the window sintered and blew like Venus
revealing my tenderness
                                    and many minds
the way a night shot
discovers a beast drinking
and my responsibilities
                                    eating me
as dogs eat gizzard. 
I saw the city
                      changed
set up like laboratory glassware,
amines of herring brine,
the malic acid of the sea buckthorn,
glass-enclosed prescription balance,
steel and agate, Fabrik Koln
a physics clear as alcohol,
La Vita Nuova, I hardly knew. 
Creditors dined at the Cliquot Club,
they read the papers, trade changed.
Their horses died, the big-bellied;
their dogs slept in the steam heat. 
An ambulance with modest
glass doors and a silver cross
keeps night watch: 
                            A surgeon.
Delicate nickel-plated
instruments are laid on trays. 
Illuminated on the operating table
                            naked glassblowers,
gunsmiths, barbers, clerks, importers,
old men from hotels, pink and tailored,
naphtha-smelling Irish priests,
cravat-and-boy face of the movie usher,
Frankel, Shmulik, Old Country watchmakers 
then a white horse in the park,
cigars and politics.
The city wrapped in cellophane,
an act-born eggshape
                               twisted like Ugolino 
one sea-water,
                      one circulatory system
of man observing his magnificent urea.

I. The Day Dreamers 
All day all over the city every person
Wanders a different city, sealed intact
And haunted as the abandoned subway stations   
Under the city. Where is my alley doorway? 
Stone gable, brick escarpment, cliffs of crystal.   
Where is my terraced street above the harbor,   
Café and hidden workshop, house of love?
Webbed vault, tiled blackness. Where is my park, the path 
Through conifers, my iron bench, a shiver   
Of ivy and margin birch above the traffic?   
A voice. There is a mountain and a wood
Between us—

^^EOP^^

You said: “I’ll go to another country, go to another shore,
find another city better than this one.
Whatever I try to do is fated to turn out wrong
and my heart lies buried like something dead.
How long can I let my mind moulder in this place?
Wherever I turn, wherever I look,
I see the black ruins of my life, here,
where I’ve spent so many years, wasted them, destroyed them totally.” 
You won’t find a new country, won’t find another shore.
This city will always pursue you.
You’ll walk the same streets, grow old
in the same neighborhoods, turn gray in these same houses.
You’ll always end up in this city. Don’t hope for things elsewhere:
there’s no ship for you, there’s no road.
Now that you’ve wasted your life here, in this small corner,
you’ve destroyed it everywhere in the world.


^^EOP^^

Who will honor the city without a name
If so many are dead and others pan gold
Or sell arms in faraway countries? 
What shepherd's horn swathed in the bark of birch
Will sound in the Ponary Hills the memory of the absent—
Vagabonds, Pathfinders, brethren of a dissolved lodge? 
This spring, in a desert, beyond a campsite flagpole,
—In silence that stretched to the solid rock of yellow and red mountains—
I heard in a gray bush the buzzing of wild bees. 
The current carried an echo and the timber of rafts.
A man in a visored cap and a woman in a kerchief
Pushed hard with their four hands at a heavy steering oar. 
In the library, below a tower painted with the signs of the zodiac,
Kontrym would take a whiff from his snuffbox and smile
For despite Metternich all was not yet lost. 
And on crooked lanes down the middle of a sandy highway
Jewish carts went their way while a black grouse hooted
Standing on a cuirassier's helmet, a relict of La Grande Armée.  2
In Death Valley I thought about styles of hairdo,
About a hand that shifted spotlights at the Student's Ball
In the city from which no voice could reach me.
Minerals did not sound the last trumpet.
There was only the rustle of a loosened grain of lava. 
In Death Valley salt gleams from a dried-up lake bed.
Defend, defend yourself, says the tick-tock of the blood.
From the futility of solid rock, no wisdom. 
In Death Valley no hawk or eagle against the sky.
The prediction of a Gypsy woman has come true.
In a lane under an arcade, then, I was reading a poem
Of someone who had lived next door, entitled "An Hour of Thought." 
I looked long at the rearview mirror: there, the one man
Within three miles, an Indian, was walking a bicycle uphill.  3
With flutes, with torches
And a drum, boom, boom,
Look, the one who died in Istanbul, there, in the first row.
He walks arm in arm with his young lady,
And over them swallows fly. 
They carry oars or staffs garlanded with leaves
And bunches of flowers from the shores of the Green Lakes,
As they came closer and closer, down Castle Street.
And then suddenly nothing, only a white puff of cloud
Over the Humanities Student Club,
Division of Creative Writing.  4
Books, we have written a whole library of them.
Lands, we have visited a great many of them.
Battles, we have lost a number of them.
Till we are no more, we and our Maryla.  5
Understanding and pity,
We value them highly.
What else? 
Beauty and kisses,
Fame and its prizes,
Who cares? 
Doctors and lawyers,
Well-turned-out majors,
Six feet of earth. 
Rings, furs, and lashes,
Glances at Masses,
Rest in peace. 
Sweet twin breasts, good night.
Sleep through to the light,
Without spiders.  6
The sun goes down above the Zealous Lithuanian Lodge
And kindles fire on landscapes "made from nature":
The Wilia winding among pines; black honey of the Żejmiana;
The Mereczanka washes berries near the Żegaryno village.
The valets had already brought in Theban candelabra
And pulled curtains, one after the other, slowly,
While, thinking I entered first, taking off my gloves,
I saw that all the eyes were fixed on me.  7
When I got rid of grieving
And the glory I was seeking,
Which I had no business doing, 
I was carried by dragons
Over countries, bays, and mountains,
By fate, or by what happens. 
Oh yes, I wanted to be me.
I toasted mirrors weepily
And learned my own stupidity. 
From nails, mucous membrane,
Lungs, liver, bowels, and spleen
Whose house is made? Mine. 
So what else is new?
I am not my own friend.
Time cuts me in two. 
Monuments covered with snow,
Accept my gift. I wandered;
And where, I don't know.  8
Absent, burning, acrid, salty, sharp.
Thus the feast of Insubstantiality.
Under a gathering of clouds anywhere.
In a bay, on a plateau, in a dry arroyo.
No density. No harness of stone.
Even the Summa thins into straw and smoke.
And the angelic choirs fly over in a pomegranate seed
Sounding every few instants, not for us, their trumpets.  9
Light, universal, and yet it keeps changing.
For I love the light too, perhaps the light only.
Yet what is too dazzling and too high is not for me.
So when the clouds turn rosy, I think of light that is level
In the lands of birch and pine coated with crispy lichen,
Late in autumn, under the hoarfrost when the last milk caps
Rot under the firs and the hounds' barking echoes,
And jackdaws wheel over the tower of a Basilian church.  10
Unexpressed, untold.
But how?
The shortness of life,
the years quicker and quicker,
not remembering whether it happened in this or that autumn.
Retinues of homespun velveteen skirts,
giggles above a railing, pigtails askew,
sittings on chamberpots upstairs
when the sledge jingles under the columns of the porch
just before the moustachioed ones in wolf fur enter.
Female humanity,
children's snots, legs spread apart,
snarled hair, the milk boiling over,
stench, shit frozen into clods.
And those centuries,
conceiving in the herring smell of the middle of the night
instead of playing something like a game of chess
or dancing an intellectual ballet.
And palisades,
and pregnant sheep,
and   pigs, fast eaters and poor eaters,
and cows cured by incantations.  11
Not the Last Judgment, just a kermess by a river.
Small whistles, clay chickens, candied hearts.
So we trudged through the slush of melting snow
To buy bagels from the district of Smorgonie. 
A fortune-teller hawking: "Your destiny, your planets."
And a toy devil bobbing in a tube of crimson brine.
Another, a rubber one, expired in the air squeaking,
By the stand where you bought stories of King Otto and Melusine.  12
Why should that city, defenseless and pure as the wedding necklace of
a forgotten tribe, keep offering itself to me?
Like blue and red-brown seeds beaded in Tuzigoot in the copper desert
seven centuries ago. 
Where ocher rubbed into stone still waits for the brow and cheekbone
it would adorn, though for all that time there has been no one. 
What evil in me, what pity has made me deserve this offering? 
It stands before me, ready, not even the smoke from one chimney is
lacking, not one echo, when I step across the rivers that separate us. 
Perhaps Anna and Dora Drużyno have called to me, three hundred miles
inside Arizona, because except fo me no one else knows that they ever
lived. 
They trot before me on Embankment Street, two hently born parakeets
from Samogitia, and at night they unravel their spinster tresses of gray
hair. 
Here there is no earlier and no later; the seasons of the year and of the
day are simultaneous. 
At dawn shit-wagons leave town in long rows and municipal employees
at the gate collect the turnpike toll in leather bags. 
Rattling their wheels, "Courier" and "Speedy" move against the current
to Werki, and an oarsman shot down over England skiffs past, spread-
eagled by his oars. 
At St. Peter and Paul's the angels lower their thick eyelids in a smile
over a nun who has indecent thoughts. 
Bearded, in a wig, Mrs. Sora Klok sits at the counter, instructing her
twelve shopgirls. 
And all of German Street tosses into the air unfurled bolts of fabric,
preparing itself for death and the conquest of Jerusalem. 
Black and princely, an underground river knocks at cellars of the
cathedral under the tomb of St. Casimir the Young and under the
half-charred oak logs in the hearth. 
Carrying her servant's-basket on her shoulder, Barbara, dressed in
mourning, returns from the Lithuanian Mass at St. Nicholas to the
Romers' house in Bakszta Street. 
How it glitters! the snow on Three Crosses Hill and Bekiesz Hill, not
to be melted by the breath of these brief lives. 
And what do I know now, when I turn into Arsenal Street and open
my eyes once more on a useless end of the world? 
I was running, as the silks rustled, through room after room without
stopping, for I believed in the existence of a last door. 
But the shape of lips and an apple and a flower pinned to a dress were
all that one was permitted to know and take away. 
The Earth, neither compassionate nor evil, neither beautiful nor atro-
cious, persisted, innocent, open to pain and desire. 
And the gift was useless, if, later on, in the flarings of distant nights,
there was not less bitterness but more. 
If I cannot so exhaust my life and their life that the bygone crying is
transformed, at last, into harmony. 
Like a Noble Jan Dęboróg in the Straszun's secondhand-book shop, I am
put to rest forever between two familiar names. 
The castle tower above the leafy tumulus grows small and there is still
a hardly audible—is it Mozart's Requiem?—music. 
In the immobile light I move my lips and perhaps I am even glad not
to find the desired word.   Berkeley, 1968


^^EOP^^

He gossips like my grandmother, this man
with my face, and I could stand
amused all afternoon
in the Hon Kee Grocery,
amid hanging meats he
chops: roast pork cut
from a hog hung
by nose and shoulders,
her entire skin burnt
crisp, flesh I know
to be sweet,
her shining
face grinning
up at ducks
dangling single file,
each pierced by black
hooks through breast, bill,
and steaming from a hole
stitched shut at the ass.
I step to the counter, recite,
and he, without even slightly
varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue,
scribbles my order on a greasy receipt,
and chops it up quick. 
Such a sorrowful Chinese face,
nomad, Gobi, Northern
in its boniness
clear from the high
warlike forehead
to the sheer edge of the jaw.
He could be my brother, but finer,
and, except for his left forearm, which is engorged,
sinewy from his daily grip and
wield of a two-pound tool,
he's delicate, narrow-
waisted, his frame
so slight a lover, some
rough other
might break it down
its smooth, oily length.
In his light-handed calligraphy
on receipts and in his
moodiness, he is
a Southerner from a river-province;
suited for scholarship, his face poised
above an open book, he’d mumble
his favorite passages.
He could be my grandfather;
come to America to get a Western education
in 1917, but too homesick to study,
he sits in the park all day, reading poems
and writing letters to his mother. 
He lops the head off, chops
the neck of the duck
into six, slits
the body
open, groin
to breast, and drains
the scalding juices,
then quarters the carcass
with two fast hacks of the cleaver,
old blade that has worn
into the surface of the round
foot-thick chop-block
a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel. 
The head, flung from the body, opens
down the middle where the butcher
cleanly halved it between
the eyes, and I
see, foetal-crouched
inside the skull, the homunculus,
gray brain grainy
to eat.
Did this animal, after all, at the moment
its neck broke,
image the way his executioner
shrinks from his own death?
Is this how
I, too, recoil from my day?
See how this shape
hordes itself, see how
little it is.
See its grease on the blade.
Is this how I’ll be found
when judgement is passed, when names
are called, when crimes are tallied?
This is also how I looked before I tore my mother open.
Is this how I presided over my century, is this how
I regarded the murders?
This is also how I prayed.
Was it me in the Other
I prayed to when I prayed?
This too was how I slept, clutching my wife.
Was it me in the other I loved
when I loved another?
The butcher sees me eye this delicacy.
With a finger, he picks it
out of the skull-cradle
and offers it to me.
I take it gingerly between my fingers
and suck it down.
I eat my man. 
The noise the body makes
when the body meets
the soul over the soul’s ocean and penumbra
is the old sound of up-and-down, in-and-out,
a lump of muscle chug-chugging blood
into the ear; a lover’s
heart-shaped tongue;
flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes;
the butcher working
at his block and blade to marry their shapes
by violence and time;
an engine crossing,
re-crossing salt water, hauling
immigrants and the junk
of the poor. These
are the faces I love, the bodies
and scents of bodies
for which I long
in various ways, at various times,
thirteen gathered around the redwood,
happy, talkative, voracious
at day’s end,
eager to eat
four kinds of meat
prepared four different ways,
numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables,
each made by distinct affections
and brought to table by many hands. 
Brothers and sisters by blood and design,
who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes,
we constitute a many-membered
body of love.
In a world of shapes
of my desires, each one here
is a shape of one of my desires, and each
is known to me and dear by virtue
of each one’s unique corruption
of those texts, the face, the body:
that jut jaw
to gnash tendon;
that wide nose to meet the blows
a face like that invites;
those long eyes closing on the seen;
those thick lips
to suck the meat of animals
or recite 300 poems of the T’ang;
these teeth to bite my monosyllables;
these cheekbones to make
those syllables sing the soul.
Puffed or sunken
according to the life,
dark or light according
to the birth, straight
or humped, whole, manqué, quasi, each pleases, verging
on utter grotesquery.
All are beautiful by variety.
The soul too
is a debasement
of a text, but, thus, it
acquires salience, although a
human salience, but
inimitable, and, hence, memorable.
God is the text.
The soul is a corruption
and a mnemonic. 
A bright moment,
I hold up an old head
from the sea and admire the haughty
down-curved mouth
that seems to disdain
all the eyes are blind to,
including me, the eater.
Whole unto itself, complete
without me, yet its
shape complements the shape of my mind.
I take it as text and evidence
of the world’s love for me,
and I feel urged to utterance,
urged to read the body of the world, urged
to say it
in human terms,
my reading a kind of eating, my eating
a kind of reading,
my saying a diminishment, my noise
a love-in-answer.
What is it in me would
devour the world to utter it?
What is it in me will not let
the world be, would eat
not just this fish,
but the one who killed it,
the butcher who cleaned it.
I would eat the way he
squats, the way he
reaches into the plastic tubs
and pulls out a fish, clubs it, takes it
to the sink, guts it, drops it on the weighing pan.
I would eat that thrash
and plunge of the watery body
in the water, that liquid violence
between the man’s hands,
I would eat
the gutless twitching on the scales,
three pounds of dumb
nerve and pulse, I would eat it all
to utter it.
The deaths at the sinks, those bodies prepared
for eating, I would eat,
and the standing deaths
at the counters, in the aisles,
the walking deaths in the streets,
the death-far-from-home, the death-
in-a-strange-land, these Chinatown
deaths, these American deaths.
I would devour this race to sing it,
this race that according to Emerson managed to preserve to a hair
for three or four thousand years
the ugliest features in the world.

For a month now, wandering over the Sierras,   
A poem had been gathering in my mind,   
Details of significance and rhythm,
The way poems do, but still lacking a focus.   
Last night I remembered the date and it all   
Began to grow together and take on purpose.
   We sat up late while Deneb moved over the zenith   
And I told Marie all about Boston, how it looked   
That last terrible week, how hundreds stood weeping   
Impotent in the streets that last midnight.
I told her how those hours changed the lives of thousands,
How America was forever a different place   
Afterwards for many.
                              In the morning
We swam in the cold transparent lake, the blue   
Damsel flies on all the reeds like millions   
Of narrow metallic flowers, and I thought   
Of you behind the grille in Dedham, Vanzetti,
Saying, “Who would ever have thought we would make this history?”
Crossing the brilliant mile-square meadow   
Illuminated with asters and cyclamen,   
The pollen of the lodgepole pines drifting   
With the shifting wind over it and the blue   
And sulphur butterflies drifting with the wind,   
I saw you in the sour prison light, saying,   
“Goodbye comrade.”
                           In the basin under the crest
Where the pines end and the Sierra primrose begins,   
A party of lawyers was shooting at a whiskey bottle.   
The bottle stayed on its rock, nobody could hit it.
Looking back over the peaks and canyons from the last lake,   
The pattern of human beings seemed simpler   
Than the diagonals of water and stone.   
Climbing the chute, up the melting snow and broken rock,
I remembered what you said about Sacco,
How it slipped your mind and you demanded it be read into the record.
Traversing below the ragged arête,
One cheek pressed against the rock
The wind slapping the other,
I saw you both marching in an army
You with the red and black flag, Sacco with the rattlesnake banner.
I kicked steps up the last snow bank and came   
To the indescribably blue and fragrant
Polemonium and the dead sky and the sterile
Crystalline granite and final monolith of the summit.   
These are the things that will last a long time, Vanzetti,
I am glad that once on your day I have stood among them.   
Some day mountains will be named after you and Sacco.   
They will be here and your name with them,
“When these days are but a dim remembering of the time   
When man was wolf to man.”
I think men will be remembering you a long time   
Standing on the mountains
Many men, a long time, comrade.

                           She is a bezel
                           awaiting the plop of a
                           ruby she must grow
                           chronically 
and I can’t end and I can’t lie
here         
               He held him in his own heart then

The last light of a July evening drained
into the streets below: My love and I had hard   
things to say and hear, and we sat over   
wine, faltering, picking our words carefully. 
The afternoon before I had lain across   
my bed and my cat leapt up to lie   
alongside me, purring and slowly   
growing dozy. By this ritual I could 
clear some clutter from my baroque brain.
And into that brief vacancy the image
of a horse cantered, coming straight to me,   
and I knew it brought hard talk and hurt 
and fear. How did we do? A medium job,   
which is well above average. But because   
she had opened her heart to me as far   
as she did, I saw her fierce privacy, 
like a gnarled, luxuriant tree all hung   
with disappointments, and I knew   
that to love her I must love the tree   
and the nothing it cares for me.

C. Damon, come drive thy flocks this way. D. No, ’tis too late; they went astray. C. I have a grassy scutcheon spied,
  Where Flora blazons all her pride. 
  The grass I aim to feast thy sheep: 
  The flowers I for thy temples keep.D. Grass withers; and the flowers too fade.C. Seize the short joys then, ere they vade, 
  Seest thou that unfrequented cave?D. That den?C.           Love’s Shrine.D.                         But virtue’s grave. C. In whose cool bosom we may lie
  Safe from the sun.D.                    Not heaven’s eye.C. Near this, a fountain’s liquid bell 
  Tinkles within the concave shell.D. Might a soul bathe there and be clean, 
  Or slake its drought?C.                      What is’t you mean? D. These once had been enticing things,
  Clorinda, pastures, caves, and springs.C. And what late change?D.                       The other day 
  Pan met me.C.              What did great Pan say?D. Words that transcend poor shepherds’ skill,
  But he e’er since my songs does fill:
  And his name swells my slender oat.C. Sweet must Pan sound in Damon’s note. D. Clorinda’s voice might make it sweet. C. Who would not in Pan’s praises meet?
CHORUS Of Pan the flowery pastures sing, Caves echo, and the fountains ring. Sing then while he doth us inspire; For all the world is our Pan’s choir.

I once hit clothespins   
for the Chicago Cubs.   
I'd go out after supper   
when the wash was in   
and collect clothespins   
from under four stories   
of clothesline.   
A swing-and-a-miss   
was a strike-out;   
the garage roof, Willie Mays,   
pounding his mitt   
under a pop fly.   
Bushes, a double,   
off the fence, triple,   
and over, home run.   
The bleachers roared.   
I was all they ever needed for the flag.   
New records every game—
once, 10 homers in a row!   
But sometimes I'd tag them   
so hard they'd explode,   
legs flying apart in midair,   
pieces spinning crazily   
in all directions.   
Foul Ball! What else   
could I call it?   
The bat was real.   


^^EOP^^

Anemone and columbine
Where gloom has lain
Opened in gardens
Between love and disdain 
Made somber by the sun
Our shadows meet
Until the sun
Is squandered by night 
Gods of living water
Let down their hair
And now you must follow
A craving for shadows


^^EOP^^

The clouds as I see them, rising   
urgently, roseate in the   
mounting of somber power 
surging in evening haste over   
roofs and hermetic   
grim walls— 
                          Last night
as if death had lit a pale light
in your flesh, your flesh
was cold to my touch, or not cold   
but cool, cooling, as if the last traces   
of warmth were still fading in you.
My thigh burned in cold fear where   
yours touched it. 
But I forced to mind my vision of a sky   
close and enclosed, unlike the space in which these clouds move—
a sky of gray mist it appeared—
and how looking intently at it we saw
its gray was not gray but a milky white
in which radiant traces of opal greens,
fiery blues, gleamed, faded, gleamed again,
and how only then, seeing the color in the gray,   
a field sprang into sight, extending
between where we stood and the horizon, 
a field of freshest deep spiring grass   
starred with dandelions,
green and gold
gold and green alternating in closewoven   
chords, madrigal field. 
Is death’s chill that visited our bed   
other than what it seemed, is it   
a gray to be watched keenly? 
Wiping my glasses and leaning westward,   
clearing my mind of the day’s mist and leaning   
into myself to see
the colors of truth 
I watch the clouds as I see them   
in pomp advancing, pursuing   
the fallen sun.


^^EOP^^

It is windy today. A wall of wind crashes against,
windows clunk against, iron frames
as wind swings past broken glass
and seethes, like a frightened cat
in empty spaces of the cellblock. 
In the exercise yard
we sat huddled in our prison jackets,
on our haunches against the fence,
and the wind carried our words
over the fences,
while the vigilant guard on the tower
held his cap at the sudden gust. 
I could see the main tower from where I sat,
and the wind in my face
gave me the feeling I could grasp
the tower like a cornstalk,
and snap it from its roots of rock. 
The wind plays it like a flute,
this hollow shoot of rock.
The brim girded with barbwire
with a guard sitting there also,
listening intently to the sounds
as clouds cover the sun. 
I thought of the day I was coming to prison,
in the back seat of a police car,
hands and ankles chained, the policeman pointed,
    “See that big water tank? The big
    silver one out there, sticking up?
    That’s the prison.” 
And here I am, I cannot believe it.
Sometimes it is such a dream, a dream,
where I stand up in the face of the wind,
like now, it blows at my jacket,
and my eyelids flick a little bit,
while I stare disbelieving. . . . 
The third day of spring,
and four years later, I can tell you,
how a man can endure, how a man
can become so cruel, how he can die
or become so cold. I can tell you this,
I have seen it every day, every day,
and still I am strong enough to love you,
love myself and feel good;
even as the earth shakes and trembles,
and I have not a thing to my name,
I feel as if I have everything, everything.


^^EOP^^

A strong song tows
us, long earsick.
Blind, we follow
rain slant, spray flick
to fields we do not know. 
Night, float us.
Offshore wind, shout,
ask the sea
what’s lost, what’s left,
what horn sunk,
what crown adrift. 
Where we are who knows
of kings who sup
while day fails? Who,
swinging his axe
to fell kings, guesses
where we go?


^^EOP^^

The last few gray sheets of snow are gone,
winter’s scraps and leavings lowered
to a common level. A sudden jolt
of weather pushed us outside, and now
this larger world once again belongs to us.
I stand at the edge of it, beside the house,
listening to the stream we haven’t heard
since fall, and I imagine one day thinking
back to this hour and blaming myself
for my worries, my foolishness, today’s choices
having become the accomplished
facts of change, accepted
or forgotten. The woods are a mangle
of lines, yet delicate, yet precise,
when I take the time to look closely.
If I’m not happy it must be my own fault.
At the edge of the lawn my wife
bends down to uncover a flower, then another.
The first splurge of crocuses.
And for a moment the sweep and shudder
of the wind seems indistinguishable
from the steady furl of water
just beyond her.

Quis consurget mecum adversus malignantes? aut quis stabit mecum adversus operantes iniquitatem? Nemo, Domine!



What can it avail
To drive forth a snail,
Or to make a sail
Of an herring’s tail;
To rhyme or to rail,
To write or to indict,
Either for delight
Or else for despight;
Or books to compile
Of divers manner of style,
Vice to revile
And sin to exile;
To teach or to preach,
As reason will reach?
Say this, and say that,
His head is so fat,
He wotteth never what
Nor whereof he speaketh;
He crieth and he creaketh,
He prieth and he peeketh,
He chides and he chatters,
He prates and he patters,   
He clitters and he clatters,
He meddles and he smatters,
He gloses and he flatters;
Or if he speak plain,
Then he lacketh brain,
He is but a fool;
Let him go to school,
On a three footed stool
That he may down sit,
For he lacketh wit;
And if that he hit
The nail on the head,
It standeth in no stead;
The devil, they say, is dead,
The devil is dead.
    It may well so be,
Or else they would see
Otherwise, and flee
From worldly vanity,
And foul covetousness,
And other wretchedness,
Fickle falseness,
Variableness,
With unstableness.
    And if ye stand in doubt
Who brought this rhyme about,
My name is Colin Clout.
I purpose to shake out
All my connying bag,
Like a clerkly hag;
For though my rhyme be ragged,
Tattered and jagged,
Rudely rain beaten,
Rusty and moth eaten,
If ye take well therewith,
It hath in it some pith.

To think I might have been dead,
he said to himself, ashamed, as if this were
a curse of the heart, raising a bundle of bones
to a man’s height. As if it were suddenly
forbidden to touch even words that had dropped to the ground.
Besides, he was afraid of finding
his body in a metal press. Embarrassing
down to the capillaries. 
the tram stood jammed above him
like an icebreaker’s prow and all that was left of the car
was a grotesque pretzel with a chunk bitten off
by the dentures of a demented angel.
Something dark was dripping on the rails,
and a strikingly pale wind was leafing
through a book still warm. 
People were forming a circle and with deaf-mute
sympathy awaited the play’s catharsis,
like maggots emerging from
under the wings of a beheaded chicken.
From afar came the approaching wail of sirens,
congealing in the jinxed air-conditioning of that day
and that minute. Dewdrops were falling
on the back of the neck like remnants of
atmospheric dignity. Embarrassing down to the capillaries. 
No, thank you, he said, I’ll wait;
for a silent film had started to run
without subtitles, without colour and without answers. 
       And what about the magnetic monopoles
escaping seconds after the Big Bang,
protons violating the irreversibility of the flow of time? 
       What about the giant molecular clouds
under the galaxy’s shoulders, conceiving
the embryos of stars? 
    What about the loneliness of the first genes
accumulating amino acids in shallow primeval pools
at the expense of entropic usurers? 
      What about the desiccated starfish
like proto-eagles’ talons dug into the bed
of a vanishing sea? 
       What about the mortal migrations of birds
observing the sun’s inclination
and the roar of sex hormones? 
       What about the caged half-crazed
orang-utan who vomits because
he has nothing else to do? 
       What about the mice which for a thousand years
have learned to sing and the frogs balancing
on one leg like the thigh
of a beauty queen from Mesopotamia? 
       What about poetry, an enterprise
so disorderly it twists the rulers
and increases the squint of school inspectors? 
       And what about the little girl
in the leukemia ward who, on the toilet,
tried to show what kind of moustache the kind doctor has,
but as her skinny sticks of hands let go of
the edge of the bowl, she falls in and so
tried again and again? 
       And what about the weak-kneed intellectual,
the professor who understood the approximate universe
but forgot the traffic rules? 
No, thank you, he said to some uniform,
I don’t need anything. My papers are in my pocket
but I can’t reach there. And he tried
to smile a little at this embarrassment of complicated creation.
It’s all my fault, he said,
thank you.
                And then he died.

                    WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD is true. I was in his house. His wife carried
a tray of coffee and sugar. His daughter filed her nails, his son went   
out for the night. There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the
cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its black cord over
the house. On the television was a cop show. It was in English.
Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to
scoop the kneecaps from a man's legs or cut his hands to lace. On
the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had
dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for
calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of
bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief
commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was
some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot
said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed
himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say
nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries
home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like
dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one
of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water
glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As
for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck them-
selves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last
of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said. Some
of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. Some of the
ears on the floor were pressed to the ground.
                                                                                     May 1978

Purple as tulips in May, mauve
into lush velvet, purple
as the stain blackberries leave
on the lips, on the hands,
the purple of ripe grapes
sunlit and warm as flesh. 
Every day I will give you a color,
like a new flower in a bud vase
on your desk. Every day
I will paint you, as women
color each other with henna
on hands and on feet. 
Red as henna, as cinnamon,
as coals after the fire is banked,
the cardinal in the feeder,
the roses tumbling on the arbor
their weight bending the wood
the red of the syrup I make from petals. 
Orange as the perfumed fruit
hanging their globes on the glossy tree,
orange as pumpkins in the field,
orange as butterflyweed and the monarchs
who come to eat it, orange as my
cat running lithe through the high grass. 
Yellow as a goat’s wise and wicked eyes,
yellow as a hill of daffodils,
yellow as dandelions by the highway,
yellow as butter and egg yolks,
yellow as a school bus stopping you,
yellow as a slicker in a downpour. 
Here is my bouquet, here is a sing
song of all the things you make
me think of, here is oblique
praise for the height and depth
of you and the width too.
Here is my box of new crayons at your feet. 
Green as mint jelly, green
as a frog on a lily pad twanging,
the green of cos lettuce upright
about to bolt into opulent towers,
green as Grand Chartreuse in a clear
glass, green as wine bottles. 
Blue as cornflowers, delphiniums,
bachelors’ buttons. Blue as Roquefort,
blue as Saga. Blue as still water.
Blue as the eyes of a Siamese cat.
Blue as shadows on new snow, as a spring
azure sipping from a puddle on the blacktop. 
Cobalt as the midnight sky
when day has gone without a trace
and we lie in each other’s arms
eyes shut and fingers open
and all the colors of the world
pass through our bodies like strings of fire.

I am writing this poem
               about the 1965 massacre
      of Indonesians by Indonesians 
which in an article ten years later
               I could not publish
      except in Nottingham England with 
a friend Malcolm Caldwell who has since
               himself been murdered
      no one will say by whom but I will guess 
seeing as this is
               precisely poetry
      the CIA's and now Peking's Cambodian 
assassins the Khmer Serai
               In that article I estimated
      a half-million or more  killed in this period
               it took Noam in a book
      suppressed by its first publisher 
to quote Admiral Sudomo
               of the Indonesian junta
    more than 500,000 
and now Amnesty International
                many more than one million
      so much for my balanced prose 
But none of us experienced
               that pervasive smell of death
      those impassable rivers 
clogged with corpses
               Robert Lowell is that why
      even you a pacifist 
had so little to say about it?
               Or you gentle reader
      let us examine carefully 
the good reasons
               you and I
      don't enjoy reading this 
Like the time
               in the steep Engadine
      we saw the silent avalanche 
fall away from the mountain
               hair and eyebrows
      the first to feel 
the murmurations
               of the spreading

          a clash between the malignant
   and the ridiculous 
It is not your belief in men
          every last one of them are cultural artifacts
   that I now question 
or even that the imposition
           of meaning on life
   is the major end of human existence 
that Virgilian flourish
          in your footnote to Max Weber
   but your recurring interpretations 
of the Balinese massacre
          after what you choose to call
   the bungled coup and its savage aftermath 
My complaint is not
          of your early field project
   for Ford and the CIA-funded 
Center at MIT
          in which you preceded Pauker
   or your commissioned study 
on which local elites
          would best play a role
   in Rostow's pre-take-off period 
I will not cast that stone
          from this front window
   of the world's largest weapons lab 
you who know about
          puputan and Tjalonarang
   have the right to recall  the fact of the massacre
          through the medium of the cockfight
   the theatricality of trance 
but why did you write
          several hundred thousand
   people were massacred  largely villagers by other villagers
          though there were some
   army executions as well 
when even Shaplen admits
          the murders in Bali
   did not start until early December 
that is until after
          Colonel Edhie's commandos
   with unit-names like Dracula 
had finished in East Java
          the army began it
   then handed the job over to the Balinese 
that is to the special teams
          set up under Nasution's
   and Suharto's orders  and finally stopped the bloodletting
          as the smell of burning houses
   overpowered the customary  fragrance of the rich island flora
          Clifford Geertz sometimes
   the world is not as mysterious 
as you and I might wish
          why can you not write
   as straightforwardly as Time 
about the land to which you returned
          on a junta visa
   and how can you write 
about the integrative revolution
          in a book that is indexed
   to sixty-one countries 
Paraguay the Soviet Union
but not the United States? 
               IV.ix 
When some toys from the West
          where stolen out of the back seat
   of our Peugeot in Saska Kepa 
I went without thinking   
          to the Warsaw police
   A moustached officer 
wrote down everything
          I had to say
   which was very little 
and then asked me
          Was the door locked?
   I said I had no idea 
probably not and he said
          Prosze Pana excuse me
   but it would be good in the future  to keep your doors locked
          Our children are not used
   to seeing toys from the west  and you do not want
          to encourage them in crime
   those Sunday walks with 
Cassie in her blue pram
          the well-dressed housewives
   offering in illegal dollars 
twice what we paid for it
          I told the officer
   I was withdrawing my complaint 
He smiled and began to talk
          about his life as a policeman
   how much easier it had been 
after Stalin had died
          in those days no one
   wanted to talk to us  even our own children
          sometimes mistrusting us
   despite what they learned at school 
We talked for two hours
          and I think of him often
   as I read in the papers 
of Solidarnosc suppressed
          how those must be
   privileged moments 
one can so transcend history
          how today he would not dare
   to have such a conversation 
nor I have the heart
          And yet those two hours
   in that ill-furnished precinct 
seem somehow more true
          than the street battles since
   My own life is easier 
no longer having to be consul
          I suspect that on our side
   officials of U.S. Steel 
             IV.xvii 
And now East Timor
          where in 1977
   the Indonesian minister admits  perhaps 80,000 might have been killed
          that is to say one person out of eight
   by his own government's paracommandos 
these gentle midnight faces
          the beetles which crowd their eyes
   From 1975 to 1977 
the New York Times index
          entries for East Timor
   dropped from six columns

We have done what we wanted.
We have discarded dreams, preferring the heavy industry   
of each other, and we have welcomed grief
and called ruin the impossible habit to break. 
And now we are here.
The dinner is ready and we cannot eat.   
The meat sits in the white lake of its dish.   
The wine waits. 
Coming to this
has its rewards: nothing is promised, nothing is taken away.   
We have no heart or saving grace,
no place to go, no reason to remain.

Old as I am
This candle I light
For you today
May be the last one
Of your afterlife
With me, your son—
With me you die twice.

The time is come, I must depart    from thee, ah famous city; I never yet to rue my smart,    did find that thou had’st pity. Wherefore small cause there is, that I    should grieve from thee to go; But many women foolishly,    like me, and other moe, Do such a fixèd fancy set,    on those which least deserve, That long it is ere wit we get      away from them to swerve. But time with pity oft will tell      to those that will her try, Whether it best be more to mell,    or utterly defy. And now hath time me put in mind    of thy great cruelness, That never once a help would find,    to ease me in distress. Thou never yet would’st credit give    to board me for a year; Nor with apparel me relieve,    except thou payèd were. No, no, thou never did’st me good,    nor ever wilt, I know. Yet am I in no angry mood,    but will, or ere I go, In perfect love and charity,    my testament here write, And leave to thee such treasury,    as I in it recite. Now stand aside and give me leave       to write my latest will; And see that none you do deceive    of that I leave them till.

O happy dames, that may embrace
The fruit of your delight,
Help to bewail the woeful case
And eke the heavy plight
Of me, that wonted to rejoice
The fortune of my pleasant choice;
Good ladies, help to fill my mourning voice. 
In ship, freight with remembrance
Of thoughts and pleasures past,
He sails that hath in governance
My life while it will last;
With scalding sighs, for lack of gale,
Furthering his hope, that is his sail,
Toward me, the sweet port of his avail. 
Alas! how oft in dreams I see
Those eyes that were my food;
Which sometime so delighted me,
That yet they do me good;
Wherewith I wake with his return,
Whose absent flame did make me burn:
But when I find the lack, Lord, how I mourn! 
When other lovers in arms across
Rejoice their chief delight.
Drowned in tears, to mourn my loss
I stand the bitter night
In my window, where I may see
Before the winds how the clouds flee.
Lo! what a mariner love hath made of me! 
And in green waves when the salt flood
Doth rise by rage of wind,
A thousand fancies in that mood
Assail my restless mind.
Alas! now drencheth my sweet foe,
That with the spoil of my heart did go,
And left me; but, alas! why did he so? 
And when the seas wax calm again
To chase fro me annoy,
My doubtful hope doth cause me pain;
So dread cuts off my joy.
Thus is my wealth mingled with woe,
And of each thought a doubt doth grow;
“Now he comes! Will he come? Alas, no, no!”

for my father



Vivid and heavy, he strolls through dark brick kitchens
Within the great house of Esterhazy:
A deaf servant’s candle
Is tipped toward bakers who are quarreling about
The green kindling! The wassail is
Being made by pouring beer and sherry from dusty bottles 
Over thirty baked apples in a large bowl: into
The wassail, young girls empty their aprons of
Cinnamon, ground mace, and allspice berries. A cook adds
Egg whites and brandy. The giant glass snifters
On a silver tray are taken from the kitchen by two maids.
The anxious pianist eats the edges of a fig 
Stuffed with Devonshire cream. In the sinks the gallbladders
Of geese are soaking in cold salted water.
Walking in the storm, this evening, he passed
Children in rags, singing carols; they were roped together
In the drifting snow outside the palace gate.
He knew he would remember those boys’ faces. . . 
There’s a procession into the kitchens: larger boys, each
With a heavy shoe of coal. The pianist sits and looks
Hard at a long black sausage. He will not eat 
Before playing the new sonata. Beside him
The table sags with hams, kidney pies, and two shoulders
Of lamb. A hand rings a bell in the parlor! 
No longer able to hide, he walks
Straight into the large room that blinds him with light.
He sits before the piano still thinking of hulled berries. . .
The simple sonata which 
He is playing has little
To do with what he’s feeling: something larger
Where a viola builds, in air, an infinite staircase.
An oboe joins the viola, they struggle
For a more florid harmony.   
But the silent violins now emerge 
And, like the big wing of a bird, smother everything
In a darkness from which only a single horn escapes—
That feels effaced by the composer’s dream. . .
But he is not dreaming,
The composer is finishing two performances simultaneously! 
He is back in the dark kitchens, sulking and counting
His few florins—they have paid him
With a snuffbox that was pressed
With two diamonds, in Holland!
This century discovers quinine.
And the sketchbooks of a mad, sad musician 
Who threw a lantern at his landlord who was standing beside
A critic. He screamed: Here, take the snuffbox, I’ve filled
It with the dander of dragons!

legato con amore in un volume
ciò che per l’universo si squaderna . . .



If what began (look far and wide) will end:
This lava globe huddle and freeze, its core
Brittle with cold, or pulled too near its friend
Pop once like one gun in a long-drawn war,
And the stars sputter one by one, the night
So empty judging empty’s out of date
(Space and time gone), then only, height on height,
Mind that impelled those currents and that freight,
Mind that after five days (see those days!
Regions all tropic one day, one all ice!)
Whistled man from the sea-moss, saw him raise
The blundering forepaw, blink from shaggy eyes—
If image, likeness in the ox-yoke brow
Long out of focus, focused mind to Mind—
Ah what unspeakable two and two allows
That silence huddle and all eyes go blind?
Our ups and downs—there! that remembered makes
Memory which is the single mind. How sweet
Carmine stars of the maple fumed in rakes
At 1350 such and such a street.
A thing to keep in mind. Yes and keep yet
When the vile essence violescence lies.
Once in winter by the richening sill
Quiet, the fireplace tiny in our eyes—
I mention this; there’s more. The Almighty will
Aeons late stumble on it with surprise.


^^EOP^^

Your joke
Is like a lake
That lies there without any thought
And sees
Dead seas
The birds fly
Around there
Bewildered by its blue without any thought of water
Without any thought
Of water.

for Hank



The General’s men sit at the door. Her eyes
Are fat with belladonna. She’s naked
Except for the small painted turtles
That are drinking a flammable cloud
Of rum and milk from her navel. 
The ships out in the harbor
Are loosely allied
Like casks floating in bilge.
The occasional light on a ship
Winks. In the empty room of the manuscript
Someone is grooming you
For the long entrance into the dark city. 
They’ll hang the General.
Then with torches they’ll search for his children.
Men and women
Are seen jumping from the burning hotel.
Journalists, in no hurry,
Elect to take the elevator. They walk
Out of the building, stepping over corpses. . .
You are listening to loud bells. 
The corpses get up and follow the journalists.
It’s unfair that while rehearsing
For death they actually succumbed to it.
But no one sobs.
Shirts and dresses billowing as they fall.
Something inhuman in you watched it all.
And whatever it is that watches,
It has kept you from loneliness like a mob.

My ghostly fader, I me confess,

Which don was out avisiness—
But it is doon, not undoon, now. 
My ghostly fader, I me confess,
First to God and then to you. 
But I restore it shall, doutless,
Agein, if so be that I mow;
And that to God I make a vow,
And elles I axe foryefness. 
My ghostly fader, I me confesse,
First to God and then to you.

OUR PATRON OF FALLING SHORT,
WHO BECAME A PRAYER  I used to sneak into the movies without paying.   
I watched the stories but I failed to see the dark.
I went to college and drank everything they gave me,   
and I never paid for any of that water
on which I drifted as if by grace until
after the drownings, when in the diamond light
of seven-something A.M., as the spring was tearing   
me up in Cartajena, only praying
on my knees before the magnifying ark
of the Seventh St. Hotel could possibly save me,   
until falling on my face before the daughter   
of money while the world poured from the till
brought the moment’s length against the moment’s height,   
and paying was what I was earning and eating and wearing.   

^^EOP^^

All things belie me, I think, but I
look at them though. Well boys, at
least you’re not dead, right? What’s
the date today? Until something. What?
Of the lady of the whitening blow.
I’m ashamed to keep on babbling
as if I’ve always been oneself,
diamond flow through. Humble
flannel skeleton. Grin, laugh unbecoming
Living at the bottom of the water may
have been obvious all the time. But
I forget. What’s my plot? Hand
of a child, paw of an animal. Paint
it red & make a pawprint in the psalter.
Protect her & give her back her hat
Entangle her dreams in demotic and
Warm her feet; cheat the judge
& protect the tree from which he was carved.  
                                  * 
And now that I’ve explained the situation
Jesus my frame hurts, you say.
Fucking pain. Hey come & empty my ashtray
once more & don’t get so excited. A
gentle heart was broken. Whose? No one’s
It’s a figure like a frame among
medlars & briars. Hand me that piece of
that, just that, yeah. I don’t mean it,
I’ve never meant anything because that’s
not what I do, in the mountains I call home
How can I tell you of my wound? it’s
round & silver & headstrong, it’s
nothing more than temperament born
of a custom involving a circuitous journey
This is all wrong. It rains today, my
son’s singing love songs of this
country, already being ten.  
                                  * 
And if to withstand this nocturnal pollution of the tiny
wanton stars with bent hook clauses of misprision
I’m supposed to sing the melody of an unexpecting part. . .
Hey a pretty honey come a listen to me
while I evening, darling, your messages,
what would you think then? But I
wouldn’t do that. Light surrounded oranges
towels clouds. You don’t think you’re my you.
Not here not you. You still think you’re he. she.
Because I wouldn’t “you” you, would I? I only
“you” some other he. she. I
who write poems. When she writes them,
it’s different. . .A world of words, right?
It’s only my version of The Entertainer
Nothing truly personal, I’m way above that.
I’ve learned about it for a lot of days. I’ve
been to see the doctor & you have to have shots
for it. 17 balls of yarn & a sewing machine.  
                                  * 
No I wouldn’t know why anyone would
want to write like that. I should never
have had to do it. We were used to this
other thing we always know like when we’re
here. And you have this clear head & you’re
seeing things & there they are. You don’t
notice they’re spelled. That’s how you
know you’re alive. I never saw you

Lo! ’t is a gala night    Within the lonesome latter years!   An angel throng, bewinged, bedight    In veils, and drowned in tears,   Sit in a theatre, to see    A play of hopes and fears, While the orchestra breathes fitfully      The music of the spheres.  Mimes, in the form of God on high,      Mutter and mumble low, And hither and thither fly—    Mere puppets they, who come and go   At bidding of vast formless things    That shift the scenery to and fro, Flapping from out their Condor wings    Invisible Wo!  That motley drama—oh, be sure      It shall not be forgot! With its Phantom chased for evermore      By a crowd that seize it not, Through a circle that ever returneth in      To the self-same spot, And much of Madness, and more of Sin,      And Horror the soul of the plot.  But see, amid the mimic rout,    A crawling shape intrude! A blood-red thing that writhes from out      The scenic solitude! It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs   The mimes become its food, And seraphs sob at vermin fangs    In human gore imbued.  Out—out are the lights—out all!      And, over each quivering form, The curtain, a funeral pall,    Comes down with the rush of a storm,   While the angels, all pallid and wan,      Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy, “Man,”      And its hero, the Conqueror Worm.

The man in the yellow hard hat,  the one with the mask  across his nose and mouth,  pulls the lever that turns the great arm of the crane up  and over and sideways  toward the earth; then the wrecking ball  dangles crazily,  so delicately, like a silver fob  loosened from a waistcoat pocket:  shocking to see  the dust fly up and the timber  sail up, then so slowly  down, how the summer air  bristles with a hundred splinters and the smallest is a splintered flame,  for it takes so many lengthening  erratic movements to tear away  what stands between the sidewalk  and the bell tower,  where the pigeons now rise  in grand indignant waves  at such poor timing, such  a deaf ear toward the music;  in this way the silence  between hand and lever is turned  into a ragged and sorely lifted  wing: the wrecking ball lurches  in a narrowing arc until only  the dust resists—the rest  comes down, story by story, and is hauled off in flatbed trucks.  Meanwhile the pedestrians come  and go, now and then glancing  at their accurate watches.  Gradually, the dust  becomes the rose light  of autumn.  But one evening a woman  loses her way as she’s  swept into a passing wave  of commuters and she looks up toward the perfectly  empty rectangle  now hanging between the rutted mud and the sky.  There along the sides  of the adjacent building,  like a set for a simple  elementary school play,  like the gestures of the dead  in her children’s faces,  she sees the flowered paper  of her parents’ bedroom,  the pink stripes leading  up the stairs to the attic,  and the outline of the claw- footed bathtub, font of the lost cathedral of childhood.

I cannot change, as others do,
     Though you unjustly scorn;
   Since that poor swain, that sighs for you
     For you alone was born.
   No, Phyllis, no, your heart to move
     A surer way I’ll try:
   And to revenge my slighted love,Will still love on, will still love on, and die.
      When, kill’d with grief, Amyntas lies;
     And you to mind shall call
   The sighs that now unpitied rise;
     The tears that vainly fall:
   That welcome hour that ends this smart,
     Will then begin your pain;
   For such a faithful, tender heartCan never break, can never break in vain.

Above a coast that lies between two coasts   
Flight 902 turns west towards San Diego.   
Milwaukee falls away. The constant passenger,   
Removed from character and context, resumes   
His California story, gradually ascending,
Reading Farewell, My Lovely for the umpteenth time,   
Like a book above the world, or below the noise.   
I recall some houses halfway in the desert,   
And how dry the trees all seemed, and temporary   
Even the tallest buildings looked, with bungalows   
Decaying in the Santa Ana wind. And finally   
Just how small it was, and mean. Is it nostalgia   
For the limited that makes the days go quickly,   
Tracing out their spirals of diminishing concern?   
Like all the boys who lived on Westland Avenue,   
I learned to follow the trails through the canyon,   
Shoot at birds with a BB gun, and dream of leaving.   
What are books? To me they seemed like mirrors   
Holding up a vision of the social, in which people,   
Beckoning from their inaccessible preserves
Like forgotten toys, afforded glimpses of those
Evanescent worlds that certain minor writers
—Raymond Chandler say, or even Rupert Brooke—
Could visualize somehow, and bring to life again.
And though these worlds were sometimes difficult to see,   
Once having seen them one returned to find the words   
Still there, like a part of the surroundings
Compliant to one’s will. 
                                     Yet these are attitudes,
And each age has its separate store of attitudes,
Its store of tropes—“In Grantchester, in Grantchester!—”
That filter through its dreams and fill its songs.   
Hume tried to show that sympathy alone allows   
“The happiness of strangers” to affect our lives.   
Yet now and then a phrase, echoing in the mind   
Long after its occasion, seems to resurrect   
A world I think I recognize, and never saw.   
For what was there to see? Some houses on a hill   
Next to a small stream? A village filled with people   
I couldn’t understand? Could anyone have seen the   
Transitory sweetness of the Georgians’ England   
And the world before the War, before The Waste Land?   
Years are secrets, and their memories are often   
Stories of a past that no one witnessed, like the   
Fantasies of home one builds to rationalize   
The ordinary way one’s life has gone since then.   
Words seem to crystallize that life in pictures—
In a postcard of a vicarage, or of a canyon   
Wedged between the desert and an endless ocean—
But their clarity is fleeting. I can nearly
See the coast from here, and as I hear the engines   
And the bell chimes, all those images dissolve.   
And then I start to hear the murmur of that   
Constant voice as distant from me as a landscape   
Studied from an airplane: a contingent person   
With a particular mind, and a particular will,   
Descending across a desert, westward over mountains   
And the sparsely peopled scrub beyond the city,   
Pocked with half-filled reservoirs and rudimentary   
Trails with nothing waiting for me at the end
—“And is there honey still for tea?”—
But isolated houses nestled in the hills.

“Man wants but little here below”



Little I ask; my wants are few;
 I only wish a hut of stone,(A very plain brown stone will do,)
 That I may call my own;—And close at hand is such a one,In yonder street that fronts the sun.
Plain food is quite enough for me;
 Three courses are as good as ten;—If Nature can subsist on three,
 Thank Heaven for three. Amen!I always thought cold victual nice;—My choice would be vanilla-ice.
I care not much for gold or land;—
 Give me a mortgage here and there,—Some good bank-stock, some note of hand,
 Or trifling railroad share,—I only ask that Fortune sendA little more than I shall spend.
Honors are silly toys, I know,
 And titles are but empty names;I would, perhaps, be Plenipo,—
 But only near St. James;I’m very sure I should not careTo fill our Gubernator’s chair.
Jewels are baubles; ’t is a sin
 To care for such unfruitful things;—One good-sized diamond in a pin,—
 Some, not so large, in rings,—A ruby, and a pearl, or so,Will do for me;—I laugh at show.
My dame should dress in cheap attire;
 (Good, heavy silks are never dear;)—I own perhaps I might desire
 Some shawls of true Cashmere,—Some marrowy crapes of China silk,Like wrinkled skins on scalded milk.
I would not have the horse I drive
 So fast that folks must stop and stare;An easy gait—two forty-five—
 Suits me; I do not care;—Perhaps, for just a single spurt,Some seconds less would do no hurt.
Of pictures, I should like to own
 Titians and Raphaels three or four,—I love so much their style and tone,
 One Turner, and no more,(A landscape,—foreground golden dirt,—The sunshine painted with a squirt.)
Of books but few,—some fifty score
 For daily use, and bound for wear;The rest upon an upper floor;—
 Some little luxury there Of red morocco’s gilded gleamAnd vellum rich as country cream.
Busts, cameos, gems,—such things as these,
 Which others often show for pride,I value for their power to please,
 And selfish churls deride;—One Stradivarius, I confess,Two Meerschaums, I would fain possess.
Wealth’s wasteful tricks I will not learn,
 Nor ape the glittering upstart fool;—Shall not carved tables serve my turn,
 But all must be of buhl?Give grasping pomp its double share,—I ask but one recumbent chair.
Thus humble let me live and die,
 Nor long for Midas’ golden touch;If Heaven more generous gifts deny,
 I shall not miss them much,—Too grateful for the blessing lentOf simple tastes and mind content!

had no direction to go but up: and this, the shattery road
its surface graining, trickle in late thaw—is nothing amiss?
            —this melt, the sign assures us, natural cycle
                         and whoosh, the water a dream of forgotten white 
past aspens colored in sulfur, they trembled, would
—poor sinners in redemption song—shed their tainted leaves   
I tell you what boy I was, writing lyrics to reflect my passions:
the smell of a bare neck in summer
a thin trail of hairs disappearing below the top button of cut-offs
the lean, arched back of a cyclist straining to ascend a hill 
in the starlight I wandered: streets no better than fields
the cul-de-sacs of suburbia just as treacherous, just as empty 
if wood doves sang in the branches of the acacias, I could not hear them
anyone lost in that same night was lost in another tract 
the air pulsed and dandelion pollen blew from green stalks
                        —that was all   
and yes, someone took me in his car.   and another against the low fence
in the park at the end of our block.   under the willow branches
where gnats made a furious cloud at dawn and chased us away 
I knew how it felt to lie in a patch of marigolds: golden stains
the way morning swarmed a hidden rooftop, the catbirds singing
the feel of ruin upon lips rubbed raw throughout the night 
granite peaks: here, the earth has asserted itself. and the ice asserted
and human intimacies conspired to keep us low and apart 
for an ice age I knew you only as an idea of longing:
a voice in the next yard, whispering through the chink
a vagabond outlined against the sky, among the drying grass   
we journey this day to darkness: the chasm walls lift us on their scaly backs
the glaciers relinquish their secrets: that sound is the ice bowing
and the sound underneath, the trickle: the past released, disappearing   
you pinnacle of my life, stand with me on this brink
half-clouded basin caked in flat grays, the very demise of green 
you have surmounted the craggy boundary between us.   
you open a place for me in earth, receiving my song  
                                 —for Haines Eason

Uncle Johnny died after rigid years of cutting hair in his shop downtown. Toward the end he cut it badly, breathing a whisky scent into the tonic, talc and glossy male curls piling up on the tiled floor. He died shrivelled, a man who seldom spoke, still with that nickname, Johnny, last taciturn hint of a youth who may have been angry, a lover of women, filled and lightened by vast ocean, the sky over America. He spent his time at home, silent, or sometimes in bars, or on the corner by King’s Newsstand with others like himself on sun-baked cement, spitting single words, standing in dark slacks, short-sleeved shirts and suspenders. The tall and narrow-waisted new world had by that time completely rejected suspenders. And after the funeral Mary, his wife, was crying and said to me, "Why is it that the men always die sooner? Do they just give up?" We stood there in the church of our fathers, who explained their own deaths, all death, by an ancient crime. How foolish it would have been to tell you, Mary, something about dioxyribonucleic acid, adaptation of the sexes, effects of the hormones, or social factors, things you’d listen to blankly. Better to say that what we find in ourselves, whatever weakness, we ourselves have put there. Both of us knew enough about men’s weakness. Your question didn’t need an answer: I simply shrugged and silently, without real hope, asked to be absolved from the fault of men: Powers of earth, give me the male strength that we desire, kindly strength, which protects. Don’t make my wife a nurse, helplessly to watch me dying drunk and before her. And do not punish me for pride because I’ve asked to be so strong: to be the last.

After one moment when I bowed my head
And the whole world turned over and came upright,
And I came out where the old road shone white.
I walked the ways and heard what all men said,
Forests of tongues, like autumn leaves unshed,
Being not unlovable but strange and light;
Old riddles and new creeds, not in despite
But softly, as men smile about the dead 
The sages have a hundred maps to give
That trace their crawling cosmos like a tree,
They rattle reason out through many a sieve
That stores the sand and lets the gold go free:
And all these things are less than dust to me
Because my name is Lazarus and I live.

1. 
   Consider the tragic fortitude
of mannikins, the courage it takes
   under casual poses to do
nothing interminably each day. 
   To face unflinching (through sunlit glass
that bars them from it) the rushing surf
   of life within reach where they must stand
marooned on their islands’ plastic turf, 
   and not to cry out: more heroic
than those Romans the lava rain stunned
   to statues—misshaped by the panic
that twisted their limbs, glazed with their pain 
   in black rock—friezes of agony.
You would never know, from the relaxed
   swivel of this woman’s wrist as she
completes a backhand with her racket, 
   that she will never take another
swing, or from her smile that she has stood
   balanced here on one foot all summer
like one of Dante’s damned, and not cracked.   2. 
   ‘Cracked’ is my father’s word for ‘crazy,’
as in ‘You’d have to be cracked to pay
   that much for a pair of shoes.’ He’s not
crazy, but he forgets, and today 
   as we pay out his visit’s hours
strolling on Bloor, he thinks up the same
   questions again minutes after he’s
nodded and smiled at answers to them. 
   Looking for things to look at and not
think, I focus on another grove
   of mummers: headless, their necks poke out
like worms from the smartly turned-over 
   collars of turtlenecks and jackets.
You can tell they’ve also lost their arms
   from the way the sleeves plummet slackly
off their shoulders—although they, ashamed 
   to show the mutilation, act cool
and tuck the cuffs into their pockets.
   I look at my father—hands trembling,
head crazed like china with minute cracks 
   through which years exit invisibly—
and must remind myself his show is
   kinder, the long-running comedy
where he’s played every part, from fresh-faced 
   mooning lover to child-duped parent
to doddering senex: still free now
   (while heart and limbs play their duet)
to do a walk-on, ad lib, bow out. 
   He sweats a little in the sunshine.
Summer stock, lacking the tragic poise
   that freezes these actors in their scene,
we move on towards a shadier place.

When for the thorns with which I long, too long, 
 With many a piercing wound,
 My Saviour’s head have crowned,I seek with garlands to redress that wrong:
 Through every garden, every mead,I gather flowers (my fruits are only flowers),
 Dismantling all the fragrant towers That once adorned my shepherdess’s head. And now when I have summed up all my store,
 Thinking (so I myself deceive)
 So rich a chaplet thence to weaveAs never yet the King of Glory wore: 
 Alas, I find the serpent old
 That, twining in his speckled breast,
 About the flowers disguised does fold,
 With wreaths of fame and interest.Ah, foolish man, that wouldst debase with them, And mortal glory, Heaven’s diadem! But Thou who only couldst the serpent tame, Either his slippery knots at once untie; And disentangle all his winding snare; Or shatter too with him my curious frame, And let these wither, so that he may die, Though set with skill and chosen out with care:That they, while Thou on both their spoils dost tread, May crown thy feet, that could not crown thy head.

I went for a walk over the dunes again this morning
to the sea,
then turned right along
   the surf
                         rounded a naked headland
                         and returned 
   along the inlet shore: 
it was muggy sunny, the wind from the sea steady and high,   
crisp in the running sand,
       some breakthroughs of sun
   but after a bit 
continuous overcast: 
the walk liberating, I was released from forms,   
from the perpendiculars,
      straight lines, blocks, boxes, binds
of thought
into the hues, shadings, rises, flowing bends and blends   
               of sight: 
                         I allow myself eddies of meaning:   
yield to a direction of significance
running
like a stream through the geography of my work:   
   you can find
in my sayings
                         swerves of action
                         like the inlet’s cutting edge:
               there are dunes of motion,
organizations of grass, white sandy paths of remembrance   
in the overall wandering of mirroring mind:
but Overall is beyond me: is the sum of these events
I cannot draw, the ledger I cannot keep, the accounting
beyond the account: 
in nature there are few sharp lines: there are areas of   
primrose
       more or less dispersed;
disorderly orders of bayberry; between the rows
of dunes,
irregular swamps of reeds,
though not reeds alone, but grass, bayberry, yarrow, all ...
predominantly reeds: 
I have reached no conclusions, have erected no boundaries,   
shutting out and shutting in, separating inside
          from outside: I have
          drawn no lines:
          as 
manifold events of sand
change the dune’s shape that will not be the same shape   
tomorrow, 
so I am willing to go along, to accept   
the becoming
thought, to stake off no beginnings or ends, establish   
         no walls: 
by transitions the land falls from grassy dunes to creek   
to undercreek: but there are no lines, though
       change in that transition is clear
       as any sharpness: but “sharpness” spread out,   
allowed to occur over a wider range
than mental lines can keep: 
the moon was full last night: today, low tide was low:   
black shoals of mussels exposed to the risk
of air
and, earlier, of sun,
waved in and out with the waterline, waterline inexact,   
caught always in the event of change:   
       a young mottled gull stood free on the shoals
       and ate
to vomiting: another gull, squawking possession, cracked a crab,   
picked out the entrails, swallowed the soft-shelled legs, a ruddy
turnstone running in to snatch leftover bits: 
risk is full: every living thing in
siege: the demand is life, to keep life: the small
white blacklegged egret, how beautiful, quietly stalks and spears
               the shallows, darts to shore
                            to stab—what? I couldn’t
       see against the black mudflats—a frightened
       fiddler crab? 
               the news to my left over the dunes and
reeds and bayberry clumps was
               fall: thousands of tree swallows
               gathering for flight:
               an order held
               in constant change: a congregation
rich with entropy: nevertheless, separable, noticeable
          as one event,
                      not chaos: preparations for
flight from winter,
cheet, cheet, cheet, cheet, wings rifling the green clumps,
beaks
at the bayberries
    a perception full of wind, flight, curve,
    sound:
    the possibility of rule as the sum of rulelessness:
the “field” of action
with moving, incalculable center: 
in the smaller view, order tight with shape:
blue tiny flowers on a leafless weed: carapace of crab:
snail shell:
            pulsations of order
            in the bellies of minnows: orders swallowed,   
broken down, transferred through membranes
to strengthen larger orders: but in the large view, no
lines or changeless shapes: the working in and out, together   
            and against, of millions of events: this,
                         so that I make
                         no form of
                         formlessness: 
orders as summaries, as outcomes of actions override   
or in some way result, not predictably (seeing me gain   
the top of a dune,
the swallows
could take flight—some other fields of bayberry   
            could enter fall
            berryless) and there is serenity: 
            no arranged terror: no forcing of image, plan,
or thought:
no propaganda, no humbling of reality to precept: 
terror pervades but is not arranged, all possibilities   
of escape open: no route shut, except in   
   the sudden loss of all routes: 
            I see narrow orders, limited tightness, but will   
not run to that easy victory:
            still around the looser, wider forces work:
            I will try
       to fasten into order enlarging grasps of disorder, widening   
scope, but enjoying the freedom that
Scope eludes my grasp, that there is no finality of vision,   
that I have perceived nothing completely,
that tomorrow a new walk is a new walk.

Do not imagine you can abdicate
Auden 



Prologue 
If the sea could dream, and if the sea   
were dreaming now, the dream
would be the usual one: Of the Flesh.   
The letter written in the dream would go   
something like: Forgive me—love, Blue.

    I. The Viewing (A Chorus)  O what, then, did he look like?
                                                   He had a good body.  And how came you to know this?
                                                 His body was naked.  Say the sound of his body.
                                             His body was quiet.  Say again—quiet?
                            He was sleeping.  You are sure of this? Sleeping?
                                                   Inside it, yes. Inside it. 
* 
    II. Pavilion 
Sometimes, a breeze: a canvas   
flap will rise and, inside,   
someone stirs; a bird? a flower? 
One is thinking Should there be
thirst, I have only to reach   
for the swollen bag of skin 
beside me, I have only to touch
my mouth that is meant for a flower   
to it, and drink.

shepherdboy?   not the most salient image for contemporary readers nor most available.   unless you’re thinking brokeback mountain: a reference already escaping.   I did love a montana man, though no       good shepherd  rather: a caveman, came spelunking into that grotto I’d retreated to  what light he bore illumined such small space—physically, temporally  and did he have a grove of beech trees?   no, no grove but together we found an old-growth stand of   redwood  we gouged each other’s chests instead of wood:   pledges that faded he was not cruel nor I unwitting.   but what endures beyond any       thicket?   example: he took me to the ocean to say farewell.   I mean me: farewell       to ocean the ocean, for that matter, to me.   us both fatigued, showing signs       of wreckage  and that man I had loved stood back from the edge of things  he did not hold me  I expected not to be held  we all understood one another: shepherd understudy, ocean, me   and did he go back to his fields and caves?   yes, but they were gone strip-mining, lumber, defoliant, sterile streams: you knew that was       coming  weren’t we taught some starched sermon: the pasture awaits us       elsewhere   back up a moment: the forest you mentioned—remember, instead of a grove?  untouched for the most part.   some human damage, but not ours  we left no mark, not there in the midst of those great trees:    not in the concentric rings that might have held us far past living  instead, I put that man, like so many others, on paper— a tree already gone from sight where once it had drawn the eyes upward: the crest of a mountain.   crumpled thoughts, crumpled love   shepherdboy, do you see the wild fennel bulbs I gathered for you olallieberries, new-mown grass, the tender fruits of   the coastal fig?  I put them on paper, too, so fragile.   for nothing is ever going to last                                                                                  For Haines Eason

and yet we think that song outlasts us all: wrecked devotion the wept face of desire, a kind of   savage caring that reseeds itself       and grows in clusters  oh, you who are young, consider how quickly the body deranges itself how time, the cruel banker, forecloses us to snowdrifts white       as god’s own ribs   what else but to linger in the slight shade of those sapling branches yearning for that vernal beau.   for don’t birds covet the seeds of the       honey locust and doesn’t the ewe have a nose for wet filaree and slender oats       foraged in the meadow kit foxes crave the blacktailed hare: how this longing grabs me       by the nape   guess I figured to be done with desire, if   I could write it out dispense with any evidence, the way one burns a pile of   twigs       and brush  what was his name?   I’d ask myself, that guy with the sideburns       and charming smile the one I hoped that, as from a sip of   hemlock, I’d expire with him       on my tongue   silly poet, silly man: thought I could master nature like a misguided       preacher as if   banishing love is a fix.   as if the stars go out when we shut our       sleepy eyes                                                                                  For Haines Eason

These lovers’ inklings which our loves enmesh,   
Lost to the cunning and dimensional eye,   
Though tenemented in the selves we see,   
Not more perforce than azure to the sky,   
Were necromancy-juggled to the flesh,   
And startled from no daylight you or me. 
For trance and silvemess those moons commend,   
Which blanch the warm life silver-pale; or look   
What ghostly portent mist distorts from slight   
Clay shapes; the willows that the waters took   
Liquid and brightened in the waters bend,   
And we, in love’s reflex, seemed loved of right. 
Then no more think to net forthwith love’s thing,   
But cast for it by spirit sleight-of-hand;
Then only in the slant glass contemplate,   
Where lineament outstripping line is scanned,   
Then on the perplexed text leave pondering,   
Love’s proverb is set down transliterate.


^^EOP^^

Whom should I consult? Philosophers   
Are happy in their homes and seminars.
See this one with the mischievous bright childlike   
Gaze going out through walls and air,   
A tangent to the bent rays of the star.   
Hear the chalk splutter, hear the groping voice:   
Conceive the demiurge in his perpetual   
Strife with the chaos of the universe,   
That humming equilibrium of creation   
Pure and enormous, crossed by the constant   
Light of unimaginable combustion:   
Teems, how it teems. An elm tree sighs   
Beyond the dusty windowledge of June.   
As in the mind the notes of a melody   
Vibrate when vibration’s gone, a series   
Generated by a decimal has no end;   
Observe it closely, though; it stops when it stops.   
The frail spectacles are bedimmed with spring. 
But whom should I consult? Well-seasoned men,   
Ruddy with business or the salty summer,   
Autumnal in their woolens, gaze
Toward the quick plumes above the city.   
A frosty morning sun reddens the river.   
This one is meditative and well-qualified:   
Decently shined, one heavy saddle-dark   
Perforated brogan swings from the swivel   
Chair arm; leaning back, the head
Well-cropped and grey, the experienced
Eyes quiet, with one highlighted pupil.   
A reader of Herodotus in the evening.   
The road was in receivership, the mills   
Were in receivership, the bondholders   
Suitably informed would not dissent   
From an able plan of reorganization.   
Easy did it.
                   And his beautiful daughters   
Sink in a circle of white skirts like daisies,   
Laughing for the brash photographer.   
Years ago they sailed to the North Cape,   
Made out that flecked mass in the East
With Mother and the broad-shouldered boy from Cook’s
On deck in the dim summer on the grey   
Sea. Often they saw the fishermen
Off Cherbourg in the awe of morning hitting   
The outside spanking seas: red sails in sea-light.   
Far away in the nursery a music box   
Plucks its icy Bavarian tune for them. 
Then whom? A thousand flashes from Long Island   
Enter the high room in the office building,   
A heliograph of cars turning toward sunset.   
Will he decipher them? The journalist   
Sweats in his shirtsleeves, mutilates   
Cigarettes in a smouldering tray, surveys   
Me and the world in a racket of teletypes,   
Sick of it and excited, needing a drink.   
Positive copy sprouts from the typewriter,   
Each paragraph a piston stroke. The sun
Glitters on Hackensack, sorrows on the land,   
Goes out like a pliant egg sucked down a bottle.   
Under the shadowing azure a violet
Dusk consumes the sharp walls of the world.   
The melancholy distributor of wit
Snatches at straws amid the alien darkness,   
A whirl of dusty danger.
                                     For his retreat
The priest lifts up the monstrance, muttering   
Abstracted Latin to the tinkle behind him.   
Presently they will bawl the Stabat Mater.   
And all those years at seminary, reading   
St. Basil and Jerome, girding his cassock   
For handball in the gritty cement courtyard   
Under the swooping smoke of the powerhouse;   
And ordination when the folks from Chicago   
Wept before the bishop. Mortify
The flesh. Think on thy last end. Pray
The Holy Mother of God in her infinite mercy,   
And Him who rests in the dark chapel always,   
Where the wick burns in wax, a cuddling flame:   
Deduced by Thomas from the tip of heaven. 
Or should I tumble to the recumbent   
Confessional, and the scientist of distress?   
For any child the terror in the night,
The hating eyes by day may be
Death’s cunning orchestration: they prepare   
The servant’s cry at last, absolute and lonely.   
See this easy gentleman in tweeds,
Deepchested, a swimmer to the farthest light,
Diagnostician of the subaqueous
Faces of dreams: with patience like a lover   
He must all day sustain his authority,   
Must not be bored, merciful or amused. 
Or the anatomist and healer of bones?   
Trepanner, skilled in suturing, the masked   
And sterile hero in the cone of light;
There the sweet ether cone must be inhaled   
With one, two pulses of the fiery spiral   
Singing into timeless speed or quiet:   
A mound under a sheet, a square of pale   
Mortal flesh incised in a seeping line,   
Spreading its lips for pretty butchery. 
Blankets, hypodermics and high fever,   
Racing delirium in the ward; the tall screen   
Efficiently deployed at the bedside;   
Intravenous ministrations: charts: starch:   
And how is he today. Pretty good, doc.   
Or else the fly sits down on the dead face   
In the dead sunny room. 
                                    Shall I have speech
With those undone by the world’s great memory?   
Men translated by music, treasurers   
Of the French phrase, the childhood images,   
Unregarded announcers of prophecy;   
Staring blind at the stained wall paper   
In their nightly rooms; their dreadful hearts   
Beating the beds where other hearts have slept
Like birds under the night wind of time.   
See this one whom the currents under earth   
Intoxicate, and the flosses of the sky:   
Weeping, weeping in vanity and grief
He walks toward remote dawn in the empty city,   
Facing the cold draft, fish-smell from the river,   
Necessitous of love. Masters of intricate   
Fancy, libertines of intelligence,
I. Until Jove let it be, no colonist
Mastered the wild earth; no land was marked,   
None parceled out or shared; but everyone   
Looked for his living in the common wold. 
And Jove gave poison to the blacksnakes, and   
Made the wolves ravage, made the ocean roll,   
Knocked honey from the leaves, took fire away—   
So man might beat out various inventions   
By reasoning and art.
                                 First he chipped fire
Out of the veins of flint where it was hidden;   
Then rivers felt his skiffs of the light alder;
Then sailors counted up the stars and named them:   
Pleiades, Hyades, and the Pole Star;
Then were discovered ways to take wild things.   
In snares, or hunt them with the circling pack;   
And how to whip a stream with casting nets,   
Or draw the deep-sea fisherman’s cordage up;   
And then the use of steel and the shrieking saw;   
Then various crafts. All things were overcome   
By labor and by force of bitter need. 
II. Even when your threshing floor is leveled   
By the big roller, smoothed and packed by hand   
With potter’s clay, so that it will not crack,   
There are still nuisances. The tiny mouse   
Locates his house and granary underground,
Or the blind mole tunnels his dark chamber;   
The toad, too, and all monsters of the earth,   
Besides those plunderers of the grain, the weevil   
And frantic ant, scared of a poor old age. 
Let me speak then, too, of the farmer’s weapons:   
The heavy oaken plow and the plowshare,   
The slowly rolling carts of Demeter,   
The threshing machine, the sledge, the weighted mattock,
The withe baskets, the cheap furniture,
The harrow and the magic winnowing fan—
All that your foresight makes provision of,   
If you still favor the divine countryside. 
III. Moreover, like men tempted by the straits
In ships borne homeward through the blowing sea,   
We too must reckon on Arcturus star,
The days of luminous Draco and the Kids.
When Libra makes the hours of sleep and daylight   
Equal, dividing the world, half light, half dark,   
Then drive the team, and sow the field with barley,   
Even under intractable winter’s rain.
But Spring is the time to sow your beans and clover,   
When shining Taurus opens the year with his golden   
Horns, and the Dog’s averted star declines;   
For greater harvests of your wheat and spelt,   
Let first the Pleiades and Hyades be hid
And Ariadne’s diadem go down.
The golden sun rules the great firmament
Through the twelve constellations, and the world   
Is measured out in certain parts, and heaven   
By five great zones is taken up entire:   
One glowing with sundazzle and fierce heat;   
And far away on either side the arctics,   
Frozen with ice and rain, cerulean;
And, in between, two zones for sick mankind:   
Through each of these a slanting path is cut   
Where pass in line the zodiacal stars. 
Northward the steep world rises to Scythia   
And south of Libya descends, where black   
Styx and the lowest of the dead look on.
In the north sky the Snake glides like a river   
Winding about the Great and Little Bear—   
Those stars that fear forever the touch of ocean;   
Southward they say profound Night, mother of Furies,   
Sits tight-lipped among the crowding shades,   
Or thence Aurora draws the daylight back;   
And where the East exhales the yellow morning,   
Reddening evening lights her stars at last.  
IV. As for the winter, when the freezing rains   
Confine the farmer, he may employ himself   
In preparations for serener seasons.
The plowman beats the plowshare on the forge,   
Or makes his vats of tree-trunks hollowed out,   
Brands his cattle, numbers his piles of grain,   
Sharpens fence posts or pitchforks, prepares   
Umbrian trellises for the slow vine.
Then you may weave the baskets of bramble twigs   
Or dip your bleating flock in the clean stream.   
Often the farmer loads his little mule
With olive oil or apples, and brings home
A grindstone or a block of pitch from market. 
And some will stay up late beside the fire   
On winter nights, whittling torches, while
The housewife runs the shuttle through the loom   
And comforts the long labor with her singing;   
Or at the stove she simmers the new wine,   
Skimming the froth with leaves. Oh idle time!   
In that hale season, all their worries past,
Farmers arrange convivialities—
As after laden ships have reached home port,
The happy sailors load the prow with garlands.   
Then is the time to gather acorns and
Laurel berries and the bloodred myrtle,
To lay your traps for cranes and snares for buck,   
To hit the fallow deer with twisted slingshots,   
And track the long-eared hare—
When snow is deep, and ice is on the rivers.  
V. What of the humors and the ways of Autumn? 
Just when the farmer wished to reap his yellow
Fields, and thresh his grain,
I have often seen all the winds make war,
Flattening the stout crops from the very roots;
And in the black whirlwind
Carrying off the ears and the light straw.
And often mighty phalanxes of rain
Marched out of heaven, as the clouds
Rolled up from the sea the detestable tempest;   
Then the steep aether thundered, and the deluge   
Soaked the crops, filled ditches, made the rivers   
Rise and roar and seethe in their spuming beds. 
The Father himself in the mid stormy night   
Lets the lightning go, at whose downstroke   
Enormous earth quivers, wild things flee,
And fear abases the prone hearts of men—   
As Jove splits Athos with his firebolt
Or Rhodope or the Ceraunian ridge.
The southwind wails in sheets of rain,
And under that great wind the groves
Lament, and the long breast of the shore is shaken. 
If you dislike to be so caught, mark well
The moon’s phases and the weather signs;
Notice where Saturn’s frigid star retires,
Mercury’s wanderings over heaven; and revere   
Especially, the gods. Offer to Ceres
Annual sacrifice and annual worship
In the first fair weather of the spring,
So may your sheep grow fat and your vines fruitful,   
Your sleep sweet and your mountains full of shade.   
Let all the country folk come to adore her,   
And offer her libations of milk and wine;
Conduct the sacrificial lamb three times
Around the ripe field, in processional,
With all your chorus singing out to Ceres;   
And let no man lay scythe against his grain   
Unless he first bind oakleaves on his head   
And make his little dance, and sing to her.  
VI. When shall we herd the cattle to the stables? 
The wind, say, rises without intermission;   
The sea gets choppy and the swell increases;   
The dry crash of boughs is heard on hills;   
The long sound of the surf becomes a tumult;   
The gusts become more frequent in the grove;   
The waves begin to fight against the keels;   
From far at sea the gulls fly shoreward crying;   
The heron leaves his favorite marsh and soars   
Over the high cloud. Then you will see   
Beyond thin skimrack, shooting stars
Falling, the long pale tracks behind them   
Whitening through the darkness of the night;   
And you’ll see straw and fallen leaves blowing.   
But when it thunders in rough Boreas’ quarter,   
When east and west it thunders—every sailor   
Furls his dripping sail. 
A storm should never catch you unprepared.   
Aerial cranes take flight before its rising,   
The restless heifer with dilated nostrils   
Sniffs the air; the squeaking hirondelle   
Flits round and round the lake, and frogs,
Inveterate in their mud, croak a chorale.   
And too the ant, more frantic in his gallery,   
Trundles his eggs out from their hiding place;   
The rainbow, cloud imbiber, may be seen;   
And crows go cawing from the pasture   
In a harsh throng of crepitating wings;   
The jeering jay gives out his yell for rain   
And takes a walk by himself on the dry sand.   
Stormwise, the various sea-fowl, and such birds   
As grub the sweet Swan River in Asia,
May be observed dousing themselves and diving
Or riding on the water, as if they wished—   
What odd exhilaration—to bathe themselves.  
VII. After a storm, clear weather and continuing   
Sunny days may likewise be foretold:
By the sharp twinkle of the stars, the moon   
Rising to face her brother’s rays by day;   
No tenuous fleeces blowing in the sky,   
No halcyons, sea favorites, on the shore   
Stretching out their wings in tepid sunlight;   
But mists go lower and lie on the fields,
The owl, observing sundown from his perch,   
Modulates his meaningless melancholy.   
Aloft in crystal air the sparrow hawk   
Chases his prey; and as she flits aside
The fierce hawk follows screaming on the wind,   
And as he swoops, she flits aside again.   
With funereal contractions of the windpipe   
The crows produce their caws, three at a time,
And in their high nests, pleased at I know not what,   
Noise it among themselves: no doubt rejoicing   
To see their little brood after the storm,
But not, I think, by reason of divine
Insight or superior grasp of things.  
VIII. But if you carefully watch the rapid sun   
And the moon following, a fair night’s snare   
Never deceives you as to next day’s weather.   
When the new moon collects a rim of light,   
If that bow be obscured with a dark vapor,   
Then a great tempest is in preparation;   
If it be blushing like a virgin’s cheek,   
There will be wind; wind makes Diana blush;   
If on the fourth night (most significant)   
She goes pure and unclouded through the sky,   
All that day and the following days will be,
For one full month, exempt from rain and wind.   
The sun, too, rising and setting in the waves,   
Will give you weather signs, trustworthy ones   
Whether at morning or when stars come out.   
A mackerel sky over the east at sunrise   
Means look out for squalls, a gale is coming,   
Unfavorable to trees and plants and flocks.   
Or when through denser strata the sun’s rays   
Break out dimly, or Aurora rises
Pale from Tithonus’ crocus-colored chamber,   
Alas, the vine-leaf will not shield the cluster   
In the hubbub of roof-pattering bitter hail.
It will be well to notice sunset, too,
For the sun’s visage then has various colors;   
Bluish and dark means rain; if it be fiery   
That means an East wind; if it be dappled
And mixed with red gold light, then you will see   
Wind and rain in commotion everywhere.   
Nobody can advise me, on that night,   
To cast off hawsers and put out to sea.   
But if the next day passes and the sunset   
Then be clear, you need not fear the weather:   
A bright Norther will sway the forest trees.  
IX. Last, what the late dusk brings, and whence the fair
Clouds are blown, and secrets of the Southwind   
You may learn from the sun, whose prophecies   
No man denies, seeing black insurrections,   
Treacheries, and wars are told by him. 
When Caesar died, the great sun pitied Rome,   
So veiling his bright head, the godless time   
Trembled in fear of everlasting night;
And then were portents given of earth and ocean,   
Vile dogs upon the roads, and hideous   
Strange birds, and Aetna quaking, and her fires   
Bursting to overflow the Cyclops’ fields
With flames whirled in the air and melted stones.   
Thunder of war was heard in Germany   
From south to north, shaking the granite Alps;   
And a voice also through the silent groves
Piercing; and apparitions wondrous pale   
Were seen in dead of night. Then cattle spoke
(O horror!), streams stood still, the earth cracked open   
And tears sprang even from the temple bronze.   
The Po, monarch of rivers, on his back   
Spuming whole forests, raced through the lowland plains
And bore off pens and herds; and then continually   
The viscera of beasts were thick with evil,
Blood trickled from the springs; tall towns at night   
Re-echoed to the wolf-pack’s shivering howl;   
And never from pure heaven have there fallen   
So many fires, nor baleful comets burned.   
It seemed that once again the Roman lines,   
Alike in arms, would fight at Philippi;
And heaven permitted those Thessalian fields   
To be enriched again with blood of ours.   
Some future day, perhaps, in that country,   
A farmer with his plow will turn the ground,   
And find the javelins eaten thin with rust,   
Or knock the empty helmets with his mattock   
And wonder, digging up those ancient bones. 
Paternal gods! Ancestors! Mother Vesta!   
You that guard Tiber and the Palatine!   
Now that long century is overthrown,
Let not this young man fail to give us peace!   
Long enough beneath your rule, O Caesar,   
Heaven has hated us and all those triumphs   
Where justice was thrown down—so many wars,   
So many kinds of wickedness! No honor
Rendered the plow, but the fields gone to ruin,   
The country-folk made homeless, and their scythes   
Beaten to straight swords on the blowing forge!   
War from the Euphrates to Germany;
Ruptured engagements, violence of nations,
And impious Mars raging the whole world over—
As when a four horsed chariot rears away   
Plunging from the barrier, and runs wild,   
Heedless of the reins or the charioteer.
Terrorizers of themselves, laughers in   
Language and priests of any mystery—   
Not by authority. 
                           What of the revered
Historian, the painstaking public man?
His dusty briefcase worn to a splitting bulge,   
The scholar descending from the library   
Smiles at the doves, and at the glowing grass.   
Letters gone frail and yellow in their strings   
Spill fuzz and dust from the stuck folds:
It might be inferred from what the ambassador   
Wrote to his daughter in Virginia
That others were privy to the situation.   
These judges are gentle and well-cultivated   
Honorable stylists, penetrating men,
Mirrors of duplicity and bewilderment,   
Mirrors of magnificent deep-rooted structural   
Policy and implacable miscarriage.
The documents are all photostated, the files   
Arranged. Let humane logic
Guide them in the wilderness of the State.   
The pallid husbandman grunts at his fields,
Sells his new lambs in the damp of March,   
Thumbs the slick catalogue of the mail order   
House for ginghams for the girls of summer;   
Chews with the county agent at the gate.   
He will be ruddy as the sun goes over,   
The clouds go over, the tractor shudders on   
Through the high fields. The piling west will grow   
Fractious with lightning, the wild branches bend,   
Curtains blow out like goodbye handkerchiefs   
Hilarious in the gloomy wind. Autumn   
Comes with marriages to the aging house,   
Winter comes with comforts and old death.   
Still the farmer’s dull hand holds the seed;   
The low star glimmers on the dewy sill.

The wind may blow the snow about,
 For all I care, says Jack,And I don’t mind how cold it grows,
 For then the ice won’t crack.Old folks may shiver all day long,
 But I shall never freeze;What cares a jolly boy like me
 For winter days like these?
Far down the long snow-covered hills
 It is such fun to coast,So clear the road! the fastest sled
 There is in school I boast.The paint is pretty well worn off,
 But then I take the lead;A dandy sled’s a loiterer,
 And I go in for speed.
When I go home at supper-time,
 Ki! but my cheeks are red!They burn and sting like anything;
 I’m cross until I’m fed.You ought to see the biscuit go,
 I am so hungry then;And old Aunt Polly says that boys
 Eat twice as much as men.
There’s always something I can do
 To pass the time away;The dark comes quick in winter-time—
 A short and stormy dayAnd when I give my mind to it,
 It’s just as father says,I almost do a man’s work now,
 And help him many ways.
I shall be glad when I grow up
 And get all through with school,I’ll show them by-and-by that I
 Was not meant for a fool.I’ll take the crops off this old farm,
 I’ll do the best I can.A jolly boy like me won’t be
 A dolt when he’s a man.
I like to hear the old horse neigh
 Just as I come in sight,The oxen poke me with their horns
 To get their hay at night.Somehow the creatures seem like friends,
 And like to see me come.Some fellows talk about New York,
 But I shall stay at home.

Absorbed in planting bulbs, that work of hope,
I was startled by a loud human voice,
“Do go on working while I talk. Don’t stop!”
And I was caught upon the difficult choice—
To yield the last half hour of precious light,
Or to stay on my knees, absurd and rude;
I willed her to be gone with all my might,
This kindly neighbor who destroyed a mood;
I could not think of next spring any more,
I had to re-assess the way I live.
Long after I went in and closed the door,
I pondered on the crude imperative. 
What it is to be caught up in each day
Like a child fighting imaginary wars,
Converting work into this passionate play,
A rounded whole made up of different chores
Which one might name haphazard meditation.
And yet an unexpected call destroys
Or puts to rout my primitive elation:
Why be so serious about mere joys?
Is this where some outmoded madness lies,
Poet as recluse? No, what comes to me
Is how my father looked out of his eyes,
And how he fought for his own passionate play. 
He could tear up unread and throw away
Communications from officialdom,
And, courteous in every other way,
Would not brook anything that kept him from
Those lively dialogues with man’s whole past
That were his intimate and fruitful pleasure.
Impetuous, impatient to the last,
“Be adamant, keep clear, strike for your treasure!”
I hear the youthful ardor in his voice
(And so I must forgive a self in labor).
I feel his unrepentant smiling choice,
(And so I ask forgiveness of my neighbor).

A fall over rock,
Metal answering to water,   
Is the seal of this spot;
A land trodden by music   
And the tune forgot. 
Of a region savage,
The territory that was broken,
Silver gushed free;
And earth holy, earth meek shall receive it   
In humility. 
This, not dwelt in, this haunted,   
The country of the proud,
Is curdling to stone,
And careless of the feet of the waters   
As they glance from it down.

Now the rich cherry, whose sleek wood,
And top with silver petals traced
Like a strict box its gems encased,
Has spilt from out that cunning lid,
All in an innocent green round,
Those melting rubies which it hid;
With moss ripe-strawberry-encrusted,
So birds get half, and minds lapse merry
To taste that deep-red, lark’s-bite berry,
And blackcap bloom is yellow-dusted. 
The wren that thieved it in the eaves
A trailer of the rose could catch
To her poor droopy sloven thatch,
And side by side with the wren’s brood—
O lovely time of beggar’s luck—
Opens the quaint and hairy bud;
And full and golden is the yield
Of cows that never have to house,
But all night nibble under boughs,
Or cool their sides in the moist field. 
Into the rooms flow meadow airs,
The warm farm baking smell’s blown round.
Inside and out, and sky and ground
Are much the same; the wishing star,
Hesperus, kind and early born,
Is risen only finger-far;
All stars stand close in summer air,
And tremble, and look mild as amber;
When wicks are lighted in the chamber,
They are like stars which settled there. 
Now straightening from the flowery hay,
Down the still light the mowers look,
Or turn, because their dreaming shook,
And they waked half to other days,
When left alone in the yellow stubble
The rusty-coated mare would graze.
Yet thick the lazy dreams are born,
Another thought can come to mind,
But like the shivering of the wind,
Morning and evening in the corn.

The big front wall that blocks off the courtyard
often catches the newborn light of the sun
like the side of a barn. The body awakes
in the morning to a room, messy and empty,
that smells of the first, clumsy perfume.
Even that body, wrapped now in sheets,
is the same that it was when it thrilled in discovery. 
Her body wakes alone to the extended call
of morning, the languor of another morning
returning in the heavy shadows: the barn
of childhood and the heavy tiredness of sun
hot in the indolent doorways. A perfume
worked itself into the usual sweat
of her hair, a smell the animals knew.
Her body took secret pleasure in the sun’s
suggestive, serene caress—like a real touch. 
The languor of bed saps the sprawled limbs,
still youthful and plump, like a child’s.
The clumsy child used to smell the mixed scent
of tobacco and hay, used to tremble when touched
by the man’s quick hands: she liked playing games.
Sometimes she played lying down with the man
in the hay, but he wasn’t smelling her hair:
he’d find her closed legs in the hay and pry
them open, then crush her like he was her father.
The perfume was flowers ground upon stones. 
It often returns, in the slow rise from sleep,
that undone aroma of far-off flowers,
of barns and of sun. No man can know
the subtle caress of that sour memory.
No man can see, beyond that sprawled body,
that childhood passed in such clumsy anxiety.


^^EOP^^

These be two
Country women.
What a size!
Great big arms
And round red faces;
Big substantial
Sit down places;
Great big bosoms firm as cheese
Bursting through their country jackets;
Wide big laps
And sturdy knees;
Hands outspread,
Round and rosy,
Hands to hold
A country posy
Or a baby or a lamb—
      And such eyes!
Stupid, shifty, small and sly
Peeping through a slit of sty,
Squinting through their neighbours’ plackets.

The oldest sister, her two hands on the table,
about to push herself up, stares with grim
determination at the affronting dishes,
waiting, it seems, until the middle sister
finishes her story, so she can clear them away.
Her gaze so tense with purpose she can almost
see germs spawning in the mess of white fish
flaking from the spines, the smear of egg yolk
and the torn rolls disfiguring the china;
as if the meal, the moment it is over,
the meal she made a point of telling them
she shopped for, got up early to prepare,
were now inedible, because uneaten.
It’s no great comfort either that her brother
sitting opposite holds up a flared match
over the pipe from which smoke rolls away
across the table like a phantom mold
in and around the open tub of butter,
the gouged block of cream cheese and the coffee cups;
so in a moment when she finally does stand 
she’ll say again, as always, For love or money
in my mouth I’d never put such filth,
and he’ll say, winking at the middle sister,
That’s what she said on her honeymoon. 
The youngest sister is sitting on the couch
behind the table; her face—sheer disengagement,
toneless and still—appears to hang suspended
beyond the oldest sister’s shoulder, far
enough away for no one yet to notice
as her legs cross that the ashtray in her lap
spills ash over the sunflowers of her housedress.
Or that the cigarette between her fingers
sags loosely and is dangling while the hand
lifts like a puppet’s on a string of smoke. 
Her death is just three months away. 
Even though it’s summer (otherwise
the brother and middle sister would be home,
in Florida), summer and late morning—
with sunlight only just now catching on
a corner of the window shut behind them,
shut against the smog, the steady traffic
and the panicked blare and drawn-out whining fade
of sirens—the apartment is still quiet,
still cool enough, right now, to keep the body
in the wavering frail zone of what it needs
to be forgotten, so they can sit like this
together, with the oldest sister’s sharp eye
on the wrecked meal, the brother and sister talking: 
Listen, she would be saying, listen, Charlie,
her elbows on the table, both hands open,
the body fashioned to the voice’s weary
What can you do? What are ya gonna do?
in answer to some story of a cousin’s
sudden illness (And he was my age, just
like that one day he’s shaving with the toothpaste),
or a friend’s death (That one, she didn’t care
how sick she got, she always had her hair done),
his back pain, her arthritis, or the daughter
who won’t diet (And she’d be such a beauty!);
after his joke about the nurse, and hers
about the bedpan, Listen, they each say,
Listen, what are ya gonna do? 
                                              “The Schmo,
he never should’ve married her, for Christ sake,
until he told her that he had a problem,
that was his first mistake, then he goes
throwing away his pills, because he’s happy
he doesn’t need them anymore, the schmo,
so of course what happens is she wakes up
and finds him weeping at the kitchen table,
just weeping, he doesn’t know why, he won’t eat,
won’t get dressed, says he’s quittin’ his job,
you know, nuts, nuts, so naturally she leaves him,
the poor schmo, and he’s such a good boy . . . ” 
All of the harm that’s imperceptibly
but surely coming for them (the way the sun
burns brick by brick all morning toward the window
like a slow fuse)—all of the bad news now
is in the body only enough to hold
the middle sister’s two hands open, shrug
her shoulders in a way they recognize
as hers, the way their mother did; as if
all trouble were, for now, no heavier
than the familiar voice repeating, Listen,
Listen it could be worse; So who’s to say?;
What was, was; When your number’s up—like old charms
woven around each story till they’ve made
what happens what was only meant to happen,
coherent with fate, fated as family. 
After the funeral three months from now,
they’ll have to listen to the oldest sister
tell them they had no business moving away
to Florida, and Irene sick as she was.
And selfish. She was selfish, that one. After
all those years of living with that bum,
her husband, may his cheap soul rest in peace,
didn’t she deserve a little pleasure?
And anyway, what could be done for her?
Didn’t the stroke just make it easier
for her to sit all day, and smoke, and not care
ashes were falling on the couch, the carpet;
her bathrobe filthy, filthy? Oh it was terrible—
and now they will hear the old unfairnesses,
old feuds and resentments come to her voice
like consolation, like a mother helping
her recite the story of that last bad day—
all that smoke, and running in with nothing
but the dishtowel to beat down the flames,
and Irene, just Irene, just sitting there,
the queen of Sheba—What difference did it make
since she was there, she was always there,
her big sister, to clean up the mess? 
Only three months, and yet it could be years,
or decades, for the sun has only just now
caught in the window, and its bright plaque warms
the air so gradually that none of them
can know it’s warming, or that soon someone,
distracted by a faint sheen prickling the skin,
will break the story, look up toward the window
and, startled by the full glare, check the time.
Right now, though, the future is a luxury
of instances in which the cigarette,
raised halfway to the lips, will go on rising.
Nothing bad, right now, can happen here
except as news, bad news the brother and sister
mull and rehearse, puzzle and fret until
it seems the very telling of it is
what keeps them safe. And safe, too, the oldest sister,
dreaming of all the perishables sealed,
wrapped up and hurried back into the fridge’s
uncontaminated airlessness,
dreaming of how the soapsuds curdle and slide
over the dishes in a soothing fury,
not minding that it scalds her hands to hold
each plate and cup and bowl under the hot,
hard jet of water, if it gets them clean.

The idea that they were reenacting something which had been staged in the first place bothered her. If she wanted to go on, she’d need to ignore this limp chronology. She assumed he was conscious of the same constraint. But she almost always did want to proceed. Procedure! If only either one of them believed in the spontaneity of the original actors and could identify with one. Be one. For this to work, she reasoned, one of us would have to be gone.

All me are standing on feed. The sky is shining. 
All me have just been milked. Teats all tingling still   
from that dry toothless sucking by the chilly mouths   
that gasp loudly in in in, and never breathe out. 
All me standing on feed, move the feed inside me.
One me smells of needing the bull, that heavy urgent me,   
the back-climber, who leaves me humped, straining, but light   
and peaceful again, with crystalline moving inside me. 
Standing on wet rock, being milked, assuages the calf-sorrow in me.
Now the me who needs mounts on me, hopping, to signal the bull. 
The tractor comes trotting in its grumble; the heifer human   
bounces on top of it, and cud comes with the tractor,   
big rolls of tight dry feed: lucerne, clovers, buttercup, grass,   
that’s been bitten but never swallowed, yet is cud.
She walks up over the tractor and down it comes, roll on roll   
and all me following, eating it, and dropping the good pats. 
The heifer human smells of needing the bull human   
and is angry. All me look nervously at her
as she chases the dog me dream of horning dead: our enemy   
of the light loose tongue. Me’d jam him in his squeals. 
Me, facing every way, spreading out over feed. 
One me is still in the yard, the place skinned of feed.   
Me, old and sore-boned, little milk in that me now,   
licks at the wood. The oldest bull human is coming. 
Me in the peed yard. A stick goes out from the human   
and cracks, like the whip. Me shivers and falls down
with the terrible, the blood of me, coming out behind an ear.   
Me, that other me, down and dreaming in the bare yard. 
All me come running. It’s like the Hot Part of the sky   
that’s hard to look at, this that now happens behind wood   
in the raw yard. A shining leaf, like off the bitter gum tree   
is with the human. It works in the neck of me
and the terrible floods out, swamped and frothy. All me make the Roar,
some leaping stiff-kneed, trying to horn that worst horror.
The wolf-at-the-calves is the bull human. Horn the bull human! 
But the dog and the heifer human drive away all me. 
Looking back, the glistening leaf is still moving.
All of dry old me is crumpled, like the hills of feed,   
and a slick me like a huge calf is coming out of me. 
The carrion-stinking dog, who is calf of human and wolf,   
is chasing and eating little blood things the humans scatter,   
and all me run away, over smells, toward the sky.

Sir, I am not a bird of prey:
a Lady does not seize the day.
I trust that brief Time will unfold
our youth, before he makes us old.
How could we two write lines of rhyme
were we not fond of numbered Time
and grateful to the vast and sweet
trials his days will make us meet?
The Grave's not just the body's curse;
no skeleton can pen a verse!
So while this numbered World we see,
let's sweeten Time with poetry,
and Time, in turn, may sweeten Love
and give us time our love to prove.
You've praised my eyes, forehead, breast:
you've all our lives to praise the rest.

Instead of a cup of tea, instead of a milk-
silk whelk of a cup, of a cup of nearly six
o'clock teatime, cup of a stumbling block,
cup of an afternoon unredeemed by talk,
cup of a cut brown loaf, of a slice, a lack
of butter, blueberry jam that's almost black,
instead of tannin seeping into the cracks
of a pot, the void of an hour seeps out, infects
the slit of a cut I haven't the wit to fix
with a surgeon's needle threaded with fine-gauge silk
as a key would thread the cylinder of a lock.
But no key threads the cylinder of a lock.
Late afternoon light, transitory, licks
the place of the absent cup with its rough tongue, flicks
itself out beneath the wheel's revolving spoke.
Taut thought's gone, with a blink of attention, slack,
a vision of "death and distance in the mix"
(she lost her words and how did she get them back
when the corridor of a day was a lurching deck?
The dream-life logic encodes in nervous tics
she translated to a syntax which connects
intense and unfashionable politics
with morning coffee, Hudson sunsets, sex;
then the short-circuit of the final stroke,
the end toward which all lines looped out, then broke).
What a gaze out the window interjects:
on the southeast corner, a black Lab balks,
tugged as the light clicks green toward a late-day walk
by a plump brown girl in a purple anorak.
The Bronx-bound local comes rumbling up the tracks
out of the tunnel, over west Harlem blocks
whose windows gleam on the animal warmth of bricks
rouged by the fluvial light of six o'clock.

I   Or Your Woman 
The night was a bad one.
I only saw one other person out:
A big black man on muleback
Riding along the levee, marking the water. 
There was a lantern in his hand
And what you could call a grim smile on the lips.
I shifted down gears,
Rolled down the window, turned the radio low. 
And said, “Say there, man, how goes it?”
But he couldn’t hear me for the rain
And the song on his transistor radio.
“I don’t know,” he said, “but it’s raining, 
Raining to beat hell.”
Said I, “Do you think it’s going to quit?”
“Friend, I couldn’t tell you.”
When big water will, you call everyman friend . . . 
We said our goodnights,
Went on, by mule and flatbed truck, wearing black
Rubber, cold to the bone,
Like divers from different ships meeting below. 
All you can do is nod, some of the times.
At least, we spoke, knowing that living
Anywhere near the river
You speak when you can; the only thing you try 
To hold is your liquor,
And we had none, that bad night on the levee.
Always down the road, I looked up
In the mirror.  And I’m sure he’d a done the same.  
II   Midnight 
I almost slid off, once
Imagining this cloud was a pall
And the moon was a body.
I don’t know who put coins over her eyes. 
When I got to Rampion’s Ferry,
I thought I was the only one there.
I mean it was quiet,
Except for the current, the cables, and the rain. 
I got a piece of rope
Out of the back of my truck, and wound it
Around the generator
Engine; it kicked right off the first pull. 
The yellow bug lights came on,
And I saw a body move under a purple blanket.
He cussed me out
For waking him up, pulling his old self up. 
There was some kind of fish
In the weave of his poncho; other figures
Of snakes and birds, too.
I didn’t mean to wake the awnry fellow up, 
I wonder if I did.
A strange odor came from underneath him
When he dragged out his towsack.
It didn’t smell of something burning, but of 
Something that was singed.
Like the rain, it didn’t let up.
“Are we going crosst it, or not,”
He told me in a voice, half-blooded song.  
III   Some Past Twelve 
Someone with a light
Rode up before I could see what all
He was pulling from the burlap:   
Blue calling chalk you find in pool halls, ivory 
Tusks, a stringer with rotten heads
The good book and another I couldn’t pronounce—
Just as worn,
And one of those paperweight crystals that snows. 
He had strummed the mandolin twice,
A couple of sounds blue as a fox in trouble
In a snowdrift on a ridge, like weeds
Burning underwater, a few licks of silent fire. 
When I recognized the lookout
The ferry wasn’t more than a few feet off the bank,
So the mule made it aboard, easy;
Its hooves on the planks like a mad, rough carpenter 
Nailing driftwood together.
Oh, we made it across.  We didn’t exactly
Hit the dock on the head,
But we floated on down to Vahalia’s Landing. 
We had a good time.
The foreigner played the mandolin, the river
Reached its crest,
And the man on the mule and I drank way into the morning. 
They heard us, the ones on land.
“We’re a floating whorehouse, without noun women.”
And in the dead of night,
Rain and all, we motioned them on.


^^EOP^^




Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me—Daniel 10:18



febrile body I woke into: nightsweats, stink of the toil of living:  
where hands could not bear to approach me, the young man fingered
lay upon me, was himself a cool sponge, drew my perspiration to his lips ice-chips he held in his teeth, he pushed small bergs into my mouth
caressed the skeletal arms I’ve hidden in long sleeves kissed neck and chest, belly rotten with pudgy organs, thick-set flesh
he pressed against me, cock on cock and tongue against tongue saw his reflection in my marshy eyes and did not flinch such weakness 
held, sustained by this capable stroke, boatswain of my crossing
I take the death I’m moored to, announced as a measureless promontory and bob in the river like a bloated corpse, blue lips, vacant gaze
I let the water fill my lungs until they rip their festive piñatas because the one who comes to gather me, capricious angel 
has a voice that affirms me rising when this fever abates
For Haines Eason

Rotting in the wet gray air
the railroad depot stands deserted under
still green trees. In the fields
cold begins an end. 
There were other too-long-postponed departures.
They left, finally, because of well water
gone rank, the smell of fungus, the chill
of rain in chimneys. 
The spot is abandoned even in memory.
They knew, locking doors upon empty houses,
to leave without regret is to lose
title to one home forever.


^^EOP^^

The crowd at the ball game
is moved uniformly 
by a spirit of uselessness
which delights them— 
all the exciting detail
of the chase 
and the escape, the error
the flash of genius— 
all to no end save beauty
the eternal— 
So in detail they, the crowd,
are beautiful 
for this
to be warned against 
saluted and defied—
It is alive, venomous 
it smiles grimly
its words cut— 
The flashy female with her
mother, gets it— 
The Jew gets it straight— it
is deadly, terrifying— 
It is the Inquisition, the
Revolution 
It is beauty itself
that lives 
day by day in them
idly— 
This is
the power of their faces 
It is summer, it is the solstice
the crowd is 
cheering, the crowd is laughing
in detail 
permanently, seriously
without thought


^^EOP^^

Too much rain
loosens trees.
In the hills giant oaks
fall upon their knees.
You can touch parts
you have no right to—
places only birds
should fly to.


^^EOP^^

Off go the crows from the roof.
The crows can’t hold on.
They might as well
Be perched on an oil slick. 
Such an awkward dance,
These gentlemen
In their spottled-black coats.
Such a tipsy dance, 
As if they didn’t know where they were.
Such a humorous dance,
As they try to set things right,
As the wind reduces them. 
Such a sorrowful dance.
How embarrassing is love
When it goes wrong 
In front of everyone.


^^EOP^^




for Lawson Fusao Inada and Alan Chong Lau



I.  A Porphyry of Elements  
Starting in a long swale between the Sierras
   and the Coast Range,
Starting from ancient tidepools of a Pleistocene sea,
Starting from exposed granite bedrock,
From sandstone and shale, glaciated, river-worn,
   and scuffed by wind,
Tired of the extremes of temperature,
   the weather’s wantonness,
Starting from the survey of a condor’s eye
Cutting circles in the sky over Tehachapi and Tejon,
Starting from lava flow and snow on Shasta,
   a head of white hair,
   a garland of tongue-shaped obsidian,
Starting from the death of the last grizzly,
The final conversion of Tulare County
   to the internal-combustion engine,
Staring from California oak and acorn,
   scrubgrass, rivermist,
   and lupine in the foothills,
From days driving through the outfield clover
   of Modesto in a borrowed Buick,
From nights drinking pitchers of dark
   in the Neon Moon Bar & Grill,
From mornings grabbing a lunchpail, work gloves,
   and a pisspot hat,
From Digger pine and Douglas fir and aspen around Placerville,
From snowmelt streams slithering into the San Joaquin,
From the deltas and levees and floods of the Sacramento,
From fall runs of shad, steelhead, and salmon,
From a gathering of sand, rock, gypsum, clay,
   limestone, water, and tar,
From a need or desire to throw your money away
   in The Big City,
From a melting of history and space in the crucible
   of an oil-stained hand—
Starting from all these, this porphyry of elements,
   this aggregate of experiences
Fused like feldspar and quartz to the azure stone
   of memory and vision,
Starting from all of these and an affectionate eye
   for straight, unending lines,
We hit this old road of Highway Ninety-Nine!

III.  Cruising in the Greater Vehicle/A Jam Session 
“Well, goddamnit, Lawson! Whyn’t you play in key and keep to the
rhythm? First you say you wanna go back to Fresno, back to the fish store
and Kamaboko Gardens on the West Side, and then you say, forget it, I
take it back, let’s go to the Sacto Bon-Odori instead.” 
“Yeah. And this ain’t even shoyu season yet, chump!” 
“Awww, hell. What’s wrong with you two? Can’t you improvise? You
know, I’m just laying down a bass, man. Just a rhythm, a scale,
something to jam on, something to change, find our range, something to
get us going. Once we get started, we can work our way around to Weed,
put on some tire chains, or break down in Selma, refuse to buy grapes,
raisins, or Gallo, do a pit-stop at a Sacto sporting goods, pick up some air
mattresses shaped like pearl-diving women, and float all day downriver to
the deltas, sipping Cokes and saké in the summer heat.” 
“Shit. Whyn’t you just solo and forget the rest of us? You start chanting
and pretty soon we’re hearing the entire Lotus Sutra.” 
“You two Buddhaheads just a pair of one-eyed Japs with dishpan hands
and deadpan minds, man. This is the Champ Chonk talking, and we’re
playing Chinese anaconda. Eight-card, no-peek pak-kai, roll your own,
hi-lo, three for sweep, four for hot-sour soup stud, and neither of you’s
put down your ante yet. So shit or get off the shu-mai, fellas.” 
“Calm down and watch the road, Alan.” 
“Who’s driving this heap, anyway?” 
“I thought you were.” 
“I thought Lawson was.” 
“Don’t worry. This is a dodo-driven, autopiloted, cruise-controlled, Triple-
A-mapped, Flying-A-gassed, dual-overhead-cam, Super-Sofistifunktified,
Frijole Guacamole, Gardena Guahuanco, Chonk Chalupa Cruiser with
Buddha Bandit Bumpers, Jack!” 
“Where we going, Alan?” 
“Where do you think? We’re going to Paradise.” 
IV.  On the Road to Paradise 
Distances don’t matter
nor the roll of the road past walnut groves.
It’s sky that counts,
the color of it at dawn or sunset,
a match more true to the peach
than a mix of oils by Matisse.
Or maybe it’s actually the weather
we love most, the way it shifts
and scatters over the state
like radio waves bouncing off the face of the moon.
The one over there, near Yuba City,
rising over a backyard garden
of onions, tomatoes, squash, and corn.
The one with the spider
scrambling through celery,
harvesting moths and mayflies
from the web it has strung between stalks.
Sometimes I wish I could harvest the weather,
reap it like wheat or rice,
store it in a silo
announcing steady rain or clear skies on its sides.
When the prices rise,
I could ship hailstorms or Santanas in orange crates,
make Safeway go broke,
do something politically efficacious for a change.
But all I really do besides write these poems
is allow my mind to wander while I drive.
There it goes, down the arroyo,
through manzanita and Mormon tea.
Or there, up the mustard and Indian pipe on the hill.
Might as well let it.
Nothing but God and Country on the radio now.
Wolfman Jack’s syndicated and the Dodgers
haven’t made it to Vero Beach.
I wish this road would turn or bend,
intersect with a spy movie some Spanish galleon,
or maybe a Chinese poem with landscapes
in brocade, mist, wine, and moonlight.
This California moon is yellow most of the time,
like it was stained with nicotine,
or sealed in amber like an insect.
Why is it always better somewhere else?
Why do I always wish I were Tu Fu? 
V.  Palmistry Fantasia   
There, the pasteboard and neon hand!
Just past the interchange by the bowling alley.
The one with silver rockets, small green stars,
and a trail of red comets flashing through the smog. 
It’s still here, the hand
held up in greeting or command.
“Halt!” it says, or
“Peace be with you, brother,”
while the map across its palm
traces excursions into blue trees,
green skies, and mushroom-colored lives. 
Blue dun is the color of its neon,
the same as the throat feathers of a teal
scudding over the marshes of Merced.
It matches the purple mascara the gypsy woman wears,
matches the pools of velvet-blue darkness in her eyes. 
Her name is Alma Josephina,
and she designed the sign herself,
imitating the figure of her own hand,
the neon indicative of its natural aura. 
That was twenty years ago
when Eisenhower was President
and all her customers wore pedal pushers
or Bermudas, and never noticed
the fireflies in the marshes at night. 
                           * 
You’re Oriental, aren’t you?
Can you read tea leaves?
I tried to once, years ago,
had a Chinese woman teaching me,
but her fees were too steep. 
I like a joke.
It loosens up the customers. 
Well, come here towards the light.
Let me get a good look
at the ghosts in the grave of your palm.
They’re there, you know.
All the people you’ve ever been,
all the trips you’ve taken
and the towns you’ve settled in,
back before the birth of Christ,
back before people were people,
before this paw was a hand. 
You see?   The whole palm glows
like purple mist over a cemetery.
Move closer.   Clamp it around the glass.
See it flare on the inside?
That’s the light your bones make,
not the crystal at all. 
Look at your hand now.
You can see yourself dancing
on the heel just above the wrist.
You must be a happy man.
You’ll be born again and again,
get to the threshold of Heaven,
never enter but keep coming back,
here, for fun, for friends,
until this will be Paradise,
and Paradise just an old resort
the highway’s passed by. 
Well, have a nice trip.
You’ll make it yet.
Says so right in that curvy line
around the Mound of Venus,
that thumbstump there,
right where the long straight line
cuts across like an interstate. 
VI.  Postcards Sent Home 
1.   
Dust rolls out of the hills like fog,
and it’s too hot for shoes or shirts.
I’d like to take my hair off too,
peel it from my head, dip it in a bucket of ice,
and wear it around my neck like a bandana. 
2.
Crickets attend the night,
add a falsetto drone
to the sound of us
pissing in the tumbleweeds. 
3.   
There’s a Tastee-Freeze in Fresno,
A & Dub’s closed down,
Jack-in-the-Box keeps popping up,
and McDonald’s owns the town. 
4.   
Somebody’s drying tobacco leaves
on the laundry line.
There, see them furl
and flap next to the nylons? 
5.
A giant oak uncurls over the road,
sprinkles a fine yellow powder on the windshield.
The sun hits, touches it off
in a spasm of golden-red light. 
VII.  Body & Fender/Body & Soul 
At the grill, the Indian girl with buckteeth and dimples serves us a round
of coffee and sweet rolls. We’re waiting for the guy at Henley’s Texaco,
down the street, to find us a fan belt that’ll fit.   It’s early, the sky’s still in
the john, shaving, and the sports page has to wait to get in. Everybody’s
grumpy. We sit around, jab at raisins with our forks, and try to look as
tough as the waitresss. 
                           Her name’s Rita. Her brothers jump fires and pump
oil in Alaska. Her sisters string beads and make babies back on the Res.
Her ex is white, a logger who threatened never to come back and didn’t.
She doesn’t hold any grudges. That’s why she’s so nice, why she pops her
gum filling the salt and pepper shakers, why she adjusts her girdle so we
can see, why the egg spot on her dress doesn’t show.
                                             
                                             Outside, the sun eases up over
the parking lot, scrambles across the freeway, and runs for cover behind a
pile of pumpkin-colored clouds. 99 starts shuffling its deck of cars and
pickups, getting set to deal a hand of nine-to-five stud. We don’t watch.   
This is Redding, and ain’t nothing thing going on besides the day shift. 
                                             Alan says, “Look, there’s Venus,” and
points to a piece of light draining the sky. I want to order a country-
fried steak, talk about the Dodgers, but there isn’t time. Lawson hums a
few chords, stirring the changes with his coffee spoon.
                                    
                                                               Rita cruises back like
a bus bound for Reno, starts dealing some ashtrays. She says, “How’s it
going boys?” 
               I answer for all of us—“Hey, Rita. It’s almost gone.” 
VIII.  Pilgrimage to the Shrine 
Six hours since
the Paradise Cutoff
and running on empty.
No gas stations or rest stops,
no weigh station, no cops.
Just miles of straight road
and a long double-yellow
unrolling in front of us. 
Alan recognized nothing.
Lawson pops the glove,
pulls out a penlight,
and fingers the map,
pronouncing a few mantras. 
Our headlights slide
over a scarecrow
made of tumbleweeds
standing by the road. 
He’s wearing a kimono,
a dark-blue stovepipe hat,
his shoulders cloaked
in a wreath of chrysanthemums. 
We pull over,
back up,
and he disappears
into the pale-
grey darkness. 
It’s smoke.
We can smell it,
so somebody’s
got to be
close by. 
But our eyes
go blined, fill
with tears and ashes
as we stumble
down the off-ramp. 
The smell of
frying trout
and steamed rice
reaches us when
we come to. 
An old hermit,
dressed like the scarecrow,
crawls out of his barracks
and brings us tea. 
“Drink!” he says,
“It’ll pick you up!”
And so we drink,
feeling drugged. 
Soft blues
in the key
of sleep
suffocates the air. 
From up the mountain,
the sound of obsidian,
flaking in the wind.
Clouds of black glass
waltz around us. 
We dress ourselves
in shrouds of tule reeds
stitched with barbed wire,
stained with salt and mud. 
We refuse to cry. 
We drift back
to the highway,
holding our fists
like rattles,
shaking them
like bones. 
IX.  Confessions of the Highway/The Hermit Speaks 
I know the rituals, the spells of grapes,
the ceremonies of tomatoes, celery, and rice.
I know the color of wind dressed for fiesta,
and the names of carnivals in Spanish and Japanese.
I am familiar with the determination of campesinos
who migrate up and down the stretch of the state
in search of crops ready for harvest.
It’s all a dull ache in my back,
small cuts on the throats of my fingers,
and the alkali of a dry lake in my lungs.
For me, the oracle of the giant orange
always predicts good fortune,
yet, it never comes true.
My stomach is full of sand and tar,
a little bit of paint, a few crickets.
I stand in swampwater up to my hips,
and the stink of rotting figs
escapes my armpits in small brown clouds.
Scrub oak and tumbleweed sprout from my scalp,
make a small grove behind my left ear.
I don’t know why sparrows and starlings
refuse to approach me, to take the grass seed
tucked in the cuffs of my trousers.
Maybe it’s the stain of asphalt around my ankles,
this copper sheen of sweat on my back.
Sometimes, when the valley heat
makes the bones in my feet
start to hiss and burn,
the desire to escape comes over me again.
I can’t help it.
My arms pull down a few telephone posts,
my shoulders churn against the bindings.
I feel myself wanting to sit up,
begin to walk again, and thresh my way
across rice fields and acres of alfalfa.
For once I’d like to lift my face
straight above Shasta into the sky,
shout in unison with thunder,
roar with the assurance of Santana wind,
leap out of these bonds of copper and steel,
slough off this skin of cement,
and walk south or north or even west
into the weather and the sea.


^^EOP^^

A new volcano has erupted,
the papers say, and last week I was reading   
where some ship saw an island being born:   
at first a breath of steam, ten miles away;   
and then a black fleck—basalt, probably—
rose in the mate’s binoculars
and caught on the horizon like a fly.
They named it. But my poor old island’s still   
un-rediscovered, un-renamable.
None of the books has ever got it right. 
Well, I had fifty-two
miserable, small volcanoes I could climb   
with a few slithery strides—
volcanoes dead as ash heaps.
I used to sit on the edge of the highest one   
and count the others standing up,
naked and leaden, with their heads blown off.   
I’d think that if they were the size   
I thought volcanoes should be, then I had   
become a giant;
and if I had become a giant,
I couldn’t bear to think what size   
the goats and turtles were,
or the gulls, or the overlapping rollers   
—a glittering hexagon of rollers   
closing and closing in, but never quite,   
glittering and glittering, though the sky   
was mostly overcast. 
My island seemed to be
a sort of cloud-dump. All the hemisphere’s   
left-over clouds arrived and hung
above the craters—their parched throats   
were hot to touch.
Was that why it rained so much?
And why sometimes the whole place hissed?   
The turtles lumbered by, high-domed,   
hissing like teakettles.
(And I’d have given years, or taken a few,   
for any sort of kettle, of course.)
The folds of lava, running out to sea,
would hiss. I’d turn. And then they’d prove   
to be more turtles.
The beaches were all lava, variegated,   
black, red, and white, and gray;
the marbled colors made a fine display.   
And I had waterspouts. Oh,
half a dozen at a time, far out,
they’d come and go, advancing and retreating,   
their heads in cloud, their feet in moving patches   
of scuffed-up white.
Glass chimneys, flexible, attenuated,   
sacerdotal beings of glass ... I watched   
the water spiral up in them like smoke.   
Beautiful, yes, but not much company. 
I often gave way to self-pity.
“Do I deserve this? I suppose I must.
I wouldn’t be here otherwise. Was there   
a moment when I actually chose this?
I don’t remember, but there could have been.”   
What’s wrong about self-pity, anyway?
With my legs dangling down familiarly   
over a crater’s edge, I told myself
“Pity should begin at home.” So the more   
pity I felt, the more I felt at home. 
The sun set in the sea; the same odd sun   
rose from the sea,
and there was one of it and one of me.   
The island had one kind of everything:   
one tree snail, a bright violet-blue
with a thin shell, crept over everything,   
over the one variety of tree,
a sooty, scrub affair.
Snail shells lay under these in drifts   
and, at a distance,
you’d swear that they were beds of irises.   
There was one kind of berry, a dark red.   
I tried it, one by one, and hours apart.   
Sub-acid, and not bad, no ill effects;   
and so I made home-brew. I’d drink   
the awful, fizzy, stinging stuff
that went straight to my head
and play my home-made flute
(I think it had the weirdest scale on earth)   
and, dizzy, whoop and dance among the goats.   
Home-made, home-made! But aren’t we all?   
I felt a deep affection for
the smallest of my island industries.   
No, not exactly, since the smallest was   
a miserable philosophy. 
Because I didn’t know enough.
Why didn’t I know enough of something?   
Greek drama or astronomy? The books   
I’d read were full of blanks;
the poems—well, I tried
reciting to my iris-beds,
“They flash upon that inward eye,
which is the bliss ...” The bliss of what?   
One of the first things that I did
when I got back was look it up. 
The island smelled of goat and guano.   
The goats were white, so were the gulls,   
and both too tame, or else they thought   
I was a goat, too, or a gull. Baa, baa, baa and shriek, shriek, shriek,
baa ... shriek ... 

^^EOP^^

The smell of snow, stinging in nostrils as the wind lifts it from a beach
Eve-shuttering, mixed with sand, or when snow lies under the street lamps and on all
And the air is emptied to an uplifting gassiness
That turns lungs to winter waterwings, buoying, and the bright white night
Freezes in sight a lapse of waves, balsamic, salty, unexpected:   
Hours after swimming, sitting thinking biting at a hangnail
And the taste of the—to your eyes—invisible crystals irradiates the world
“The sea is salt”   
“And so am I”
“Don’t bite your nails”
                              and the metal flavor of a nail—are these brads?—
Taken with a slight spitting motion from between teeth and whanged into place
(Boards and sawdust) and the nail set is ridged with cold
Permanently as marble, always degrees cooler than the rooms of air it lies in
Felt as you lay your cheek upon the counter on which sits a blue-banded cup
A counter of condensed wintry exhalations glittering infinitesimally   
A promise, late on a broiling day in late September, of the cold kiss   
Of marble sheets to one who goes barefoot quickly in the snow and early   
Only so far as the ash can—bang, dump—and back and slams the door:
Too cold to get up though at the edges of the blinds the sky   
Shows blue as flames that break on a red sea in which black coals float:   
Pebbles in a pocket embed the seam with grains of sand
Which, as they will, have found their way into a pattern between foot and bedfoot
“A place for everything and everything in its place” how wasteful, how wrong
It seems when snow in fat, hand-stuffed flakes falls slow and steady in the sea
“Now you see it, now you don’t” the waves growl as they grind ashore and roll out
At your feet (in boots) a Christmas tree naked of needles
Still wound with swags of tarnishing tinsel, faintly alarming as the thought
Of damp electricity or sluggish lightning and for your health desiring pains
The wind awards: Chapped Lips: on which to rub Time’s latest acquisition
Tinned, dowel shaped and inappropriately flavored sheep wool fat   
A greasy sense-eclipsing fog “I can’t see
Without my glasses” “You certainly can’t see with them all steamed up   
Like that. Pull over, park and wipe them off.” The thunder of a summer’s day
Rolls down the shimmering blacktop and mowed grass juice thickens the air
Like “Stir until it coats the spoon, remove from heat, let cool and chill”   
Like this, graying up for more snow, maybe, in which a small flock   
Of—sparrows?—small, anyway, dust-kitty-colored birds fly up   
On a dotted diagonal and there, ah, is the answer:
Starlings, bullies of birdland, lousing up
The pecking order, respecters of no rights (what bird is) unloved (oh?)   
Not so likeable as some: that’s temperate enough and the temperature   
Drops to rise to snowability of a softness even in its scent of roses   
Made of untinted butter frosting: Happy Name Day, Blue Jay, staggering   
On slow-up wings into the shrunk into itself from cold forsythia snarl   
And above these thoughts there waves another tangle but one parched with heat
And not with cold although the heat is on because of cold settled all   
About as though, swimming under water, in clearly fishy water, you   
Inhaled and found one could and live and also found you altogether   
Did not like it, January, laid out on a bed of ice, disgorging
February, shaped like a flounder, and March with her steel head pocketbook,
And April, goofy and under-dressed and with a loud laugh, and May   
Who will of course be voted Miss Best Liked (she expects it),
And June, with a toothpaste smile, fresh from her flea bath, and gross July,
Flexing itself, and steamy August, with thighs and eyes to match, and September
Diving into blue October, dour November, and deadly dull December which now
And then with a surprised blank look produces from its hand the ace of trumps
Or sets within the ice white hairline of a new moon the gibbous rest:   
Global, blue, Columbian, a blue dull definite and thin as the first day
Of February when, in the steamed and freezing capital cash built   
Without a plan to be its own best monument its skyline set in stacks
Like poker chips (signed “Autodidact”), at the crux of a view there crosses
A flatcar-trailer piled with five of the cheaper sort of yachts, tarpaulined,
Plus one youth in purple pants, a maid in her uniform and an “It’s not real
Anything” Cossack hat and coat, a bus one-quarter full of strangers and   
The other familiar fixings of lengthening short days: “He’s outgrown them
Before you can turn around” and see behind you the landscape of the past
Where beached boats bask and terraced cliffs are hung with oranges
Among dark star-gleaming leaves, and, descending the dizzying rough stairs
Littered with goat turd beads—such packaging—you—he—she—
One—someone—stops to break off a bit of myrtle and recite all the lines
Of Goethe that come back, and those in French, “Connais-tu ... ?” the air
Fills with chalk dust from banged erasers, behind the February dunes   
Ice boats speed and among the reeds there winds a little frozen stream   
Where kids in kapok ice-skate and play at Secret City as the sun
Sets before dinner, the snow on fields turns pink and under the hatched ice
The water slides darkly and over it a never before seen liquefaction of the sun
In a chemical yellow greener than sulphur a flash of petroleum by-product
Unbelievable, unwanted and as lovely as though someone you knew all your life
Said the one inconceivable thing and then went on washing dishes: the sky
Flows with impersonal passion and loosening jet trails (eyes tearing from the cold)
And on the beach, between foam frozen in a thick scalloped edging so like
Weird cheek-mottling pillowcase embroidery, on the water-darkened sand the waves
Keep free of frost, a gull strangles on a length of nylon fishline and the dog
Trots proudly off, tail held high, to bury a future dinner among cut grass on a dune:
The ice boats furl their sails and all pile into cars and go off to the super market
Its inviting foods and cleansers sold under tunes with sealed in memory-flavor
“Hot House Rhubarb” “White Rock Girl” “Citrus Futures” “Cheap Bitter Beans” and
In its parking lot vast as the kiss to which is made the most complete surrender
In a setting of leaves, backs of stores, a house on a rise admired for being
Somewhat older than some others (prettier, too?) a man in a white apron embraces a car
Briefly in the cold with his eyes as one might hug oneself for warmth for love
—What a paint job, smooth as an eggplant; what a meaty chest, smooth as an eggplant
—Is it too much to ask your car to understand you? the converse isn’t and the sky
Maps out new roads so that, driving at right angles to the wind, clouds in ranks
Contrive in diminishing perspective a part of a picture postcard of a painting
Over oak scrub where a filling station has: gas, a locked toilet (to keep dirt in)
A busted soda pop machine, no maps and “I couldn’t tell you thet” so   
The sky empties itself to a color, there, where yesterday’s puddle   
Offers its hospitality to people-trash and nature-trash in tans and silvers   
And black grit like that in corners of a room in this or that cheap dump   
Where the ceiling light burns night and day and we stare at or into each   
Other’s eyes in hope the other reads there what he reads: snow, wind   
Lifted; black water, slashed with white; and that which is, which is beyond
Happiness or love or mixed with them or more than they or less, unchanging change,
“Look,” the ocean said (it was tumbled, like our sheets), “look in my eyes”

What is Hope? A smiling rainbow       Children follow through the wet; ’Tis not here, still yonder, yonder:       Never urchin found it yet.  What is Life? A thawing iceboard       On a sea with sunny shore;— Gay we sail; it melts beneath us;       We are sunk, and seen no more.  What is Man? A foolish baby,       Vainly strives, and fights, and frets; Demanding all, deserving nothing;—       One small grave is what he gets.

We thought it would come, we thought the Germans would come,   
were almost certain they would. I was thirty-two,
the youngest assistant curator in the country.
I had some good ideas in those days. 
Well, what we did was this. We had boxes   
precisely built to every size of canvas.
We put the boxes in the basement and waited. 
When word came that the Germans were coming in,   
we got each painting put in the proper box
and out of Leningrad in less than a week.
They were stored somewhere in southern Russia. 
But what we did, you see, besides the boxes   
waiting in the basement, which was fine,
a grand idea, you’ll agree, and it saved the art—
but what we did was leave the frames hanging,   
so after the war it would be a simple thing   
to put the paintings back where they belonged. 
Nothing will seem surprised or sad again   
compared to those imperious, vacant frames. 
Well, the staff stayed on to clean the rubble
after the daily bombardments. We didn’t dream—
You know it lasted nine hundred days.
Much of the roof was lost and snow would lie   
sometimes a foot deep on this very floor,
but the walls stood firm and hardly a frame fell. 
Here is the story, now, that I want to tell you.   
Early one day, a dark December morning,
we came on three young soldiers waiting outside,   
pacing and swinging their arms against the cold.   
They told us this: in three homes far from here   
all dreamed of one day coming to Leningrad   
to see the Hermitage, as they supposed   
every Soviet citizen dreamed of doing.   
Now they had been sent to defend the city,   
a turn of fortune the three could hardly believe. 
I had to tell them there was nothing to see
but hundreds and hundreds of frames where the paintings had hung. 
“Please, sir,” one of them said, “let us see them.” 
And so we did. It didn’t seem any stranger   
than all of us being here in the first place,   
inside such a building, strolling in snow. 
We led them around most of the major rooms,   
what they could take the time for, wall by wall.   
Now and then we stopped and tried to tell them
part of what they would see if they saw the paintings.   
I told them how those colors would come together,   
described a brushstroke here, a dollop there,   
mentioned a model and why she seemed to pout   
and why this painter got the roses wrong. 
The next day a dozen waited for us,
then thirty or more, gathered in twos and threes.   
Each of us took a group in a different direction:   
Castagno, Caravaggio, Brueghel, Cézanne, Matisse,   
Orozco, Manet, da Vinci, Goya, Vermeer,
Picasso, Uccello, your Whistler, Wood, and Gropper.   
We pointed to more details about the paintings,   
I venture to say, than if we had had them there,   
some unexpected use of line or light,
balance or movement, facing the cluster of faces   
the same way we’d done it every morning   
before the war, but then we didn’t pay
so much attention to what we talked about.
People could see for themselves. As a matter of fact   
we’d sometimes said our lines as if they were learned   
out of a book, with hardly a look at the paintings. 
But now the guide and the listeners paid attention   
to everything—the simple differences
between the first and post-impressionists,
romantic and heroic, shade and shadow. 
Maybe this was a way to forget the war
a little while. Maybe more than that.
Whatever it was, the people continued to come.   
It came to be called The Unseen Collection. 
Here. Here is the story I want to tell you. 
Slowly, blind people began to come.
A few at first then more of them every morning,   
some led and some alone, some swaying a little.
They leaned and listened hard, they screwed their faces,   
they seemed to shift their eyes, those that had them,   
to see better what was being said.
And a cock of the head. My God, they paid attention. 
After the siege was lifted and the Germans left
and the roof was fixed and the paintings were in their places,   
the blind never came again. Not like before.
This seems strange, but what I think it was,
they couldn’t see the paintings anymore.
They could still have listened, but the lectures became   
a little matter-of-fact. What can I say?
Confluences come when they will and they go away.

Scribe out of work
At a loss for words
Not his to begin with,
The man life passed by
Stands at the window
Biding his time

Time and again
And now once more
I climb these stairs
Unlock this door—
No name where I live
Alone in my lair
With one bone to pick
And no time to spare

Fathers are invariably great nuisances on the stage, and always have to give the hero or heroine a long explanation of what was done before the curtain rose, usually commencing with “It is now nineteen years, my dear child, since ...” etc., etc.
—Charles Dickens 



There might be a planet. Before that,
though, there would have been a gas that coalesced
into a planet . . . as, before that, there were dots of flux
and energy that hadn’t yet declared themselves
in concert. There’s always “before”: there's more
each minute, more each person, yes and every one
of its smallest, irreducible subparticles—which I name
the “beforeon”—is exerting force on us
that’s surely time’s own version of gravity: its purpose
is to tug, and to remind us. In the house of second marriages, 
it causes the man to do what he and the woman had promised
they never would: one night while she’s asleep, he snoops
her bureau for telltale relics of the mysterious Mr.
Number One. And why, or even what
he hopes to find, he couldn’t clearly say: a letter? photo?
sex toy?—something, some objectified gossip, a fossil
of bygone love. Essentially, we make of our own psyches
a bureau and pay a shrink to snoop; as for the moment
when our neural linkage first began to form,
as for the flavor of the fluids in the womb. . . we’re all 
amnesiacs: and our earliest self, just like the universe’s
earliest being, is a “phantom limb” with the faintest
mnemonic of starbursts in an otherwise chill void. I have
a friend D____ L____ (this poem is hers) who, orphaned
as a newborn, is devoted to learning her origin
as doggedly as any cosmologist tracks light to its source, although her search (when not pure Internet) is more a matter
of tape-recording the beer-sour stories in sailor bars,
of sifting ashy memories in nursing homes,
one backwards inch of plotline at a time. And yet somebody 
else is waking up this morning with the need
to be detached from any history,
to stand here like a person in a play who enters
onstage from a pool of perfect blankness. Then,
of course, he can start over, minute-zero-of-year-zero,
unbesmirched. We could have told him that he’d be this
anguished—sneaking in her drawer, below those folded
pastel lozenges of lingerie, uncovering the one thing
that could ruin them. Now he wants only to float (who doesn't, sometimes?) in an anti-world: appealing, but 
illusory. We can’t unmoor ourselves from linearity,
no more than any one of us can be a human being
unconnected to a genome—and in fact, no more
than Mama-All-of-Time-and-Space-Herself (I mean
the cosmos) can unwrap her vasty body from its own
twelve million years of Big Bang “background radiation”
so it wafts—a tossed off, filmy scarf—far elsewhere.
No; there isn’t any “elsewhere.” When we sleep
or simply deepen into quietude enough, the voices
come—the rhythmic, grave, ancestral murmur, 
a woman bearing a ritual clamshell bowl . . .
a man with a done-deal sales contract . . . whispers,
knuckle-rap, cleared throats. . . . Her great-grandfather,
D____ L____ has uncovered, was a lector—a reader they used
to relieve the tedium of the leaf rollers’ shifts
in cigar manufactories. Shakespeare, Dickens,
union tracts, love letters, family diaries . . . . He’s
walking through the tobacco aroma; he’s setting his text
on his easel; and the story—the only story we know,
the story of Before—is recited.

You do not do, you do not do   
Any more, black shoe
In which I have lived like a foot   
For thirty years, poor and white,   
Barely daring to breathe or Achoo. 
Daddy, I have had to kill you.   
You died before I had time——
Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,   
Ghastly statue with one gray toe   
Big as a Frisco seal 
And a head in the freakish Atlantic   
Where it pours bean green over blue   
In the waters off beautiful Nauset.   
I used to pray to recover you.
Ach, du. 
In the German tongue, in the Polish town   
Scraped flat by the roller
Of wars, wars, wars.
But the name of the town is common.   
My Polack friend 
Says there are a dozen or two.   
So I never could tell where you   
Put your foot, your root,
I never could talk to you.
The tongue stuck in my jaw. 
It stuck in a barb wire snare.   
Ich, ich, ich, ich,
I could hardly speak.
I thought every German was you.   
And the language obscene 
An engine, an engine
Chuffing me off like a Jew.
A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.   
I began to talk like a Jew.
I think I may well be a Jew. 
The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna   
Are not very pure or true.
With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck   
And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack
I may be a bit of a Jew. 
I have always been scared of you,
With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.   
And your neat mustache
And your Aryan eye, bright blue.
Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You—— 
Not God but a swastika
So black no sky could squeak through.   
Every woman adores a Fascist,   
The boot in the face, the brute   
Brute heart of a brute like you. 
You stand at the blackboard, daddy,   
In the picture I have of you,
A cleft in your chin instead of your foot   
But no less a devil for that, no not   
Any less the black man who 
Bit my pretty red heart in two.
I was ten when they buried you.   
At twenty I tried to die
And get back, back, back to you.
I thought even the bones would do. 
But they pulled me out of the sack,   
And they stuck me together with glue.   
And then I knew what to do.
I made a model of you,
A man in black with a Meinkampf look 
And a love of the rack and the screw.   
And I said I do, I do.
So daddy, I’m finally through.
The black telephone’s off at the root,   
The voices just can’t worm through. 
If I’ve killed one man, I’ve killed two——
The vampire who said he was you   
And drank my blood for a year,
Seven years, if you want to know.
Daddy, you can lie back now. 
There’s a stake in your fat black heart   
And the villagers never liked you.
They are dancing and stamping on you.   
They always knew it was you.
Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.

The day the war against Iraq begins
I’m photographing the yellow daffodils
With their outstretched arms and ruffled cups
Blowing in the wind of Jesus Green 
Edging the lush grassy moving river
Along with the swans and ducks
Under a soft March Cambridge sky
Embellishing the earth like a hand 
Starting to illustrate a children’s book
Where people in light clothes come out
To play, to frisk and run about
With their lovers, friends, animals, and children 
As down every stony back road of history
They’ve always done in the peaceful springs
—Which in a sense is also hell because
The daffodils do look as if they dance 
And make some of us in the park want to dance
And breathe deeply and I know that
Being able to eat and incorporate beauty like this
I am privileged and by that token can 
Taste pain, roll it on my tongue, it’s good
The cruel wars are good the stupidity is good,
The primates hiding in their caves are very good,
They do their best, which explains poetry. 
What explains poetry is that life is hard
But better than the alternatives,
The no and the nothing. Look at this light
And color, a splash of brilliant yellow 
Punctuating an emerald text, white swans
And mottled brown ducks floating quietly along
Whole and alive, like an untorn language
That lacks nothing, that excludes 
Nothing. Period. Don’t you think
It is our business to defend it
Even the day our masters start a war?
To defend the day we see the daffodils?

We have cried often when we have given them the little victualling we
had to give them; we had to shake them, and they have fallen to sleep
with the victuals in their mouths many a time.
(parent of children working at a textile mill, to an
1832 Parliamentary inquiry into child employment)



1. 
They cry for children too tired to cry for themselves,
daughters twelve, eleven, eight—eyes
shutting down as a grate’s banked coals shut down
at midnight, in the rising damp called ‘home.’
Too tired to eat after eighteen hours feeding
looms whose steel teeth grind insatiably,
the girls will be offered up again at dawn. 
Yet they are the lucky ones, to work where skylights
hold swatches of the unaffordable blue.
Imagine these girls’ mine-trapped cousins, hauling
black rocks on sledges up tunnels of black air:
half-undressed, belted, harnessed, saturated
with the oil-blackened water they crawl through
pumping ‘the lifeblood of British industry.’ 
Flogged for talking, Margaret Comeley, aged
nine, can sometimes close her mouth around
a piece of muffin—if she manages
to keep it from the rats, ‘so ravenous
they eat the corks out of our oil-flasks.’
Sarah Gooder fills her mouth with song
‘when I’ve light, but not in the dark; I dare not then.’   2. 
Here is a working girl so filled with light
she is pure song: her sun-bright bodice shines
in counterpoint with her blue overskirt,
and, from her forehead’s crescent of white linen,
tapering light blazes a white path
down arms and wrists to folds of spread blue cloth,
like moonlight piloting the tide’s refrains. 
A Dutch milkmaid, Tanneke Everpoel,
lucky enough to live in the Delft house
where Vermeer’s eye and brush could catch the spill
of morning light as her brief peacefulness
brimmed over, serves here as a celebrant—
bread heaped up on the altar-like table,
wine transubstantiated into milk 
whose brilliance seems the source of the room’s light
she pours forever from the earthenware’s
black core. His pose; yet—all hers—underneath it
(and signalled in her fixed eyes’ unconcern
for the beholder) such complete immersion
in what she does, that she is all she does
and it is she, this offering-up of day. 
And he? When he was forty, the Sun King
invaded Holland. No one wanted art.
In debt to his baker for three years’ worth of bread,
Vermeer, according to his widow, falling
‘into a frenzy,’ passed ‘from being healthy’
in ‘a day or a day and a half ... to being dead,’
‘the very great burden of his children ... so taken to heart.’   3. 
Knowing the earth is closer to the sun
in winter won’t revive the street person
sleeping towards cold death in a bus shelter.
Bread in a painting won’t cure stomach ache.
So Margaret dragged her great burden of coal
while Sarah sat terrified in the dark,
and neither knew Vermeer’s poised working girl, 
broke bread with her, shared her breaking light.
The painting stood by, helpless to save them
or him, and looking at it now cannot
help anyone. Yet, it can cry for them,
as parents take their children’s grief to heart:
the beads of salt, shimmering on the bread
like diamonds, can be tears the two girls shed 
down where no light sang their preciousness.
The cradled pitcher’s brim can be their hearth,
since it (and not the sky’s cold mine of stars)
pours out what cannot shelter us, but feeds
a hunger no daily bread can fill: for light—
light that, like coal, comes from our earth; hunger
that, unlike grief, is inexhaustible.

Oh, there are timesWhen all this fret and tumult that we hearDo seem more stale than to the sexton’s ear
 His own dull chimes.
  Ding dong! ding dong!The world is in a simmer like a seaOver a pent volcano,—woe is me
 All the day long!
  From crib to shroud!Nurse o’er our cradles screameth lullaby,And friends in boots tramp round us as we die,
 Snuffling aloud.
  At morning’s callThe small-voiced pug-dog welcomes in the sun,And flea-bit mongrels, wakening one by one,
 Give answer all.
  When evening dimDraws round us, then the lonely caterwaul,Tart solo, sour duet, and general squall,—
 These are our hymn.
  Women, with tonguesLike polar needles, ever on the jar;Men, plugless word-spouts, whose deep fountains are
 Within their lungs.
  Children, with drumsStrapped round them by the fond paternal ass;Peripatetics with a blade of grass
 Between their thumbs.
  Vagrants, whose artsHave caged some devil in their mad machine,Which grinding, squeaks, with husky groans between,
 Come out by starts.
  Cockneys that killThin horses of a Sunday,—men, with clams,Hoarse as young bisons roaring for their dams
 From hill to hill.
  Soldiers, with guns,Making a nuisance of the blessed air,Child-crying bellman, children in despair,
 Screeching for buns.
  Storms, thunders, waves!Howl, crash, and bellow till ye get your fill;Ye sometimes rest; men never can be still
 But in their graves.

Hark how the Mower Damon sung, With love of Juliana stung! While everything did seem to paint The scene more fit for his complaint. Like her fair eyes the day was fair, But scorching like his am’rous care. Sharp like his scythe his sorrow was, And withered like his hopes the grass.  ‘Oh what unusual heats are here, Which thus our sunburned meadows sear! The grasshopper its pipe gives o’er; And hamstringed frogs can dance no more. But in the brook the green frog wades; And grasshoppers seek out the shades. Only the snake, that kept within, Now glitters in its second skin.  ‘This heat the sun could never raise, Nor Dog Star so inflame the days. It from an higher beauty grow’th, Which burns the fields and mower both: Which mads the dog, and makes the sun Hotter than his own Phaëton. Not July causeth these extremes, But Juliana’s scorching beams.  ‘Tell me where I may pass the fires Of the hot day, or hot desires. To what cool cave shall I descend, Or to what gelid fountain bend? Alas! I look for ease in vain, When remedies themselves complain. No moisture but my tears do rest, Nor cold but in her icy breast.  ‘How long wilt thou, fair shepherdess, Esteem me, and my presents less? To thee the harmless snake I bring, Disarmèd of its teeth and sting; To thee chameleons, changing hue, And oak leaves tipped with honey dew. Yet thou, ungrateful, hast not sought Nor what they are, nor who them brought.  ‘I am the Mower Damon, known Through all the meadows I have mown. On me the morn her dew distills Before her darling daffodils. And, if at noon my toil me heat, The sun himself licks off my sweat. While, going home, the evening sweet In cowslip-water bathes my feet.  ‘What, though the piping shepherd stock The plains with an unnumbered flock, This scythe of mine discovers wide More ground than all his sheep do hide. With this the golden fleece I shear Of all these closes every year. And though in wool more poor than they, Yet am I richer far in hay.  ‘Nor am I so deformed to sight, If in my scythe I lookèd right; In which I see my picture done, As in a crescent moon the sun. The deathless fairies take me oft To lead them in their dances soft: And, when I tune myself to sing, About me they contract their ring.  ‘How happy might I still have mowed, Had not Love here his thistles sowed! But now I all the day complain, Joining my labour to my pain; And with my scythe cut down the grass, Yet still my grief is where it was: But, when the iron blunter grows, Sighing, I whet my scythe and woes.’  While thus he threw his elbow round, Depopulating all the ground, And, with his whistling scythe, does cut Each stroke between the earth and root, The edgèd steel by careless chance Did into his own ankle glance; And there among the grass fell down, By his own scythe, the Mower mown.  ‘Alas!’ said he, ‘these hurts are slight To those that die by love’s despite. With shepherd’s-purse, and clown’s-all-heal, The blood I staunch, and wound I seal. Only for him no cure is found, Whom Juliana’s eyes do wound. ’Tis death alone that this must do: For Death thou art a Mower too.’

Water sheets on the old stone of the cellar walls,
trickles out over the floor into little deltas of mud,
worse every year, so that now I can see daylight
at the footings, and upstairs the floors sometimes
tremble and the clothes go damp in the closets. And sometimes
I think the whole place is about to come down, and have begun 
to dream at night of moving, unaccountably sad
to think of leaving this house which has possessed me now
for eighteen years, in which one of us has died
and two been born, for all its elegance of detail most everything
not right in it, or long gone bad, nothing
ever done which should have been, one hundred years
and more of water rancid in the cellars, moldings
never finished or else mitred crookedly, all 
the small and growing energies of dirt and rot
wherever we care to look, whenever we do. And we do.
But I dream also of the pine grove of my planting,
which I know I love and which is the green truth
of this place: in one day ten years ago
I dug fourteen small trees, wrapped the roots
in burlap, dragged them down from the top ridge
of the hill, spaced them carefully, watered
them each day for one whole season. Now 
they are twenty feet high, thick roots
already at the cellar wall, vigorous and loud
even in little winds, only the hemlock
mournful and reluctant to do much in the way
of increasing itself. But it is clear
that if I do not freely leave this place,
it will leave me—though, as Ray Reynolds says,
digging at a powdery floor joist with his knife,
there may be more here than I think, better
than a two-by-six at least; and his blade slides
two inches in and stops at what he calls
the heartwood, meaning, as I take it, at the wood
which has not yet given way.

The damselfly folds its wings
over its body when at rest. Captured,
it should not be killed
in cyanide, but allowed to die
slowly: then the colors,
especially the reds and blues,
will last. In the hand
it crushes easily into a rosy
slime. Its powers of flight
are weak. The trout 
feeds on the living damselfly.
The trout leaps up from the water,
and if there is sun you see
the briefest shiver of gold,
and then the river again.         
When the trout dies
it turns its white belly
to the mirror of the sky.
The heron fishes for the trout 
in the gravelly shallows on the far
side of the stream. The heron
is the exact blue of the shadows
the sun makes of trees on water.
When you hold the heron most clearly
in your eye, you are least certain
it is there. When the blue heron dies,
it lies beyond reach
on the far side of the river.

...at the still point, there the dance is.
—T. S. Eliot



The errand into the maze,
Emblem, the heel’s blow upon space,
Speak of the need and order the dancer’s will.
But the dance is still. 
For a surmise of rest, over the flight of the dial,
Between shock of the fall, shock of repose,
The flesh in its time delivered itself to the trial,
And rose. 
Suffrance: the lapse, the pause,
Were the will of the dance—
The movement-to-be, charmed from the shifts of the chance,
Intent on its cause. 
And the terrible gift
Of the gaze, blind on its zenith, the wreath
Of the throat, the body’s unwearied uplift,
Unmaking and making its death, 
Were ripeness, and theme for return:
Were rest, in the durance of matter:
The sleep of the musing Begetter
And the poise in the urn.


^^EOP^^

Frame within frame, the evolving conversation   
is dancelike, as though two could play   
at improvising snowflakes’
six-feather-vaned evanescence,
no two ever alike. All process
and no arrival: the happier we are,
the less there is for memory to take hold of,   
or—memory being so largely a predilection   
for the exceptional—come to a halt   
in front of. But finding, one evening   
on a street not quite familiar,
inside a gated
November-sodden garden, a building   
of uncertain provenance,
peering into whose vestibule we were   
arrested—a frame within a frame,   
a lozenge of impeccable clarity—
by the reflection, no, not
of our two selves, but of
dancers exercising in a mirror,
at the center
of that clarity, what we saw
was not stillness
but movement: the perfection
of memory consisting, it would seem,   
in the never-to-be-completed.
We saw them mirroring themselves,   
never guessing the vestibule
that defined them, frame within frame,   
contained two other mirrors.

Foreword to “Dancing on the Grave of a Son of a Bitch”

This poem is more properly a “dance poem” than a song or chant because the element of repetition is created by movements of language rather than duplicating words and sounds. However, it is in the spirit of ritual recitation that I wrote it/ a performance to drive away bad spirits perhaps.

The story behind the poem is this: a man and woman who have been living together for some time separate. Part of the pain of separation involves possessions which they had shared. They both angrily believe they should have what they want. She asks for some possession and he denies her the right to it. She replies that she gave him money for a possession which he has and therefore should have what she wants now. He replies that she has forgotten that for the number of years they lived together he never charged her rent and if he had she would now owe him $7,000.

She is appalled that he equates their history with a sum of money. She is even more furious to realize that this sum of money represents the entire rent on the apartment and implies that he should not have paid anything at all. She is furious. She kills him mentally. Once and for all she decides she is well rid of this man and that she shouldn’t feel sad at their parting. She decides to prove to herself that she’s glad he’s gone from her life. With joy she will dance on all the bad memories of their life together. 

 
for my motorcycle betrayer



God damn it,
at last I am going to dance on your grave,
old man;
            you’ve stepped on my shadow once too often,
you’ve been unfaithful to me with other women,
women so cheap and insipid it psychs me out to think I might
ever
be put
in the same category with them;
you’ve left me alone so often that I might as well have been
a homesteader in Alaska
these past years;
and you’ve left me, thrown me out of your life
often enough
that I might as well be a newspaper,
differently discarded each day.
Now you’re gone for good
and I don’t know why
but your leaving actually made me as miserable
as an earthworm with no
earth,
but now I’ve crawled out of the ground where you stomped me
and I gradually stand taller and taller each
day.
I have learned to sing new songs,
and as I sing,
I’m going to dance on your grave
because you are
          dead
          dead
          dead
under the earth with the rest of the shit,
I’m going to plant deadly nightshade
on your grassy mound
and make sure a hemlock tree starts growing there.
Henbane is too good for you,
but I’ll let a bit grow there for good measure
because we want to dance,
we want to sing,
we want to throw this old man
to the wolves,
but they are too beautiful for him, singing in harmony
with each other.
                   So some white wolves and I
will sing on your grave, old man
and dance for the joy of your death.
“Is this an angry statement?”
                            “No, it is a statement of joy.”
“Will the sun shine again?”
                            "Yes,
                            yes,
                            yes,”
                            because I’m going to dance dance dance
Duncan’s measure, and Pindar’s tune,
Lorca’s cadence, and Creeley’s hum,
Stevens’ sirens and Williams’ little Morris dance,
oh, the poets will call the tune,
and I will dance, dance, dance
on your grave, grave, grave,
because you’re a sonofabitch, a sonofabitch,
and you tried to do me in,
but you cant cant cant.
You were a liar in a way that only I know:
            You ride a broken motorcycle,
            You speak a dead language
            You are a bad plumber,
            And you write with an inkless pen.
You were mean to me,
and I’ve survived,
God damn you,
at last I am going to dance on your grave,
old man,
I’m going to learn every traditional dance,
every measure,
and dance dance dance on your grave
                                                    one step
for every time
you done me wrong.

The way calcium grows 
all by itself into bone, microscopic
fraction attaches itself to fraction 
or clouds crystallize, or blizzards congeal into hard
ice on aluminum wings, 
even the astronauts’ bodysuits can’t cover up
the sheer strangeness of it, the extraordinary being-here 
or anywhere, the skin of the plane could easily peel back
like an ear of corn and then what’s to be seen but who, me? 
the live, disintegrating,
terrified Barbie Doll asks, stuffed into her jeans 
like a stick of butter, her neat, pointed feet dangerously
stuck into sky... 
but still, teetering down the aisle
if anyone bumps her she glares,  This Is My Territory, 
this little packet of a hundred and twenty-two
pounds more or less says Move it, Babe, 
one minute the cold kitchen, next minute Miami Beach,
digging into the sand beside the violent- 
ly green sea, droplets of Almighty coconut oil
under the crisp tang of salt drizzle and lick 
all over its bare, lusciously bronzed congregation
of too too solid— 
No! Never in this world, the greedy molecules hiss 
as the plane turns inland, the woman returns to her seat
past all the other anonymous collections of cells, 
some snoring, some fussing with their kids,
one bent over a laptop, another staring 
straight at her for a second, with X-ray
exhausted eyes peering, then swiveling away 
as if they’d known each other before, fellow crew members
from another planet, 
though the woman thinks of herself only on Main Street—my
my what an arrangement of chromosomes collected 
who knows why—up here among streaked, boiling clouds
with the plane speeding through them, how  unexpected it is, how far the body travels
from its babyhood, locked in its charged circuits 
she thinks about edges, the leathery sunburned skin
flaking off, in filmy shreds, 
sound barriers breaking away from her but here she still is
for this one second fixed, eyes sticking out of the top of her face 
like the glint of a buried pin or the beak
of a mother robin in the nest 
she made for herself: 
with earth losing its outer walls
twig by twig, what is this naked fork quivering 
in the middle of Whose consciousness 
she keeps wondering, whizzing across the face
of an electric cloud chamber, 
here all I am
is falling, in the tight ship of the diminished, 
in hot chips of pure
ignorant energy fizzing around some magnet, 
some lucky iron only
imagination can count on, 
trembling, gritting her teeth on the thread
of an end she can’t know,  Please, Someone, materialize me
in arms I can love always

^^EOP^^

From the first, I was too reluctant, achieving by dribs and drabs,
Happy to linger in shallows while others jackknifed from cliffs, wrong
To exact perfection from a sad piece or add notes to a proven tune;
But ever the classicist:
                                     in swimming lessons, slowest to learn;
In fights, tentative, preferring the hammerlock to the jab and hook; cautious
In the earliest romances, choking in the clutch, fumbling the caress; or shy
Among the crew-cut Cupids bristling at the armory’s weekend dances;
But shifty in every game, keeping it close. Always holding still
And adjuring others to go slow
                                              until we leapt forward that night out of control
And pinned to the seats of Tyler Wilson’s outlandishly unstock Ford
While, from the opposite side of the valley, scalding in each curve, came the black din
And brunt of Sonny Walker’s highjacker Chevrolet, everyone screaming
And bearing down to be first across the bridge at Hurricane Creek. 
Many trophies show us frozen: a leg poised for the hurdle, an arm cocked for the unanswerable spike.
What I remember through the windshield’s splintering lens is time, a mailbox
Rushing by, the letters TURRENTINE,
                                                      then darkness rolling inside;
Though memory, at best, retrieves maybe six percent in studio light,
So even now I think we might have turned:
                                                               smart with his hands,
There is a kind of savior who blusters through the South, good with animals and machines,
Who surely somehow would have found a gap, through an open gate
Into a marshy cornfield  
                                    or up a logging road into a hillside wood.
At any rate, there is just a little while, shy of any bridge, just as judgment
Balances its two blind alternatives and a third accelerates head-on.
I’ve made a careful study: things that can only be accomplished in deep space,
In another language, in far history, at an almost incalculable speed. Courage is not included, or much foolishness.
They spin the purest glass, they split the atom, they speak with God. 
They make a sort of Teflon hip and attach it with metal screws,
Only the threads upbone keep stripping
                                                          so they have to operate
Again and again, and what she’s accomplished is more of a gait, really,
Than a walk, so when she moves toward me, across any room,
I think too much of my own will
                                                implicated in that dragging brace.
Each step is obviously trained, and the whole earned motion full
Of muscle, plastic, and bone
                                           is coordinated by nerves even the
Strictest dance does not require. She has said there is no fault,
But even in such talk,
                                  grace occurs as an accident someone caused.
If what I require is a thing too certain, braided from probabilities,
There is another thing
                                  articulated in the scars that saved her face—
And no right now in that night we were shaken and rolled like dice, no right to
Say this guilt to be alive is love, or the opposite of lucky is wrong.

from Sonnets, First Series                 VI
Dank fens of cedar; hemlock-branches grayWith trees and trail of mosses, wringing-wet;Beds of the black pitchpine in dead leaves setWhose wasted red has wasted to white away;Remnants of rain and droppings of decay, —Why hold ye so my heart, nor dimly letThrough your deep leaves the light of yesterday,The faded glimmer of a sunshine set?Is it that in your darkness, shut from strife,The bread of tears becomes the bread of life?Far from the roar of day, beneath your boughsFresh griefs beat tranquilly, and loves and vowsGrow green in your gray shadows, dearer farEven than all lovely lights and roses are?

‘What are the bugles blowin’ for?' said Files-on-Parade.   
‘To turn you out, to turn you out,’ the Colour-Sergeant said.
‘What makes you look so white, so white?’ said Files-on-Parade.
‘I’m dreadin’ what I’ve got to watch,’ the Colour-Sergeant said.
      For they’re hangin’ Danny Deever, you can hear the Dead March play,

‘What makes the rear-rank breathe so ’ard?’ said Files-on-Parade.
‘It’s bitter cold, it's bitter cold,’ the Colour-Sergeant said.
‘What makes that front-rank man fall down?’ said Files-on-Parade.
‘A touch o’ sun, a touch o’ sun,’ the Colour-Sergeant said.
      They are hangin’ Danny Deever, they are marchin’ of ’im round,

‘’Is cot was right-’and cot to mine,’ said Files-on-Parade.
‘’E’s sleepin’ out an’ far to-night,’ the Colour-Sergeant said.
‘I’ve drunk ’is beer a score o’ times,’ said Files-on-Parade.
‘’E’s drinkin’ bitter beer alone,’ the Colour-Sergeant said.
      They are hangin’ Danny Deever, you must mark ’im to ’is place,

‘What’s that so black agin the sun?’ said Files-on-Parade.   
‘It’s Danny fightin’ ’ard for life,’ the Colour-Sergeant said.   
‘What’s that that whimpers over’ead?’ said Files-on-Parade.
‘It’s Danny’s soul that’s passin’ now,’ the Colour-Sergeant said.
      For they’re done with Danny Deever, you can ’ear the quickstep play,
      The Regiment’s in column, an’ they’re marchin’ us away;
      Ho! the young recruits are shakin’, an’ they’ll want their beer to-day,
      After hangin’ Danny Deever in the mornin’!

If I when my wife is sleeping
and the baby and Kathleen
are sleeping
and the sun is a flame-white disc
in silken mists
above shining trees,—
if I in my north room
dance naked, grotesquely
before my mirror
waving my shirt round my head
and singing softly to myself:
“I am lonely, lonely.
I was born to be lonely,
I am best so!”
If I admire my arms, my face,
my shoulders, flanks, buttocks
against the yellow drawn shades,— 
Who shall say I am not
the happy genius of my household?

For Annie



You can come to me in the evening,
            with the fingers of former lovers
fastened in your hair and their ghost lips
            opening over your body,
They can be philosophers or musicians in long coats and colored shoes
and they can be smarter than I am,
            whispering to each other
                        when they look at us.
You can come walking toward my window after dusk
            when I can’t see past the lamplight in the glass,
when the chipped plates rattle on the counter
            and the cinders
dance on the cross-ties under the wheels of southbound freights.
Bring children if you want, and the long wounds of sisters
            branching away
                        behind you toward the sea.
Bring your mother’s tense distracted face
                        and the shoulders of plane mechanics
slumped in the Naugahyde booths of the airport diner,
            waiting for you to bring their eggs. 
I’ll bring all the bottles of gin I drank by myself
            and my cracked mouth opened partway
as I slept in the back of my blue Impala
                                                          dreaming of spiders.
I won’t forget the lines running deeply
            in the cheeks of the Polish landlady
who wouldn’t let the cops upstairs,
            the missing ring finger of the machinist from Spenard
whose money I stole after he passed out to go downtown in a cab
and look for whores,
            or the trembling lower jaw of my son, watching me
back my motorcycle from his mother’s driveway one last time,
            the ribbons and cone-shaped birthday hats
scattered on the lawn,
                                  the rain coming down like broken glass. 
We’ll go out under the stars and sit together on the ground
            and there will be enough to eat for everybody.
They can sleep on my couches and rug,
                                                         and the next day
I’ll go to work, stepping easily across the scaffolding, feeding
the cable gently into the new pipes on the roof,
                                                                  and dreaming
like St Francis of the still dark rocks
that disappear under the morning tide,
                                             only to climb back into the light,
sea-rimed, salt-blotched, their patched webs of algae
blazing with flies in the sun.

O my dark Rosaleen,     Do not sigh, do not weep! The priests are on the ocean green,     They march along the deep. There’s wine from the royal Pope,     Upon the ocean green;   And Spanish ale shall give you hope,       My Dark Rosaleen!     My own Rosaleen!  Shall glad your heart, shall give you hope, Shall give you health, and help, and hope,     My Dark Rosaleen!  Over hills, and thro’ dales,     Have I roam’d for your sake; All yesterday I sail’d with sails     On river and on lake. The Erne, at its highest flood,     I dash’d across unseen, For there was lightning in my blood,     My Dark Rosaleen!      My own Rosaleen! O, there was lightning in my blood, Red lighten’d thro’ my blood.     My Dark Rosaleen!   All day long, in unrest,     To and fro, do I move. The very soul within my breast     Is wasted for you, love! The heart in my bosom faints     To think of you, my Queen, My life of life, my saint of saints,     My Dark Rosaleen!     My own Rosaleen! To hear your sweet and sad complaints, My life, my love, my saint of saints,     My Dark Rosaleen! Woe and pain, pain and woe,     Are my lot, night and noon, To see your bright face clouded so,     Like to the mournful moon. But yet will I rear your throne     Again in golden sheen;  ‘Tis you shall reign, shall reign alone,     My Dark Rosaleen!     My own Rosaleen! ‘Tis you shall have the golden throne, ‘Tis you shall reign, and reign alone,     My Dark Rosaleen!  Over dews, over sands,     Will I fly, for your weal: Your holy delicate white hands     Shall girdle me with steel. At home, in your emerald bowers,     From morning’s dawn till e’en, You’ll pray for me, my flower of flowers,     My Dark Rosaleen!     My fond Rosaleen! You’ll think of me through daylight hours My virgin flower, my flower of flowers,     My Dark Rosaleen!  I could scale the blue air,     I could plough the high hills, Oh, I could kneel all night in prayer,     To heal your many ills! And one beamy smile from you     Would float like light between My toils and me, my own, my true,     My Dark Rosaleen!     My fond Rosaleen! Would give me life and soul anew,     My Dark Rosaleen!  O, the Erne shall run red,     With redundance of blood, The earth shall rock beneath our tread,       And flames wrap hill and wood,  And gun-peal and slogan-cry     Wake many a glen serene, Ere you shall fade, ere you shall die,     My Dark Rosaleen!     My own Rosaleen! The Judgement Hour must first be nigh, Ere you can fade, ere you can die,     My Dark Rosaleen!

PROLOGUE 
Animals tame and animals feral
prowled the Dark Ages in search of a moral:
the canine was Loyal, the lion was Virile,
rabbits were Potent and gryphons were Sterile.
Sloth, Envy, Gluttony, Pride—every peril
was fleshed into something phantasmic and rural,
while Courage, Devotion, Thrift—every bright laurel
crowned a creature in some mythological mural. 
Scientists think there is something immoral
in singular brutes having meat that is plural:
beasts are mere beasts, just as flowers are floral.
Yet between the lines there’s an implicit demurral;
the habit stays with us, albeit it’s puerile:
when Darwin saw squirrels, he saw more than Squirrel.   1. THE ANT 
The ant, Darwin reminded us,
defies all simple-mindedness:
Take nothing (says the ant) on faith,
and never trust a simple truth.
The PR men of bestiaries
eulogized for centuries
this busy little paragon,
nature’s proletarian—
but look here, Darwin said: some ants
make slaves of smaller ants, and end
exploiting in their peonages
the sweating brows of their tiny drudges. 
Thus the ant speaks out of both
sides of its mealy little mouth:
its example is extolled
to the workers of the world,
but its habits also preach
the virtues of the idle rich.   2. THE WORM 
Eyeless in Gaza, earless in Britain,
lower than a rattlesnake’s belly-button,
deaf as a judge and dumb as an audit:
nobody gave the worm much credit
till Darwin looked a little closer
at this spaghetti-torsoed loser.
Look, he said, a worm can feel
and taste and touch and learn and smell;
and ounce for ounce, they’re tough as wrestlers,
and love can turn them into hustlers,
and as to work, their labors are mythic,
small devotees of the Protestant Ethic:
they’ll go anywhere, to mountains or grassland,
south to the rain forests, north to Iceland,
fifty thousand to every acre
guzzling earth like a drunk on liquor,
churning the soil and making it fertile,
earning the thanks of every mortal:
proud Homo sapiens, with legs and arms—
his whole existence depends on worms.
So, History, no longer let
the worm’s be an ignoble lot
unwept, unhonored, and unsung.
Moral: even a worm can turn.   3. THE RABBIT 
a.   Except in distress, the rabbit is silent,
      but social as teacups: no hare is an island.
            (Moral:
            silence is golden—or anyway harmless;
            rabbits may run, but never for Congress.) 
b.   When a rabbit gets miffed, he bounds in an orbit,
      kicking and scratching like—well, like a rabbit.
            (Moral:
            to thine own self be true—or as true as you can;
            a wolf in sheep’s clothing fleeces his skin.) 
c.   He populates prairies and mountains and moors,
      but in Sweden the rabbit can’t live out of doors.
            (Moral:
      to know your own strength, take a tug at your shackles;
            to understand purity, ponder your freckles.) 
d.   Survival developed these small furry tutors;
      the morals of rabbits outnumber their litters.
            (Conclusion:
            you needn’t be brainy, benign, or bizarre
            to be thought a great prophet. Endure. Just endure.)   4. THE GOSSAMER 
Sixty miles from land the gentle trades
that silk the Yankee clippers to Cathay
sift a million gossamers, like tides
of fluff above the menace of the sea. 
These tiny spiders spin their bits of webbing
and ride the air as schooners ride the ocean;
the Beagle trapped a thousand in its rigging,
small aeronauts on some elusive mission. 
The Megatherium, done to extinction
by its own bigness, makes a counterpoint
to gossamers, who breathe us this small lesson:
for survival, it’s the little things that count.

The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!
 Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast,Warm breath, light whisper, tender semi-tone,
 Bright eyes, accomplish’d shape, and lang’rous waist!Faded the flower and all its budded charms,
 Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes,Faded the shape of beauty from my arms,
 Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise –Vanish’d unseasonably at shut of eve,
 When the dusk holiday – or holinightOf fragrant-curtain’d love begins to weave
 The woof of darkness thick, for hid delight,But, as I’ve read love’s missal through to-day,He’ll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray.

It is 12:20 in New York a Friday
three days after Bastille day, yes
it is 1959 and I go get a shoeshine
because I will get off the 4:19 in Easthampton   
at 7:15 and then go straight to dinner
and I don’t know the people who will feed me 
I walk up the muggy street beginning to sun   
and have a hamburger and a malted and buy
an ugly NEW WORLD WRITING to see what the poets   
in Ghana are doing these days
                                                        I go on to the bank
and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once heard)   
doesn’t even look up my balance for once in her life   
and in the GOLDEN GRIFFIN I get a little Verlaine   
for Patsy with drawings by Bonnard although I do   
think of Hesiod, trans. Richmond Lattimore or   
Brendan Behan’s new play or Le Balcon or Les Nègres
of Genet, but I don’t, I stick with Verlaine
after practically going to sleep with quandariness 
and for Mike I just stroll into the PARK LANE
Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega and   
then I go back where I came from to 6th Avenue   
and the tobacconist in the Ziegfeld Theatre and   
casually ask for a carton of Gauloises and a carton
of Picayunes, and a NEW YORK POST with her face on it 
and I am sweating a lot by now and thinking of
leaning on the john door in the 5 SPOT
while she whispered a song along the keyboard
to Mal Waldron and everyone and I stopped breathing

An Ode Attempted in English Sapphic



When the fierce north wind with his airy forces Rears up the Baltic to a foaming fury, And the red lightning with a storm of hail comes                                Rushing amain down,  How the poor sailors stand amazed and tremble, While the hoarse thunder, like a bloody trumpet, Roars a loud onset to the gaping waters,                                Quick to devour them!  Such shall the noise be and the wild disorder, (If things eternal may be like these earthly) Such the dire terror, when the great Archangel                                Shakes the creation,  Tears the strong pillars of the vault of heaven, Breaks up old marble, the repose of princes; See the graves open, and the bones arising,                                Flames all around ’em!  Hark, the shrill outcries of the guilty wretches! Lively bright horror and amazing anguish Stare through their eyelids, while the living worm lies                                Gnawing within them.  Thoughts like old vultures prey upon their heart-strings, And the smart twinges, when the eye beholds the Lofty Judge frowning, and a flood of vengeance                                Rolling afore him.  Hopeless immortals! how they scream and shiver, While devils push them to the pit wide-yawning Hideous and gloomy, to receive them headlong                            Down to the center.  Stop here, my fancy: (all away ye horrid Doleful ideas); come, arise to Jesus; How He sits God-like! and the saints around him                                Throned, yet adoring!  Oh may I sit there when he comes triumphant Dooming the nations! then ascend to glory While our hosannas all along the passage                                Shout the Redeemer.

Bargain tarts, raspberry, goose,
he said, don't write about that
surgery, women who have hacked off write
all parts and natures of women
who lose food in the bottom parts
of refrigerators, onions, scallions,
sour tomatoes, tiny cocktail weenies
lost in the airless dark write
When you give over your breast
to cancer, for God's sake don't
write about it. 
Write about silliness, holding hands
in sandboxes, small girls playing fudge-
and-find-me-alley-tag at dusk, Rochester,
state of pubescent, New Yorka roonie. 
...day I learned to drive aimed car
at horizon and floored it. Got there.
God in color, no cable, firsthand.
Going and coming back I thought I'd live. 
Not much for visions, still at sink soaking
pinkies in sweetalmond suds, I heard Mom.
Come on home, she said. Scared the witless bejeebies
out of me. Next day I opted for surgery.
Cut that mama off and saved my life.
Big daddy surgeon said right on the mark, sweet honey.
It was done. 
He's got a girlfriend works at his office, don't you know,
she thinks he's licorice stick swinger. I caught them
hugging in the mimeo room. Ain't nothing to it, he said,
rolling his cup of a palm over the scar. Mmmmmm-mmmmm,
this hillock is a sweet raisin, roll over baby, pour me out.
Okeydokey. 
What came next in the woods, woolly dark trees
don't give a fudge if what's hugging them hard
dents in two places. I hang on for dear life.
Filled pockets with seedpods, got bulbs
I shoehorned into clay pots for life's sake.
Nevertheless the disc shone hard, or didn't.

His head rose like a torch in a tomb.
Banquet-style, as at a second Symposium, 
The others lounged on couches or lay knocked out.
A net of shadows dangled from wire-meshed windows. 
Buffeted there, there, some swam against currents
Or were swept off into underwater canyons. 
Visitors, confusion streaming over them, speech
Foaming into eddies, words lolling like jetsam 
On the lightless bottom, listened to the news
Of minds crammed in bodies: Here, all was stoic 
Or hectic or unspeaking disconnection.
Moving shadows on the TV screen implied 
A world out there, though a world more couth,
More uncouth? in four o’clock’s slushy freezing dark: 
Plato’s cave loomed in semblance of the walls,
Only wasn’t it the cave as All, no outside 
Not inside, nothing more real to go out into?
He peered far down to where dark swam up 
From the depthless screen and hovered poised
Above dark-in-light: Sergeant Schultz kept repeating, 
“I know nothing, nothing,” his funny-Nazi German accent
As he recoils from his ever sauve tormentor, the American 
POW Colonel Hogan who threatens Schultz
With good-humored ruthlessness as bad as a mother 
In a supermarket aisle cajoling her greedy-eyed child,
“Ah ah ah—remember the Russian front!” 
—Poor Schultz’s accent making him more human in his terror,
Though only an actor acting his lines through 
The canned laughter’s bacchic furor sweeping down
The corridor to die in murmurs of slippers shushing. 
Cast yourself in it, imagine having to say those lines,
Not just now, but always, eternity a chaos 
Of laugh-track frenzy more demonic than funny,
Reruns of Hogan haunted by the actor 
Who acts Hogan’s lines, his real-life orgies
Before a secret camera ending in his Glogotha, 
His infamy to be bludgeoned and found wrapped
Naked in a shower curtain that hangs 
In the mind like the cave’s walls turning outside
Inside outside inside no end or difference inside out 
—The almost see-through membrane of a world gone flat:
He hunches forward to change the channel. 
Muttering something to Schultz’s “I know nothing, nothing,”
A grim joke maybe, “Ain’t that the truth...” though really, 
Who could know what words he was or wasn’t
Answering, who can hear above the roar of 
Earth moving under him, trying to throw him off
As he clings to the sofa hurtling through space! 
And as he clings, the screen slowly opens and fans out wide
Around the National Broadcasting Corporation peacock 
Waving its plumes, flaming blues, greens, radiant vermilions,
Brilliance of the seasons, late-morning pastels 
Easy and restful for the brain and eye,
Sempiternal hues Atlantis rose up and sank back into. 
And these feather off into grays, solid wintry
Grays that give off nothing and reflect nothing back.

What are days for?
Days are where we live.   
They come, they wake us   
Time and time over.
They are to be happy in:   
Where can we live but days? 
Ah, solving that question
Brings the priest and the doctor   
In their long coats
Running over the fields.

Swift and subtle
The flying shuttle
Crosses the web
And fills the loom,
Leaving for range
Of choice or change
No room, no room.

for Edmund White



Lunch: as we close the twentieth century,
death, like a hanger-on or a wanna-be
            sits with us at the cluttered bistro
            table, inflecting the conversation. 
Elderly friends take lovers, rent studios,
plan trips to unpronounceable provinces.
            Fifty makes the ironic wager
            that his biographer will outlive him— 
as may the erudite eighty-one-year-old
dandy with whom a squabble is simmering.
            His green-eyed architect companion
            died in the spring. He is frank about his 
grief, as he savors spiced pumpkin soup, and a
sliced rare filet. We’ll see the next decade in
            or not. This one retains its flavor.
            “Her new book ...” “... brilliant!” “She slept with ...” “Really!” 
Long arabesques of silver-tipped sentences
drift on the current of our two languages
            into the mist of late September
            midafternoon, where the dusk is curling 
Just thirty-eight: her last chemotherapy
treatment’s the same day classes begin again.
            I went through it a year before she
            started; but hers was both breasts, and lymph nodes. 
She’s always been a lax vegetarian.
Now she has cut out butter and cheese, and she
            never drank wine or beer. What else is
            there to eliminate? Tea and coffee ... ? 
(Our avocado salads are copious.)
It’s easier to talk about politics
            than to allow the terror that shares
            both of our bedrooms to find words. It made 
the introduction; it’s an acquaintance we’ve
in common. Trading medical anecdotes
            helps out when conversation lapses.
            We don’t discuss Mitterrand and cancer. 
Four months (I say) I’ll see her, see him again.
(I dream my life; I wake to contingencies.)
            Now I walk home along the river,
            into the wind, as the clouds break open.

Dead love, by treason slain, lies stark, White as a dead stark-stricken dove: None that pass by him pause to mark          Dead love.  His heart, that strained and yearned and strove As toward the sundawn strives the lark, Is cold as all the old joy thereof.  Dead men, re-arisen from dust, may hark When rings the trumpet blown above: It will not raise from out the dark          Dead love. 


^^EOP^^

The plunging limbers over the shattered track Racketed with their rusty freight, Stuck out like many crowns of thorns, And the rusty stakes like sceptres old To stay the flood of brutish men Upon our brothers dear.  The wheels lurched over sprawled dead But pained them not, though their bones crunched, Their shut mouths made no moan. They lie there huddled, friend and foeman, Man born of man, and born of woman, And shells go crying over them From night till night and now.  Earth has waited for them, All the time of their growth Fretting for their decay: Now she has them at last! In the strength of their strength Suspended—stopped and held.  What fierce imaginings their dark souls lit? Earth! have they gone into you! Somewhere they must have gone, And flung on your hard back Is their soul’s sack Emptied of God-ancestralled essences. Who hurled them out? Who hurled?  None saw their spirits’ shadow shake the grass, Or stood aside for the half used life to pass Out of those doomed nostrils and the doomed mouth, When the swift iron burning bee Drained the wild honey of their youth.  What of us who, flung on the shrieking pyre, Walk, our usual thoughts untouched, Our lucky limbs as on ichor fed, Immortal seeming ever? Perhaps when the flames beat loud on us, A fear may choke in our veins And the startled blood may stop.  The air is loud with death, The dark air spurts with fire, The explosions ceaseless are. Timelessly now, some minutes past, Those dead strode time with vigorous life, Till the shrapnel called ‘An end!’ But not to all. In bleeding pangs Some borne on stretchers dreamed of home, Dear things, war-blotted from their hearts.  Maniac Earth! howling and flying, your bowel Seared by the jagged fire, the iron love, The impetuous storm of savage love. Dark Earth! dark Heavens! swinging in chemic smoke, What dead are born when you kiss each soundless soul With lightning and thunder from your mined heart, Which man’s self dug, and his blind fingers loosed?  A man’s brains splattered on A stretcher-bearer’s face; His shook shoulders slipped their load, But when they bent to look again The drowning soul was sunk too deep For human tenderness.  They left this dead with the older dead, Stretched at the cross roads.  Burnt black by strange decay Their sinister faces lie, The lid over each eye, The grass and coloured clay More motion have than they, Joined to the great sunk silences.  Here is one not long dead; His dark hearing caught our far wheels, And the choked soul stretched weak hands To reach the living word the far wheels said, The blood-dazed intelligence beating for light, Crying through the suspense of the far torturing wheels Swift for the end to break Or the wheels to break, Cried as the tide of the world broke over his sight.  Will they come? Will they ever come? Even as the mixed hoofs of the mules, The quivering-bellied mules, And the rushing wheels all mixed With his tortured upturned sight. So we crashed round the bend, We heard his weak scream, We heard his very last sound, And our wheels grazed his dead face.

In my coat I sit
At the window sill
Wintering with snow
That did not melt
It fell long ago
At night, by stealth
I was where I am
When the snow began

Raymond Radiguet



Like seven birds sleeping on the plateau
Overlooking the shipwreck of love, mystery
Of the drunken visitors wandering off
With your wife, men who talk with a bad accent,
The condemned the abandoned, one day of silence,
Two days of silence, dreams shattered and protected,
The more the blossoms the more you suffer.

Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!       There’s none of these so lonely and poor of old,       But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold. These laid the world away; poured out the red Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be       Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,       That men call age; and those who would have been, Their sons, they gave, their immortality.  Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth,       Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain, Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,       And paid his subjects with a royal wage; And Nobleness walks in our ways again;       And we have come into our heritage.

These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,       Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth. The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs,       And sunset, and the colours of the earth. These had seen movement, and heard music; known       Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended; Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;       Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended.  There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after,       Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white       Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance, A width, a shining peace, under the night.

His clumsy body is a golden fruit
pendulous in the pear tree 
Blunt fingers among the multitudinous buds 
Adriatic blue the sky above and through
the forking twigs 
Sun ruddying tree’s trunk, his trunk
his massive head thick-nobbed with burnished curls
tight-clenched in bud 
(Painting by Generalíc. Primitive.) 
I watch him prune with silent secateurs 
Boots in the crotch of branches shift their weight
heavily as oxen in a stall 
Hear small inarticulate mews from his locked mouth
a kitten in a box 
Pear clippings fall
                            soundlessly on the ground
Spring finches sing
                            soundlessly in the leaves 
A stone. A stone in ears and on his tongue 
Through palm and fingertip he knows the tree’s
quick springtime pulse 
Smells in its sap the sweet incipient pears 
Pale sunlight’s choppy water glistens on
his mutely snipping blades 
and flags and scraps of blue
above him make regatta of the day 
But when he sees his wife’s foreshortened shape
sudden and silent in the grass below
uptilt its face to him 
then air is kisses, kisses 
stone dissolves 
his locked throat finds a little door 
and through it feathered joy
flies screaming like a jay

Dear, if you change, I’ll never choose again; Sweet, if you shrink, I’ll never think of love;Fair, if you fail, I’ll judge all beauty vain;Wise, if too weak, more wits I’ll never prove.Dear, sweet, fair, wise,-change, shrink, nor be not weak;And on my faith, my faith shall never break.
Earth with her flowers shall sooner heaven adorn;Heaven her bright stars through, earth’s dim globe shall move;Fire heat shall lose, and frosts of flame be born;Air, made to shine, as black as hell shall prove:Earth, heaven, fire, air, the world transformed shall view,Ere I prove false to faith, or strange to you.

I saw your picture
in the 79th street
station. You said
you’d be interested
in any comments I
might have on the
condition of the
station Mr. Fanelli,
there is a lot of
debris in the 79th street
station that makes it
unpleasant to wait in
for more than a few
minutes. The station
could use a paint
job and maybe
new speakers so you
could understand
the delay announcements
that are always being
broadcast. Mr.
Fanelli—there are
a lot of people sleeping
in the 79th street station
& it makes me sad
to think they have no
home to go to. Mr.
Fanelli, do you think
you could find a more
comfortable place for them
to rest? It’s pretty noisy
in the subway, especially
all those express trains
hurtling through every
few minutes, anyway when the
trains are in service.
I have to admit, Mr. Fanelli, I
think the 79th street station’s
in pretty bad shape
& sometimes at night
as I toss in my bed
I think the world’s
not doing too good
either, & I
wonder what’s going
to happen, where we’re
headed, if we’re
headed anywhere, if
we even have heads. Mr.
Fanelli, do you think if
we could just start
with the 79th street
station & do what
we could with that
then maybe we could,
you know, I guess, move
on from there? Mr.
Fanelli, when I saw your
picture & the sign
asking for suggestions
I thought, if
you really wanted to
get to the bottom
of what’s wrong then
maybe it was my job
to write to you: Maybe
you’ve never been inside
the 79th street station
because you’re so busy
managing the 72nd street
& 66th street stations,
maybe you don’t know
the problems we have
at 79th—I mean the
dirt & frequent
delays & the feeling of
total misery that
pervades the place. Mr.
Fanelli, are you reading
this far in the letter
or do you get so
many letters every day
that you don’t have
time to give each
one the close attention
it desires? Or am I
the only person who’s
taken up your invitation
to get in touch &
you just don’t have enough
experience to know how to
respond? I’m sorry
I can’t get your attention
Mr. Fanelli because I really
believe if you ask
for comments then you
ought to be willing
to act on them—even
if ought is too
big a word to throw
around at this point.
Mr. Fanelli
I hope you won’t
think I’m rude
if I ask you a
personal question. Do
you get out of the
office much?
Do you go to the movies
or do you prefer
sports—or maybe
quiet evenings at a
local restaurant? Do
you read much, Mr. Fanelli?
I don’t mean just
Gibbons and like
that, but philosophy—
have you read much
Hanna Arendt or
do you prefer
a more ideological
perspective?
I think if I understood
where you are coming from,
Mr. Fanelli, I could
write to you more cogently,
more persuasively. Mr.
Fanelli, do you get out
of the city at all—I
mean like up to Bear
Mountain or out to
Montauk? I mean do you
notice how unpleasant
the air is in the 79th
street station—that we
could use some cooling
or air-filtering system
down there? Mr.
Fanelli, do you think
it’s possible we
could get together
and talk about
these things in
person? There are
a few other points
I’d like to go over
with you if I could
get the chance. Things
I’d like to talk to
you about but that
I’d be reluctant to
put down on paper.
Mr. Fanelli, I haven’t
been feeling very good
lately and I thought
meeting with you face
to face might change
my mood, might put
me into a new frame
of mind. Maybe we
could have lunch?
Or maybe after work?
Think about it, Mr.
Fanelli.

It has been so wet stones glaze in moss;
everything blooms coldly. 
I expect you. I thought one night it was you
at the base of the drive, you at the foot of the stairs, 
you in a shiver of light, but each time
leaves in wind revealed themselves, 
the retreating shadow of a fox, daybreak.
We expect you, cat and I, bluebirds and I, the stove. 
In May we dreamed of wreaths burning on bonfires
over which young men and women leapt. 
June efforts quietly.
I’ve planted vegetables along each garden wall 
so even if spring continues to disappoint
we can say at least the lettuce loved the rain. 
I have new gloves and a new hoe.
I practice eulogies. He was a hawk

of a salamander crossing the old pony post road. 
Yours is the name the leaves chatter
at the edge of the unrabbited woods.

Death, thou wast once an uncouth hideous thing,                            Nothing but bones,       The sad effect of sadder groans: Thy mouth was open, but thou couldst not sing.  For we considered thee as at some six                            Or ten years hence,       After the loss of life and sense, Flesh being turned to dust, and bones to sticks.  We looked on this side of thee, shooting short;                          Where we did find       The shells of fledge souls left behind, Dry dust, which sheds no tears, but may extort.  But since our Savior’s death did put some blood                            Into thy face,       Thou art grown fair and full of grace, Much in request, much sought for as a good.  For we do now behold thee gay and glad,                            As at Doomsday;       When souls shall wear their new array, And all thy bones with beauty shall be clad.  Therefore we can go die as sleep, and trust                            Half that we have       Unto an honest faithful grave; Making our pillows either down, or dust.

What do I owe to you

 Who loved me not at all, I owe the little open gate  
 That led through heaven’s wall.

Our substitute is strange because
he looks a lot like Santa Claus.
In fact, the moment he walked in
we thought that he was Santa’s twin. 
We wouldn’t think it quite so weird,
if it were just his snowy beard.
But also he has big black boots
and wears these fuzzy bright red suits. 
He’s got a rather rounded gut
that’s like a bowl of you-know-what.
And when he laughs, it’s deep and low
and sounds a lot like “Ho! Ho! Ho!” 
He asks us all if we’ve been good
and sleeping when we know we should.
He talks of reindeers, sleighs, and elves
and tells us to behave ourselves. 
And when it’s time for us to go
he dashes out into the snow.
But yesterday we figured out
just what our sub is all about. 
We know just why he leaves so quick,

We had a city also. Hand in hand
Wandered happy as travellers our own land.
Murmured in turn the hearsay of each stone
Or, where a legend faltered, lived our own.
The far-seen obelisk my father set
(Pinning two roads forever where they met)
Waved us in wandering circles, turned our tread
Where once morass engulfed that passionate head. 
Cornice rose in ranges, rose so high
It saw no sky, that forum, but noon sky.
Marble shone like shallows; columns too
Streamed with cool light as rocks in breakers do. 
O marble many-colored as reach of thought,
Tones so recollected and so distraught.
Golden: like swimmers when the August shore
Brightens their folklore poses more and more.
Or grey with silver: moon’s whirling spell
Over the breathless olives we knew well;
Ivory as shoulders there that summer-dressed
Curve to come shyly naked, then find rest
(The tresses love dishevelled leaning dazed
And grateful). Or the wayward stone that blazed
As cheeks do. Or as eyes half-lowered flare.
Violet as veins are, love knows where.
Fine coral as the shy and wild tonguetip,
Undersea coral, rich as inner lip. 
There was a stone to build on!
                                              Friezes ran
In strong chorales that where they closed began;
And statues: each a wrung or ringing phrase
In the soul’s passionate cadence of her days. 
O stone so matched and massive, worked so well,
Who could believe it when the first brick fell?
Who could imagine the unlucky word
Would darken to the worldwide sigh we heard?
How our eyes wrenched together and held fast
Each face tightening to a chalky cast
(So poor a copy of one hour before).
Who could believe the gloom, the funnelled roar
Of cornice falling, forum falling, all
Falling? Or dream it fallen? Not a wall
With eaves to route the rain. The rivers swelled
Till roads groped in lakebottom. Nothing held
Clean edge or corner. Caking, the black flood
Left every luminous room tunnels of mud.
Earth shook: the columns walked, in midair clashed,
And the steep stone exploded as it crashed. 
Soon the barbarian swarmed like locusts blown
Between the flood and spasm of our stone.
Grunted to tug their huts and marble sties
Where friezes broke like foam in the blue skies.
Blue noses poked, recoiling as they found
Our young and glad-eyed statues underground;
Singing salvation, the lewd chisel pecks
At boy and girl: one mutilated sex. 
All our high moments cheapened—greed and grime
Charred them in rickety stithies to quicklime. 
Murderous world. That town that seemed a star
Rose in our soul. And there the ruins are.
We’ll not walk there again. Who’d wish to walk
Where the rats gather and grey tourists talk?
Who’d walk there even alive? Or bid his ghost
Trail phosphor on the melancholy coast?

You whom I could not save
Listen to me.   
Try to understand this simple speech as I would be ashamed of another.   
I swear, there is in me no wizardry of words.   
I speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree. 
What strengthened me, for you was lethal.   
You mixed up farewell to an epoch with the beginning of a new one,   
Inspiration of hatred with lyrical beauty;   
Blind force with accomplished shape. 
Here is a valley of shallow Polish rivers. And an immense bridge   
Going into white fog. Here is a broken city;   
And the wind throws the screams of gulls on your grave   
When I am talking with you. 
What is poetry which does not save   
Nations or people?   
A connivance with official lies,   
A song of drunkards whose throats will be cut in a moment,   
Readings for sophomore girls.
That I wanted good poetry without knowing it,   
That I discovered, late, its salutary aim,   
In this and only this I find salvation. 
They used to pour millet on graves or poppy seeds   
To feed the dead who would come disguised as birds.   
I put this book here for you, who once lived   
So that you should visit us no more.      Warsaw, 1945

I keep placing my hands over
my face, the fingertips just
resting on the place where I feel
my eyebrows and the fine end
of a bone. My eyes are covered
with the blood of my hands, my
palms hold
my jaws. I do this at dinner.
My daughter asks Are you all right?
and by a common miracle
when I smile
she knows I am. 
             2 
I ask her what she will do
after we eat. Sleep she
tells me. But I will clean
the deer skull, wash it. 
             3 
You gave me this skull in the woods
told me to bring it clean
and tell the story I had told you
before, about how the deer had
come to me, and I said I would. 
             4 
And I put this skull on an old
newspaper, pulled the lower part
of the jaws free, touched it first
carefully, as if it would fall apart
in my hands, the bone paper-
thin, and then I saw I could
scrub, so brushed the surface with
steel and my fingers and more
and more this surface became
familiar to me. 
             5 
I wanted to see the lines of it
what it would be if it had been
polished by the wind, the water,
and my hands, these agents making
the skull more itself.
Slowly I was not afraid at all
and my fingers went into the deepest
holes of this thing, not afraid
for myself or it, feeling
suddenly as if cleaning this
small fragment of earth away
from the crevices inside was
like loving. 
            6 
But it was when I touched the place
where the eyes were that I knew
this was the shell of the deer that had
lived here, this was this deer
and not this deer, her home and
now empty of her, but not
empty of her, I knew also, not
empty of her, as my hands
trembled. 
            7 
And in that instant remembered you
had been in that body of
that deer dying, what
does it feel like to be a deer
dying, the death consumes
you like birth, you are
nowhere else but in the center. 
            8 
Remembering those gentle deer
that watched me as I wept,
or the deer that leapt as if
out of my mind, when I saw
speaking there in that green place
the authority of the heart
and the deer of the woods where
my feet stood, stared at me until
I whispered to her and cried
at her presence. 
            9 
And when I cleaned the skull
I washed myself and sat
my body half out of the water
and put my hands again over
my face, my fingers edging the
bone over my eyes, and I thought
how good this feels and this
is a gesture you make. 
            10 
Tell this story of the deer’s skull
you asked quietly and so I
came in my own time to put
these words carefully here
slowly listing each motion
on this thin paper
as fragile and as tough
as knowledge. 
               1978

What is desire
But the hardwire argument given
To the mind’s unstoppable mouth. 
Inside the braincase, it’s I
Want that fills every blank. And then the hand
Reaches for the pleasure 
The plastic snake offers. Someone says, Yes,
It will all be fine in some future soon.
Definitely. I’ve conjured a body 
In the chair before me. Be yourself, I tell it.
Here memory makes you
Unchangeable: that shirt, those summer pants. 
That beautiful face.
That tragic beautiful mind.
That mind’s ravenous mouth 
That told you, This isn’t poison
At all but just what the machine needs. And then,
The mouth closes on its hunger. 
The heart stops.

Jim just loves to garden, yes he does.
He likes nothing better than to put on
his little overalls and his straw hat.
He says, "Let's go get those tools, Jim."
But then doubt begins to set in.
He says, "What is a garden, anyway?"
And thoughts about a "modernistic" garden
begin to trouble him, eat away at his resolve.
He stands in the driveway a long time.
"Horticulture is a groping in the dark
into the obscure and unfamiliar,
kneeling before a disinterested secret,
slapping it, punching it like a Chinese puzzle,
birdbrained, babbling gibberish, dig and
destroy, pull out and apply salt,
hoe and spray, before it spreads, burn roots,
where not desired, with gloved hands, poisonous,
the self-sacrifice of it, the self-love,
into the interior, thunderclap, excruciating,
through the nose, the earsplitting necrology
of it, the withering, shriveling,
the handy hose holder and Persian insect powder
and smut fungi, the enemies of the iris,
wireworms are worse than their parents,
there is no way out, flowers as big as heads,
pock-marked, disfigured, blinking insolently
at me, the me who so loves to garden
because it prevents the heaving of the ground
and the untimely death of porch furniture,
and dark, murky days in a large city
and the dream home under a permanent storm
is also a factor to keep in mind."

The sun is warm, the sky is clear,

   the fine spattering with his sleeve,

Unto the boundless Ocean of thy beauty Runs this poor river, charged with streams of zeal: Returning thee the tribute of my duty, Which here my love, my youth, my plaints reveal. Here I unclasp the book of my charged soul, Where I have cast th'accounts of all my care: Here have I summed my sighs, here I enroll How they were spent for thee; look what they are. Look on the dear expenses of my youth, And see how just I reckon with thine eyes: Examine well thy beauty with my truth, And cross my cares ere greater sum arise. Read it sweet maid, though it be done but slightly; Who can show all his love, doth love but lightly.


^^EOP^^

Go wailing verse, the infants of my love, Minerva-like, brought forth without a Mother: Present the image of the cares I prove, Witness your Father’s grief exceeds all other. Sigh out a story of her cruel deeds, With interrupted accents of despair: A monument that whosoever reads, May justly praise, and blame my loveless Fair. Say her disdain hath dried up my blood, And starved you, in succours still denying: Press to her eyes, importune me some good; Waken her sleeping pity with your crying. Knock at that hard heart, beg till you have moved her; And tell th’unkind, how dearly I have loved her.

But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again, Now whilst thy May hath filed thy lap with flowers, Now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain, Now use the summer smiles, ere winter lowers. And whilst thou spread’st unto the rising sun The fairest flower that ever saw the light, Now joy thy time before thy sweet be done, And, Delia, think thy morning must have night, And that thy brightness sets at length to west, When thou wilt close up that which now thou shew’st; And think the same becomes they fading best Which then shall most inveil and shadow most. Men do not weigh the stalk for what it was, When once they find her flower, her glory, pass.

When men shall find thy flower, thy glory pass, And thou, with careful brow sitting alone, Receivèd hast this message from thy glass, That tells thee truth, and says that all is gone, Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou madest, Though spent thy flame, in me the heat remaining, I that have loved thee thus before thou fadest, My faith shall wax, when thou art in thy waning. The world shall find this miracle in me, That fire can burn when all the matter’s spent; Then what my faith hath been thyself shall see, And that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent. Thou mayst repent that thou hast scorned my tears, When Winter snows upon thy golden hairs.


^^EOP^^

Unhappy pen and ill accepted papers, That intimate in vain my chaste desires, My chaste desires, the ever burning tapers, Enkindled by her eyes’ celestial fires. Celestial fires and unrespecting powers, That deign not view the glory of your might, In humble lines the work of careful hours, The sacrifice I offer to her sight. But since she scorns her own, this rests for me, I’ll moan my self, and hide the wrong I have: And so content me that her frowns should be To my infant style the cradle, and the grave. What though my self no honor get thereby, Each bird sings t’herself, and so will I.

So by sixteen we move in packs
learn to strut and slide
in deliberate lowdown rhythm
talk in a syn/co/pa/ted beat
because we want so bad
to be cool, never to be mistaken
for white, even when we leave
these rowdier L.A. streets—
remember how we paint our eyes
like gangsters
flash our legs in nylons
sassy black high heels
or two inch zippered boots
stack them by the door at night
next to Daddy’s muddy gardening shoes.

I am an eagle playing with the wind
I am a cluster of bright beads
I am the farthest star
I am the cold of dawn
I am the roaring of the rain
I am the glitter on the crust of the snow
I am the long track of the moon in a lake
I am a flame of four colors
I am a deer standing away in the dusk
I am a field of sumac and the pomme blanche
I am an angle of geese in the winter sky
I am the hunger of a young wolf
I am the whole dream of these things 
You see, I am alive, I am alive
I stand in good relation to the earth
I stand in good relation to the gods
I stand in good relation to all that is beautiful
I stand in good relation to the daughter of Tsen-tainte
You see, I am alive, I am alive

Everything stops.
A fat man on his way to Baltimore   
smokes for three hours in the club car.
The porter slips out and calls his wife,
he has one dime left and he’s almost   
yelling. Somewhere south of York,   
she thinks he said. The funeral   
procession leaves its lights on   
and out of this pure stubbornness   
its batteries go dead.
The bank robber leans on his horn   
in desperation while his partner   
snaps the rubber bands around   
the money. A band,
you can hear it up the river,
first like the new heart of the child on
your lap, then like an old moon   
pulsing below your nails, or something
softly moving through your arms and   
throat. Here,
press here, not just drums.
A clown is throwing caramels   
at the porch rails, balloons
are exploding or sailing up the river.   
The lucky trees, to be able   
to stand that close. If we talk   
too much, we’ll surely miss it. 
And at the still center
of summer it starts; cowboys ride out out
of another life, old cars get up
from the dead and dance
like cripples hired out for a tent meeting.   
Up and down the sidewalk, the town   
sucks in its breath like a girl
taking short gasps just above her trumpet,   
or a fire engine’s horn, heaving
like a drowned man or a heat wave slapping   
against the water tower, this afternoon   
just like a parade. The sore-footed   
ponies are loaded down with flags   
and the library float says
“Immortal Shakespeare,” says it
with carnations and the hides of roses,   
says it with a jester and a princess   
wearing wings. 
And she stutters, but no one cares   
or can hear her. Except for the man   
on the unicycle who tips his top hat   
to the crowd, who swears he will   
follow her anywhere, who follows   
the mayor and the city council, who   
follows the tap dancing class and the Future   
Farmers, the Lions Club and the Veterans   
of Foreign Wars; who clasps a carnation   
between his teeth and sways   
back and forth like
a broken clock. 
And then things begin again,
a car follows the man on the unicycle   
and suddenly it’s just another car,   
a pair of dice dangling
from the rearview mirror, a woman   
giving her breast to a child and another   
child carefully peeling a crayon, then   
slowly giving the peels to his
grandmother, who opens the big brass   
clasps of her pocketbook and lets   
the bright curls drop slowly
to the bottom
like confetti or a boy’s first
haircut. Like a first yellow leaf
that fell when we weren’t looking.
Because it’s summer. Like a smooth   
yellow pebble that is rubbing and rubbing   
in the new left boot of the drummer,   
that someone skimmed on the river   
exactly at three o’clock.
Not out of anger or of boredom
this time, but as if it could almost   
wear wings.

When my devotions could not pierce
                   Thy silent ears,Then was my heart broken, as was my verse;
     My breast was full of fears
                   And disorder.
   My bent thoughts, like a brittle bow,
                    Did fly asunder:Each took his way; some would to pleasures go,
      Some to the wars and thunder
                    Of alarms.
   “As good go anywhere,” they say,
                    “As to benumbBoth knees and heart, in crying night and day,
Come, come, my God, O come!                      But no hearing.”
   O that thou shouldst give dust a tongue
                    To cry to thee,And then not hear it crying! All day long
      My heart was in my knee,
                    But no hearing.
   Therefore my soul lay out of sight,
                    Untuned, unstrung:My feeble spirit, unable to look right,
      Like a nipped blossom, hung
                    Discontented.
   O cheer and tune my heartless breast,
                    Defer no time;That so thy favors granting my request,
      They and my mind may chime,
                    And mend my rhyme.

Deola passes her mornings sitting in a cafe,
and nobody looks at her. Everyone’s rushing to work,
under a sun still fresh with the dawn. Even Deola
isn’t looking for anyone: she smokes serenely, breathing
the morning. In years past, she slept at this hour
to recover her strength: the throw on her bed
was black with the boot-prints of soldiers and workers,
the backbreaking clients. But now, on her own,
it’s different: the work’s more refined, and it’s easier.

I 
A score of years ago I felled a hundred pines to build a house. 
Two stories, seven rooms in all.
                                              I built my love a home.
                                                                                 Our
daughter was in orbit in the womb.
                                                   Mountains spun off like the arm
of a galaxy into the emptiness our windows framed.
                                                                           "What a
view!" our friends exclaimed, and "Sunsets to die for every single night!"  
2 
Vertigo of solitude, distillate of loneliness for blood, my wife
untrue, my daughter flown, I, like a widower or worse, move
among the rooms I made.
                                     Where once I was not alone, now each
closed door is panic, and spaces grow immense with memory, like
shadows at dusk.
                         Gone that arrangement of allegiances called family
we never really know before it ends.
                                                      Like love itself, it isn't true till
then.
       I have no family now but remembrences of tiny joys, tinier
dramas we used to call our life, like pollen over everything: brightly
colored clothespins on the line, a cross-shaped coral earring whose
match is lost, books of fairy tales we read aloud at night.
                                                                                  I must be
dumb as a gunnysack of hammers.
                                                   Wind still blows through open
windows like it always used to do.
                                                 What did I love that made me
believe it would last?

He is pushing a black Ford
through an empty street -
a car like his father's
that beat the flat roads like wind
in summer and brought him here. 
He never forgave his father.
That was the year he left home.
Then there was talk of weather
and everyone was packing.
Windmills were stopped
all over Kansas. 
He is thinking of fathers,
the ways they never forgive you,
withholding love like lust.
But they quit, they stop like pumps.
There is no way to
set them working again. 
He is thinking of mothers,
how she could not know how he
half followed girls down dark streets
of his heart, how that loneliness
is passed to sons,
to the fathers of sons. 
He is pushing a black Ford.
Its problem is such a heart
you cannot give it enough care.
Like a father it will quit.
And there is no end to this.

Careful observers may foretell the hour (By sure prognostics) when to dread a shower: While rain depends, the pensive cat gives o’er Her frolics, and pursues her tail no more. Returning home at night, you’ll find the sink Strike your offended sense with double stink. If you be wise, then go not far to dine; You’ll spend in coach hire more than save in wine. A coming shower your shooting corns presage, Old achès throb, your hollow tooth will rage. Sauntering in coffeehouse is Dulman seen; He damns the climate and complains of spleen.          Meanwhile the South, rising with dabbled wings, A sable cloud athwart the welkin flings, That swilled more liquor than it could contain, And, like a drunkard, gives it up again. Brisk Susan whips her linen from the rope, While the first drizzling shower is born aslope: Such is that sprinkling which some careless quean Flirts on you from her mop, but not so clean: You fly, invoke the gods; then turning, stop To rail; she singing, still whirls on her mop. Not yet the dust had shunned the unequal strife, But, aided by the wind, fought still for life, And wafted with its foe by violent gust, ’Twas doubtful which was rain and which was dust. Ah! where must needy poet seek for aid, When dust and rain at once his coat invade? Sole coat, where dust cemented by the rain Erects the nap, and leaves a mingled stain.          Now in contiguous drops the flood comes down, Threatening with deluge this devoted town. To shops in crowds the daggled females fly, Pretend to cheapen goods, but nothing buy. The Templar spruce, while every spout’s abroach, Stays till ’tis fair, yet seems to call a coach. The tucked-up sempstress walks with hasty strides, While seams run down her oiled umbrella’s sides. Here various kinds, by various fortunes led, Commence acquaintance underneath a shed. Triumphant Tories and desponding Whigs Forget their feuds, and join to save their wigs. Boxed in a chair the beau impatient sits, While spouts run clattering o’er the roof by fits, And ever and anon with frightful din The leather sounds; he trembles from within. So when Troy chairmen bore the wooden steed, Pregnant with Greeks impatient to be freed (Those bully Greeks, who, as the moderns do, Instead of paying chairmen, run them through), Laocoön struck the outside with his spear, And each imprisoned hero quaked for fear.          Now from all parts the swelling kennels flow, And bear their trophies with them as they go: Filth of all hues and odors seem to tell What street they sailed from, by their sight and smell. They, as each torrent drives with rapid force, From Smithfield or St. Pulchre’s shape their course, And in huge confluence joined at Snow Hill ridge, Fall from the conduit prone to Holborn Bridge. Sweepings from butchers’ stalls, dung, guts, and blood, Drowned puppies, stinking sprats, all drenched in mud, Dead cats, and turnip tops, come tumbling down the flood.

Farewell (sweet Cooke-ham) where I first obtained Grace from that grace where perfect grace remained; And where the muses gave their full consent, I should have power the virtuous to content; Where princely palace willed me to indite, The sacred story of the soul’s delight. Farewell (sweet place) where virtue then did rest, And all delights did harbor in her breast; Never shall my sad eyes again behold Those pleasures which my thoughts did then unfold. Yet you (great Lady) Mistress of that place, From whose desires did spring this work of grace; Vouchsafe to think upon those pleasures past, As fleeting worldly joys that could not last, Or, as dim shadows of celestial pleasures, Which are desired above all earthly treasures. Oh how (methought) against you thither came, Each part did seem some new delight to frame! The house received all ornaments to grace it, And would endure no foulness to deface it. And walks put on their summer liveries, And all things else did hold like similes. The trees with leaves, with fruits, with flowers clad, Embraced each other, seeming to be glad, Turning themselves to beauteous Canopies, To shade the bright sun from your brighter eyes; The crystal streams with silver spangles graced, While by the glorious sun they were embraced; The little birds in chirping notes did sing, To entertain both you and that sweet spring. And Philomela with her sundry lays, Both you and that delightful place did praise. Oh how me thought each plant, each flower, each tree Set forth their beauties then to welcome thee! The very hills right humbly did descend, When you to tread on them did intend. And as you set your feet, they still did rise, Glad that they could receive so rich a prize. The gentle winds did take delight to be Among those woods that were so graced by thee, And in sad murmur uttered pleasing sound, That pleasure in that place might more abound. The swelling banks delivered all their pride When such a Phoenix once they had espied. Each arbor, bank, each seat, each stately tree, Thought themselves honored in supporting thee; The pretty birds would oft come to attend thee, Yet fly away for fear they should offend thee; The little creatures in the burrough by Would come abroad to sport them in your eye, Yet fearful of the bow in your fair hand. Would run away when you did make a stand. Now let me come unto that stately tree, Wherein such goodly prospects you did see; That oak that did in height his fellows pass, As much as lofty trees, low growing grass, Much like a comely cedar straight and tall, Whose beauteous stature far exceeded all. How often did you visit this fair tree, Which seeming joyful in receiving thee, Would like a palm tree spread his arms abroad, Desirous that you there should make abode; Whose fair green leaves much like a comely veil, Defended Phoebus when he would assail; Whose pleasing boughs did yield a cool fresh air, Joying his happiness when you were there. Where being seated, you might plainly see Hills, vales, and woods, as if on bended knee They had appeared, your honor to salute, Or to prefer some strange unlooked-for suit; All interlaced with brooks and crystal springs, A prospect fit to please the eyes of kings. And thirteen shires appeared all in your sight, Europe could not afford much more delight. What was there then but gave you all content, While you the time in meditation spent Of their Creator’s power, which there you saw, In all his creatures held a perfect law; And in their beauties did you plain descry His beauty, wisdom, grace, love, majesty. In these sweet woods how often did you walk, With Christ and his Apostles there to talk; Placing his holy Writ in some fair tree To meditate what you therein did see. With Moses you did mount his holy hill To know his pleasure, and perform his will. With lowly David you did often sing His holy hymns to Heaven’s eternal King. And in sweet music did your soul delight To sound his praises, morning, noon, and night. With blessed Joseph you did often feed Your pined brethren, when they stood in need. And that sweet Lady sprung from Clifford’s race, Of noble Bedford’s blood, fair stem of grace, To honorable Dorset now espoused, In whose fair breast true virtue then was housed, Oh what delight did my weak spirits find In those pure parts of her well framèd mind. And yet it grieves me that I cannot be Near unto her, whose virtues did agree With those fair ornaments of outward beauty, Which did enforce from all both love and duty. Unconstant Fortune, thou art most to blame, Who casts us down into so low a frame Where our great friends we cannot daily see, So great a difference is there in degree. Many are placed in those orbs of state, Partners in honor, so ordained by Fate, Nearer in show, yet farther off in love, In which, the lowest always are above. But whither am I carried in conceit, My wit too weak to conster of the great. Why not? although we are but born of earth, We may behold the heavens, despising death; And loving heaven that is so far above, May in the end vouchsafe us entire love. Therefore sweet memory do thou retain Those pleasures past, which will not turn again: Remember beauteous Dorset’s former sports, So far from being touched by ill reports, Wherein myself did always bear a part, While reverend love presented my true heart. Those recreations let me bear in mind, Which her sweet youth and noble thoughts did find, Whereof deprived, I evermore must grieve, Hating blind Fortune, careless to relieve, And you sweet Cooke-ham, whom these ladies leave, I now must tell the grief you did conceive At their departure, when they went away, How everything retained a sad dismay. Nay long before, when once an inkling came, Methought each thing did unto sorrow frame: The trees that were so glorious in our view, Forsook both flowers and fruit, when once they knew Of your depart, their very leaves did wither, Changing their colors as they grew together. But when they saw this had no power to stay you, They often wept, though, speechless, could not pray you, Letting their tears in your fair bosoms fall, As if they said, Why will ye leave us all? This being vain, they cast their leaves away Hoping that pity would have made you stay: Their frozen tops, like age’s hoary hairs, Shows their disasters, languishing in fears. A swarthy riveled rind all over spread, Their dying bodies half alive, half dead. But your occasions called you so away That nothing there had power to make you stay. Yet did I see a noble grateful mind Requiting each according to their kind, Forgetting not to turn and take your leave Of these sad creatures, powerless to receive Your favor, when with grief you did depart, Placing their former pleasures in your heart, Giving great charge to noble memory There to preserve their love continually. But specially the love of that fair tree, That first and last you did vouchsafe to see, In which it pleased you oft to take the air With noble Dorset, then a virgin fair, Where many a learned book was read and scanned, To this fair tree, taking me by the hand, You did repeat the pleasures which had passed, Seeming to grieve they could no longer last. And with a chaste, yet loving kiss took leave, Of which sweet kiss I did it soon bereave, Scorning a senseless creature should possess So rare a favor, so great happiness. No other kiss it could receive from me, For fear to give back what it took of thee, So I ungrateful creature did deceive it Of that which you in love vouchsafed to leave it. And though it oft had given me much content, Yet this great wrong I never could repent; But of the happiest made it most forlorn, To show that nothing’s free from Fortune’s scorne, While all the rest with this most beauteous tree Made their sad consort sorrow’s harmony. The flowers that on the banks and walks did grow, Crept in the ground, the grass did weep for woe. The winds and waters seemed to chide together Because you went away they knew not whither; And those sweet brooks that ran so fair and clear, With grief and trouble wrinkled did appear. Those pretty birds that wonted were to sing, Now neither sing, nor chirp, nor use their wing, But with their tender feet on some bare spray, Warble forth sorrow, and their own dismay. Fair Philomela leaves her mournful ditty, Drowned in deep sleep, yet can procure no pity. Each arbor, bank, each seat, each stately tree Looks bare and desolate now for want of thee, Turning green tresses into frosty gray, While in cold grief they wither all away. The sun grew weak, his beams no comfort gave, While all green things did make the earth their grave. Each brier, each bramble, when you went away Caught fast your clothes, thinking to make you stay; Delightful Echo wonted to reply To our last words, did now for sorrow die; The house cast off each garment that might grace it, Putting on dust and cobwebs to deface it. All desolation then there did appear, When you were going whom they held so dear. This last farewell to Cooke-ham here I give, When I am dead thy name in this may live, Wherein I have performed her noble hest  Whose virtues lodge in my unworthy breast, And ever shall, so long as life remains, Tying my life to her by those rich chains.

A face that should content me wondrous wellShould not be fair but lovely to behold,With gladsome cheer all grief for to expel;With sober looks so would I that it shouldSpeak without words such words as none can tell;Her tress also should be of crisped gold;With wit; and thus might chance I might be tied,And knit again the knot that should not slide.

As I stood upon London Bridge and viewed the mighty throng Of thousands of people in cabs and ’busses rapidly whirling along, All furiously driving to and fro, Up one street and down another as quick as they could go:  Then I was struck with the discordant sound of human voices there, Which seemed to me like wild geese cackling in the air: And the river Thames is a most beautiful sight, To see the steamers sailing upon it by day and by night.  And the Tower of London is most gloomy to behold, And the crown of England lies there, begemmed with precious stones and gold; King Henry the Sixth was murdered there by the Duke of Glo’ster, And when he killed him with his sword he called him an impostor.  St. Paul’s Cathedral is the finest building that ever I did see, There’s no building can surpass it in the city of Dundee, Because it’s magnificent to behold, With its beautiful dome and spire glottering like gold.  And as for Nelson’s Monument that stands in Trafalgar Square, It is a most stately monument I most solemnly declare, And towering defiantly very high, Which arrests strangers’ attention while passing by.  Then there’s two beautiful water-fountains spouting up very high, Where the weary traveller can drink when he feels dry; And at the foot of the monument there’s three bronze lions in grand array, Enough to make the stranger’s heart throb with dismay.  Then there’s Mr Spurgeon, a great preacher, which no one dare gainsay, I went to hear him preach on the Sabbath-day, And he made my heart feel light and gay, When I heard him preach and pray.  And the Tabernacle was crowded from ceiling to floor, And many were standing outside the door; He is an eloquent preacher I honestly declare, And I was struck with admiration as on him I did stare.  Then there’s Petticoat Lane I venture to say, It’s a wonderful place on the Sabbath-day; There wearing-apparel can be bought to suit the young or old, For the ready cash, silver, coppers, or gold.  Oh! mighty city of London! you are wonderful to see, And thy beauties no doubt fill the tourist’s heart with glee; But during my short stay, and while wandering there, Mr Spurgeon was the only man I heard speaking proper English I do declare.

How easily our lives could have been easier if our
fathers hadn't done in whoever stood in their way.
Did progress demand they set factories belching smoke
like volcanoes? You're right to be dumbfounded as to why 
you're forced to spend your time making up for
your ancestors' mistakes, waste this beautiful day
restoring ruined shrines and temples
so that the gods might not abandon Rome for good. 
There could be a turn about: after they were rid of
the Etruscans, a few farsighted countrymen
had the savvy to steal their fine
sarcophagi designs, along with the booty. 
Decadence is your legacy. I hold out hope
for satires, epigrams, and odes, but heaping on
the gore is not an answer, and our plays are weak
echoes of the Greeks. 
If you want to have some say in the way things are,
put yourself in the hands of a higher order.
Have faith in faith. Bow down to the gods
who oversee and underwrite and sponsor. 
There's nothing empirical left to this empire now.
What would have been routine raids on small fry
republics—from Vietnam to the Isle of Man—
are beaten back, and the opposition, 
in ecstatic mockery, turn our spoils
to souvenir necklaces and key chains.
The ancient city, riven by civil strife,
escaped destruction by fanatic Bosnia and Iraq 
with their demonic submarines, bombers,
and other dangerous toys, by a hairsbreadth.
Self-absorbed, promiscuous,
we've brought these evils on ourselves 
like people who, anticipating the worst
from a routine physical, forswear
doctors until their symptoms call for
drastic measures; as only after 
the condom-clogged, gaseous,
syringe-rich, toxic river
overflows and floods the litter-free,
segregated streets of the capital 
will the Rivers Network organize
a mass cleanup on Earth Day.
The young, lured always by the glitter of cities,
find nothing cooler than the hotter— 
than-ever-before dance-crazes flown in
from the clubs of Rio, Barcelona, or Berlin.
How was a girl to know that marriage sucks
the sap out of sex? And why not make it 
with the guests, especially if it's just the boost
his mercurial career needs to rocket off...
How are they to know the sexual spectacles
began on their own ravaged ground? 
And these out-of-towners are so endlessly grateful
for a dose of decadence because they
"sure don't get pussy like this in Topeka."
(The New Age victor is the one who gets 
the onlooker to come without anything
physical happening between them.)
"How does he think I know how to get the dry-
cleaning-mogul's cock to stiffen, as if a good 
dis weren't hard to find, like 'you use your tongue
like you're trying to remove a spot.'"
Her husband, in his white tux, appeared
nonchalant, but a second glance revealed 
a man slaphappy and dazed from one
too many Zombies; either way,
when the Titania II pulls into port
she'll allow whoever has the best 
offer, captain or mutineer, Delano or
Benito Cereno, to take her on the dance floor.
Dalliance supplies what she needs for her shopping sprees
which "this guy whose wedding ring I like never 
take off can't get through his head are
necessary. He's so dense, like I show up
in this designer dress on my 'allowance.'
Men have no idea what it costs a girl to be 
truly glamorous in times like these—
and when they land the commission
remain clueless as to why they
were chosen and not the other guy 
with the goody-two-shoes type wife."
It's shattering to consider that these nerds,
for whom watching's the real
turn on, sprang from fierce, sturdy stock 
who in their youth conquered conquerors,
brought down swaggering, gallant
Hannibal, Pyrrhus, and Antiochus,
dyeing the sea red with Punic blood. 
But the early Romans, the soldier-farmers,
knew better than to double think what had to be done,
and dug with the tools of the long-gone Sabines,
and never neglected to cut the logs to honor 
mom's firm yet anxious request for firewood as
shadows shifted on a far rise, night
fell, and man and oxen were the same
in their deep desire to lie down. 
Who is immune from ruin by time?
Each generation wearier than the one before;
these days no one deigns to have children
until they are "professionally secure." 
And the media waits long and long to warn
the idealists born during the baby-boom
that the future is also being sabotaged:
undone by sluggish sperm; hardened wombs. 
                                                       (after Horace, Odes, Book III, 6)

Under the fire escape, crouched, one knee in cinders,   
I pulled the ball-peen hammer from my belt,   
cracked a square of window pane,
the gummed latch, and swung the window,
crawled through that stone hole into the boiler room   
of Canton Elementary School, once Canton High,   
where my father served three extra years   
as star halfback and sprinter.
Behind a flashlight’s
cane of light, I climbed a staircase almost a ladder
and found a door. On the second nudge of my shoulder,
it broke into a hallway dark as history,
at whose end lay the classroom I had studied   
over and over in the deep obsession of memory. 
I swept that room with my light—an empty blackboard,
a metal table, a half-globe lying on the floor   
like a punctured basketball—then followed   
that beam across the rows of desks,
the various catalogs of lovers, the lists
of all those who would and would not do what,   
until it stopped on the corner desk of the back row,   
and I saw again, after many years the name
of my father, my name, carved deep into the oak top. 
To gauge the depth I ran my finger across that scar,   
and wondered at the dreams he must have lived   
as his eyes ran back and forth
from the cinder yard below the window
to the empty practice field
to the blade of his pocket knife etching carefully   
the long, angular lines of his name,
the dreams he must have laid out one behind another   
like yard lines, in the dull, pre-practice afternoons   
of geography and civics, before he ever dreamed
of Savo Sound or Guadalcanal.
                                             In honor of dreams
I sank to my knees on the smooth, oiled floor,   
and stood my flashlight on its end.
Half the yellow circle lit the underedge of the desk,   
the other threw a half-moon on the ceiling,   
and in that split light I tapped the hammer
easy up the overhang of the desk top. Nothing gave   
but the walls’ sharp echo, so I swung again,   
and again harder, and harder still in half anger   
rising to anger at the stubborn joint, losing all fear   
of my first crime against the city, the county,   
the state, whatever government claimed dominion,   
until I had hammered up in the ringing dark   
a salvo of crossfire, and on a frantic recoil glanced   
the flashlight, the classroom spinning black   
as a coma.
               I’ve often pictured the face of the teacher   
whose student first pointed to that topless desk,   
the shock of a slow hand rising from the back row,   
their eyes meeting over the question of absence.
I’ve wondered too if some low authority of the system   
discovered that shattered window,
and finding no typewriters, no business machines,   
no audiovisual gear missing, failed to account for it,   
so let it pass as minor vandalism.
                                                               I’ve heard nothing.
And rarely do I fret when I see that oak scar leaning   
against my basement wall, though I wonder what it means   
to own my father’s name.

I: THE MOTOR: 1905 
From hedgerows where aromas fain would be
    New volleyed odours execrably arise;
    The flocks, with hell-smoke in their patient eyes,
Into the ditch from bawling ruin flee:
Spindrift of one abominated sea
    Along all roads in wrecking fury flies
    Till on young strangled leaf, on bloom that dies,
In this far plot it writes a rune for me. 
Vast intimate tyranny! Nature dispossessed
    Helplessly hates thee, whose symbolic flare
Lights up (with what reiterance unblest!)
    Entrails of horror in a world thought fair.
False God of pastime thou, vampire of rest,
    Augur of what pollution, what despair?

The chicken I bought last night,
Frozen,
Returned to life,
Laid the biggest egg in the world,
And was awarded the Nobel Prize. 
The phenomenal egg
Was passed from hand to hand,
In a few weeks had gone all round the earth,
And round the sun
In 365 days. 
The hen received who knows how much hard currency,
Assessed in buckets of grain
Which she couldn’t manage to eat 
Because she was invited everywhere,
Gave lectures, granted interviews,
Was photographed. 
Very often reporters insisted
That I too should pose
Beside her.
And so, having served art
Throughout my life,
All of a sudden I’ve attained to fame
As a poultry breeder.

Newspaper says the boy killed by someone,   
don’t say who. I know the mother, waking,   
gets up as usual, washes her face
in cold water, and starts the coffee pot. 
She stands by the window up there on floor   
sixteen wondering why the street’s so calm   
with no cars going or coming, and then
she looks at the wall clock and sees the time. 
Now she’s too awake to go back to bed,   
she’s too awake not to remember him,
her one son, or to forget exactly
how long yesterday was, each moment dragged 
into the next by the force of her will   
until she thought this simply cannot be.   
She sits at the scarred, white kitchen table,   
the two black windows staring back at her, 
wondering how she’ll go back to work today.   
The windows don’t see anything: they’re black,   
eyeless, they give back only what’s given;   
sometimes, like now, even less than what’s given, 
yet she stares into their two black faces   
moving her head from side to side, like this,   
just like I’m doing now. Try it awhile,   
go ahead, it’s not going to kill you. 
Now say something, it doesn’t matter what   
you say because all the words are useless:   
“I’m sorry for your loss.” “This too will pass.”
“He was who he was.” She won’t hear you out 
because she can only hear the torn words   
she uses to pray to die. This afternoon   
you and I will see her just before four   
alight nimbly from the bus, her lunch box 
of one sandwich, a thermos of coffee,
a navel orange secured under her arm,
and we’ll look away. Under your breath make   
her one promise and keep it forever: 
in the little store-front church down the block,   
the one with the front windows newspapered,   
you won’t come on Saturday or Sunday   
to kneel down and pray for life eternal.

Kingston, Jamaica



Lamps have begun to light as evening,   
alluvial, fills every crevice in the courtyard,    
fills Devon House, alone with its marble columns,
its verandas and esplanades empty, 
the plantation gone, and the fields,   
the courtyard a tourist attraction now:    
glass ashtrays etched with boys
too large to be clambering coconut trees, 
statuettes of women too smooth to be burdened   
with baskets of fruit on their heads, stoneware 
with doctor birds captured in the shallowest bas-relief,
key rings carved in the rough shape of the island; 
and now even the hummingbirds are spoken of as jewels
where once everyone drowned in leaf-filtered sunlight.

Ar. Now you have been taught words and I am free,
      My pine struck open, your thick tongue untied,
      And bells call out the music of the sea. 
      From this advantage I can clearly see
      You will abuse me in your grovelling pride
      Now you have been taught words: and I am free 
      To pinch and bully you eternally,
      Swish round the island while the mermaids hide
      And bells call out the music of the sea. 
      I watched you closely from within my tree:
      Explicit fish, implicit homicide,
      Now you have been taught words, and I am free 
      To hear, who has the real victory?
      For you may drown as I draw in the tide
      And bells call out the music of the sea. 
      You lust for Her and bare your teeth at me.
      Your roarings only mock the ache inside
      Now you have been taught words. And I am free
      While bells call out the music of the sea.  Cal. Have you no feelings that you cannot tame?  Ar. My target’s everything, and in my aim,
         Achievement, while another,
            Lesser lusts may drive:
         Legs hate their lazy brother
            Who saps your precious Five
            To keep alive.  Cal. Have you no visions that you cannot name?  Ar. A picture should extend beyond its frame,
         There being no limitation
            To bright reality:
         For all their declaration
            And complexity,
            Words cannot see.  Cal. Are not the object and the word the same?  Ar. Words are but counters in a childish game;
         Each move you make is token
            Only of the rules:
         Any rule may be broken
            By the boy from a clever school
            Or a bored fool.  Cal. How is it, then, that words can hurt and maim?  Ar. If words do that, you are already lame,
         Bowed down by words like firewood,
            Clenched with words like ice:
         Language is for the coward
            Who thinks a rule is nice
            At any price.  Cal. O then unteach me language, let the cool
       Sea sidle up and draw me to its deep
       Silence. Teach me how to break the rule.  Ar. Once in the game you cannot make that leap.
      The sea will cast you up again if you
      Pretend to break the rule you really keep.  Cal. But tell me, then, if what you say is true,
       What was your knowledge when you could not move?
       What instinct told what function what to do?  Ar. Words would not help the channelled sea to prove
      It was not ocean-free, nor pine no fuel:
      I just existed, wordless, in my groove. 
               Nor do I use words now, though you
               In innocence may think I do:
               We’ve left the island and engage
               In conversation on a page
               Sand-white and, like it, bounded by
               A vast of dull eternity.
               And I (since I can understand)
               Am master of this paper land.
               Think I am quick? I am so too,
               But when I’m bored with biffing you,
               Eve’s monkey, still that is not all,
               Nor Milan’s ghost, his beck and call
               To all the fancies that I can.
               You are too human, Caliban.
               You lunge and ape the human dance.
               Music and love are sustenance
               Withheld from you like tinkling charms
               Beyond your crying outstretched arms.
               You think I did not want my tree?
               Or tire of showing off? Being ‘free’
               All of the time is like your choice
               Of endless fireworks of the voice:
               You splutter, gasp and madly shout,
               But dampness seeps up: you go out,
               The silly words trail off your tongue.
               So wings get tired, flapping among
               The fussy spirits of the air.
               You curse. I sulk. Always He’s there.
               The bullet’s speed is not a feat.
               Of time, but photograph of wheat,
               A summer fly caught in a flash
               Of speckled stillness. Hear a splash?
               You think a glacier does not move?
               Brilliance of struggling wings can prove
               Treacle of amber, and a spark
               The universe, my world my bark
               I long for, longing for the dark.  Cal. A language learnt but nothing understood:
       Now you at large, and all I owned before
       Lost like my name within the magic wood. 
       No word for saying ‘no’ to fetching wood.
       The marvellous Glove splits on the hairy claw:
       A language learnt but nothing understood. 
       At first I framed what syllables I could:
       She laughed at me and left me on the shore,
       Lost, like my name within the magic wood. 
       Think of my rage then, Ariel, as I stood,
       (A picture in my head I could not draw,
       A language learnt but nothing understood), 
       Weeping into the sea, hoping She would
       Turn back to lead me through that little door,
       Lost like my name within the magic wood. 
       Our Master calls: I think it is not good
       To be unhappy with your freedom or
       My language (learnt, but nothing understood),
       Lost like my name within the magic wood.

Courage, my Soul, now learn to wield The weight of thine immortal shield. Close on thy head thy helmet bright. Balance thy sword against the fight. See where an army, strong as fair, With silken banners spreads the air. Now, if thou be’st that thing divine, In this day’s combat let it shine: And show that Nature wants an art To conquer one resolvèd heart.  PLEASURE Welcome the creation’s guest, Lord of earth, and heaven’s heir. Lay aside that warlike crest, And of Nature’s banquet share: Where the souls of fruits and flowers Stand prepared to heighten yours.  SOUL I sup above, and cannot stay To bait so long upon the way.  PLEASURE On these downy pillows lie, Whose soft plumes will thither fly: On these roses strewed so plain Lest one leaf thy side should strain.  SOUL My gentler rest is on a thought, Conscious of doing what I ought.  PLEASURE If thou be’st with perfumes pleased, Such as oft the gods appeased, Thou in fragrant clouds shalt show Like another god below.  SOUL A soul that knows not to presume Is heaven’s and its own perfume.  PLEASURE Everything does seem to vie Which should first attract thine eye: But since none deserves that grace, In this crystal view thy face.  SOUL When the Creator’s skill is prized, The rest is all but earth disguised.  PLEASURE Hark how music then prepares For thy stay these charming airs; Which the posting winds recall, And suspend the river’s fall.  SOUL Had I but any time to lose, On this I would it all dispose. Cease, tempter. None can chain a mind Whom this sweet chordage cannot bind.  CHORUS Earth cannot show so brave a sight As when a single soul does fence The batteries of alluring sense, And heaven views it with delight.    Then persevere: for still new charges sound:    And if thou overcom’st, thou shalt be crowned.  PLEASURE All this fair, and soft, and sweet,    Which scatteringly doth shine, Shall within one beauty meet,    And she be only thine.  SOUL If things of sight such heavens be, What heavens are those we cannot see?  PLEASURE Wheresoe’er thy foot shall go    The minted gold shall lie, Till thou purchase all below,    And want new worlds to buy.  SOUL Were’t not a price, who’d value gold? And that’s worth naught that can be sold.  PLEASURE Wilt thou all the glory have    That war or peace commend? Half the world shall be thy slave    The other half thy friend.  SOUL What friends, if to my self untrue! What slaves, unless I captive you!  PLEASURE Thou shalt know each hidden cause;    And see the future time: Try what depth the centre draws;    And then to heaven climb.  SOUL None thither mounts by the degree Of knowledge, but humility.  CHORUS Triumph, triumph, victorious Soul; The world has not one pleasure more: The rest does lie beyond the Pole, And is thine everlasting store.

DORINDA When death shall part us from these kids, And shut up our divided lids, Tell me, Thyrsis, prithee do, Whither thou and I must go.  THYRSIS To the Elysium.  DORINDA                         Oh, where is’t?  THYRSIS A chaste soul can never miss’t.  DORINDA I know no way but to our home, Is our cell Elysium?  THYRSIS Turn thine eye to yonder sky, There the milky way doth lie; ’Tis a sure but rugged way, That leads to everlasting day.  DORINDA There birds may nest, but how can I That have no wings and cannot fly?  THYRSIS Do not sigh, fair nymph, for fire Hath no wings yet doth aspire Till it hit against the Pole: Heaven’s the centre of the soul.  DORINDA But in Elysium how do they Pass eternity away?  THYRSIS Oh, there’s neither hope nor fear, There’s no wolf, no fox, no bear. No need of dog to fetch our stray, Our Lightfoot we may give away; No oat-pipe’s needful; there thy ears May sleep with music of the spheres.  DORINDA Oh sweet! Oh sweet! How I my future state By silent thinking antedate: I prithee let us spend our time to come In talking of Elysium.  THYRSIS Then I’ll go on. There sheep are full Of sweetest grass and softest wool; There birds sing consorts, garlands grow, Cool winds do whisper, springs do flow. There always is a rising sun, And day is ever but begun. Shepherds there bear equal sway, And every nymph’s a Queen of May.  DORINDA Ah me, ah me!   THYRSIS                         Dorinda, why dost cry?  DORINDA I’m sick, I’m sick, and fain would die. Convince me now that this is true By bidding with me all adieu.  THYRSIS I cannot live without thee, I, I’ll for thee, much more with thee, die.  CHORUS Then let us give Corillo charge o’ the sheep, And thou and I’ll pick poppies, and them steep In wine, and drink on’t even till we weep, So shall we smoothly pass away in sleep.

A man who’s trying to be a good man
but isn’t, because he can’t not take
whatever’s said to him as judgement.
It causes him, as he puts it, to react.
His face and neck redden and bloat,
a thick blue vein bulges up his forehead
and bisects his bald pate, scaring his children
but provoking hilarity at work
where one guy likes to get his goat
by pasting pro-choice bumper stickers
on his computer screen while he’s in the john,
then gathers a group into the next cubicle
to watch when he comes back.
He has talked to his minister and to his wife
about learning how not to react,
to make a joke, and he has tried to make jokes,
but his voice gets tense, they come out flat,
so even his joke becomes a joke at his expense,
another thing to laugh at him about.
He has thought to turn to them and ask, Why don’t you like me? What have I done to you? 
But he has been told already all his life:
self-righteous goody two-shoes, a stick up your ass.
They are right. He has never never never gotten along.
He says nothing this time, just peels off the bumper sticker,
crumples it gently, places it gently
by his mousepad to dispose of later properly,
comparing his suffering to Christ’s in Gethsemane
spat upon and mocked (his minister’s advice),
and tries a smile that twists into a grimace,
which starts the hot blood rising into his face.
This is what they came for, to see Dickhead,
the bulging vein, the skull stoplight red,
and indeed it is remarkable how gorged it gets
as if his torso had become a helium pump,
so, except for him whose eyes are shut tight,
they burst into laughter together exactly at the moment
cruelty turns into astonishment.

And in that city the houses of the dead
are left empty, if the dead are famous enough;
by day the living pay to see if dust is all
      that befalls the lives they left behind. 
      Coating even the glassed-in waistcoat in time,
coloring the air of the room stripped bare,
down four stories of twisted stair it falls,
      down on the dictionary no longer there. 
      Empty your pockets,
empty your hearts, that empty upper room exhorts.
Forget the scrap of paper with the missing word
      for what’s missing— 
      go home to your rented room.
Go on. Six cramped quills, one elbow chair, missing a leg,
held up all those years by Johnson’s willing it to hold
      his bulk—now even the “soul hath elbowroom” 
      in that room where scribes scribbled out that quote.
In that city the dead never want to get up,
just as in life. What can we offer them?
      Just this dust to cover them deeper, 
      kin to the soot that shadowed their days.
Kiss from a wife who no longer wanted to be touched—
love, he held, regarded with passionate affection,
      like one sex to the other, first; or, second, 
      made do with the affection of a friend; or
managed merely parental tenderness, third; or, fourth,
no more than pleasure with, delighting in; or, fifth,
      no less than the reverent unwillingness to offend. 
      O had a long sound, as in alone. Her opium.
On clean-shirt day he would pay a visit to his wife. Pack meant large bundle of any thing—“on your head
      a pack of sorrows.” 
      Quiet. The square just off Fleet Street
so quiet Carlyle got lost on his way there.
Remember the garret floorboards’ complaint, the muffled
      ruffling of pigeons just overhead? 
      Such silence we fell into
stair by stair, the house to ourselves.
Tired of London, he claimed, and one was
      tired of life. Were we just tired? 
      Under the low ceiling as below deck,
up where no angle was true, we sank in deeper silence,
valedictory, the way it took us in.
      Volumes of ancient air closed around us, blank, 
      weighted by the latest dust.
What had we come to the house of the dead to see? Something
exotic? The zebra presented to the queen in 1726? Something
      exactly as it might have been? Did you 
      yawn first, back among the living?
You pulled me from traffic rushing downstream instead of up,
that Zambezi best forded from stripe to painted stripe,
      a “zebra crossing.” I’d looked the wrong way.

Didn’t Sappho say her guts clutched up like this?
Before a face suddenly numinous,
her eyes watered, knees melted. Did she lactate   
again, milk brought down by a girl’s kiss?   
It’s documented torrents are unloosed
by such events as recently produced
not the wish, but the need, to consume, in us,   
one pint of Maalox, one of Kaopectate.
My eyes and groin are permanently swollen,   
I’m alternatingly brilliant and witless
—and sleepless: bed is just a swamp to roll in.   
Although I’d cream my jeans touching your breast,   
sweetheart, it isn’t lust; it’s all the rest
of what I want with you that scares me shitless.

I suppose so.
I was living in an attic in Philadelphia
It became very hot in the summer and so I stayed in the
bars. I didn’t have any money and so with what was almost left
I put a small ad in the paper and said I was a writer
looking for work . . .
which was a god damned lie; I was a writer
looking for a little time and a little food and some
attic rent.
a couple days later when I finally came home
from somewhere
the landlady said, there was somebody looking for
you. and I said,
there must be some mistake. she said,
no, it was a writer and he said he wanted you to help him write
a history book.
oh, fine, I said, and I knew with that I had another week’s
rent—I mean, on the cuff—
so I sat around drinking wine on credit and watching the hot pigeons
suffer and fuck on my hot roof.
I turned the radio on real loud
drank the wine and wondered how I could make a history book
interesting but true.
but the bastard never came back,
and I had to finally sign on with a railroad track gang
going West
and they gave us cans of food but no
openers
and we broke the cans against the seats and sides of
railroad cars a hundred years old with dust
the food wasn’t cooked and the water tasted like
candlewick
and I leaped off into a clump of brush somewhere in
Texas
all green with nice-looking houses in the
distance
I found a park
slept all night
and then they found me and put me in a cell
and they asked me about murders and
robberies.
they wanted to get a lot of stuff off the books
to prove their efficiency
but I wasn’t that tired
and they drove me to the next big town
fifty-seven miles away
the big one kicked me in the ass
and they drove off.
but I lucked it:
two weeks later I was sitting in the office of the city hall
half-asleep in the sun like the big fly on my elbow
and now and then she took me down to a meeting of the council
and I listened very gravely as if I knew what was happening
as if I knew how the funds of a halfass town were being
dismantled.
later I went to bed and woke up with teethmarks all over
me, and I said, Christ, watch it, baby! you might give me
cancer! and I’m rewriting the history of the Crimean War!
and they all came to her house—
all the cowboys, all the cowboys:
fat, dull and covered with dust.
and we all shook hands.
I had on a pair of old bluejeans, and they said
oh, you’re a writer, eh?
and I said: well, some think so.
and some still think so . . .
others, of course, haven’t quite wised up yet.
two weeks later they
ran me out
of town.

There was the method of kneeling,
a fine method, if you lived in a country
where stones were smooth.
The women dreamed wistfully of bleached courtyards,   
hidden corners where knee fit rock.
Their prayers were weathered rib bones,
small calcium words uttered in sequence,
as if this shedding of syllables could somehow   
fuse them to the sky. 
There were the men who had been shepherds so long   
they walked like sheep.
Under the olive trees, they raised their arms—
Hear us! We have pain on earth!
We have so much pain there is no place to store it!
But the olives bobbed peacefully
in fragrant buckets of vinegar and thyme.
At night the men ate heartily, flat bread and white cheese,   
and were happy in spite of the pain,   
because there was also happiness. 
Some prized the pilgrimage,
wrapping themselves in new white linen   
to ride buses across miles of vacant sand.   
When they arrived at Mecca   
they would circle the holy places,   
on foot, many times,
they would bend to kiss the earth
and return, their lean faces housing mystery. 
While for certain cousins and grandmothers
the pilgrimage occurred daily,   
lugging water from the spring
or balancing the baskets of grapes.
These were the ones present at births,
humming quietly to perspiring mothers.
The ones stitching intricate needlework into children’s dresses,   
forgetting how easily children soil clothes. 
There were those who didn’t care about praying.
The young ones. The ones who had been to America.   
They told the old ones, you are wasting your time.
      Time?—The old ones prayed for the young ones.   
They prayed for Allah to mend their brains,
for the twig, the round moon,
to speak suddenly in a commanding tone. 
And occasionally there would be one
who did none of this,
the old man Fowzi, for example, Fowzi the fool,   
who beat everyone at dominoes,
insisted he spoke with God as he spoke with goats,   
and was famous for his laugh.

                    A woman was fighting a tree. The tree had come to rage at the woman’s attack, breaking free from its earth it waddled at her with its great root feet.
         Goddamn these sentiencies, roared the tree with birds shrieking in its branches.
         Look out, you’ll fall on me, you bastard, screamed the woman as she hit at the tree.
         The tree whisked and whisked with its leafy branches.
         The woman kicked and bit screaming, kill me kill me or I’ll kill you!

         Her husband seeing the commotion came running crying, what tree has lost patience?
         The ax the ax, damnfool, the ax, she screamed.
         Oh no, roared the tree dragging its long roots rhythmically limping like a sea lion towards her husband.
         But oughtn’t we to talk about this? cried her husband.
         But oughtn’t we to talk about this, mimicked his wife.
         But what is this all about? he cried.
         When you see me killing something you should reason that it will want to kill me back, she screamed.

         But before her husband could decide what next action to perform the tree had killed both the wife and her husband.
         Before the woman died she screamed, now do you see?
         He said, what...? And then he died.

Crouched before dismantled guns,
we found war souvenirs
our uncle padlocked in the attic,
a brittle latch easily pried off. 
Stiff uniforms on top, snapshots
of soldiers young as our cousins,
a velvet box of medals
as if he fought all battles 
in World War II. Bayonets, machetes,
a folded flag, two hand grenades
with missing pins. We picked up teeth
like pennies, loose, as if tossed in, 
a piece of something dark and waxy
like a fig, curved like a question mark,
a human ear. We touched dried pieces
of cloth stuck to curved bones 
and held them to the light,
turning them over and over, wondering
how did uncles learn to kill,
what would happen when we grew up.

Whatever we do, whether we light
strangers’ cigarettes—it may turn out
to be a detective wanting to know who is free   
with a light on a lonely street nights—
or whether we turn away and get a knife
planted between our shoulders for our discourtesy;   
whatever we do—whether we marry for love   
and wake up to find love is a task,
or whether for convenience to find love   
must be won over, or we are desperate—
whatever we do; save by dying,
and there too we are caught,
by being planted too close to our parents.

Why were you born when the snow was falling?You should have come to the cuckoo’s calling,Or when grapes are green in the cluster,Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster
 For their far off flying
 From summer dying.
Why did you die when the lambs were cropping?You should have died at the apples’ dropping,When the grasshopper comes to trouble,And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,
 And all winds go sighing
 For sweet things dying.

Gold shed upon suckling gold,
The time of the bole blackens,
Of the dark mounted through dapple,
While in the sealed apple
The seed cradled toward cold.
A gold on gold spent,
Put by from an elm in its years
Now its gilded of days,
Over turf’s dishevelment;
Where all which is green sickens,
All the fresh shall be sere.
All which is green sickens,
And it is but for a time
Those embered veinings blaze
A year’s delirium;
Or neared of other space,
Unportioned azure shall close
One of more, and which is,
One which goes.
Let the little pupils that will,
Of vision, gaze for salt
To whet their gazing, wit
In one weather is high
From burrow and lair, by
Nether providences’ default
An all’s accrued.
And apposite, beyond
Such primer beholdings, has
Its long accounting known 
The beetle’s morsel thus
Was rich, and the slug’s bed on
The oak’s generations, deep
Over the lark’s bones.
In slough of Edens fast
Wit in one weather shall stand,
While millennia nibble at
The sensual apple
Toppled it net,
Plenty in the palm of the hand,
And the fallen not fallen, not lost
From out its certitude—
For our unbeggaring
Has been gross. Few and late
To cherish an immoderate
Wish, hope’s calculus,
Love’s hope; few to miss,
From natural tally thrust,
In the lime-girdled space
Of choice, where alone
Man can abandon what
Is only his own;
And in cold and tarrying
Their rearisers sleep: 
While to the granite cheek
Light’s purples bring
Infinite their ministering,
And past our finial
And ragged crests, to keep
Time’s ambient stood,
Propose horizons from
Their shadowy quarries; while,
In an unwandered wood,
Or under the indifferent foot,
Is let fall, let fall a fruit,
Through eternal leisures down,
For but time’s unravelling.

As some brave admiral, in former war    Deprived of force, but pressed with courage still, Two rival fleets appearing from afar,    Crawls to the top of an adjacent hill;  From whence, with thoughts full of concern, he views    The wise and daring conduct of the fight, Whilst each bold action to his mind renews    His present glory and his past delight;  From his fierce eyes flashes of fire he throws,    As from black clouds when lightning breaks away; Transported, thinks himself amidst the foes,    And absent, yet enjoys the bloody day;  So, when my days of impotence approach,    And I’m by pox and wine’s unlucky chance Forced from the pleasing billows of debauch    On the dull shore of lazy temperance,  My pains at least some respite shall afford    While I behold the battles you maintain When fleets of glasses sail about the board,    From whose broadsides volleys of wit shall rain.  Nor let the sight of honorable scars,    Which my too forward valor did procure, Frighten new-listed soldiers from the wars:    Past joys have more than paid what I endure.  Should any youth (worth being drunk) prove nice,    And from his fair inviter meanly shrink, ’Twill please the ghost of my departed vice    If, at my counsel, he repent and drink.  Or should some cold-complexioned sot forbid,    With his dull morals, our bold night-alarms, I’ll fire his blood by telling what I did    When I was strong and able to bear arms.  I’ll tell of whores attacked, their lords at home;    Bawds’ quarters beaten up, and fortress won; Windows demolished, watches overcome;    And handsome ills by my contrivance done.  Nor shall our love-fits, Chloris, be forgot,    When each the well-looked linkboy strove t’ enjoy, And the best kiss was the deciding lot    Whether the boy fucked you, or I the boy.  With tales like these I will such thoughts inspire    As to important mischief shall incline: I’ll make him long some ancient church to fire,    And fear no lewdness he’s called to by wine.  Thus, statesmanlike, I’ll saucily impose,    And safe from action, valiantly advise; Sheltered in impotence, urge you to blows,    And being good for nothing else, be wise.

A faint smell of urine
embroidering that bouquet of mold the big cushions   
give off days the fog won’t lift, 
and a shelf of bone
growing out over the eyelids like evening’s shadow   
across a field of corn— 
The whole parade
leaking out from your shoulders, bequeathing   
to the groin a pang of distance; 
then that metallic taste in the mouth   
and a voice you had let yourself believe   
was dead 
close now by your ear, intimate and sweet:

Throw away thy rod, Throw away thy wrath:                   O my God, Take the gentle path.  For my heart’s desire Unto thine is bent:                   I aspire To a full consent.  Not a word or look I affect to own,                   But by book, And thy book alone.  Though I fail, I weep: Though I halt in pace,                   Yet I creep To the throne of grace.  Then let wrath remove; Love will do the deed:                   For with love Stony hearts will bleed.  Love is swift of foot; Love’s a man of war,                   And can shoot, And can hit from far.  Who can ’scape his bow? That which wrought on thee,                   Brought thee low, Needs must work on me.  Throw away thy rod; Though man frailties hath,          Thou art God: Throw away thy wrath.

The brown girl, golden, sable-eyed,
flourishing yellow hibiscus,
steps exuberant, august,
into August—
her lushly brocaded gold silk sari
lavishing honey light at her auburn feet,
sandalled, cedarly,
with scent of sandalwood haloing her,
her individualized, warm, light-dark body,
her every glance a direction of the air,
her look of mischievous—even tart—sweetness....
O has she...?
She has
come in from morning’s slight autumnal chill,
her feet moistened with diamantine dew—
how the sea summers in grass
(that same grass that rears at the sun
while butterflies mob frangipani...).
Behold her smile declaring
warm, sun-dyed, terracotta lips—
that chance come home—
and I answer,
“You are light uplifting,
liberating me from murk,
from an inferno of squalor.”
O! Let there be rum and molasses,
rice and mackerel, O Muse,
the Indian Ocean softening and sweetening the Atlantic,
this august autumn.
All these pleasures we will prove:
lotus like slow-motion lightning,
ivory gold fountaining from earth,
like you, a fresh light, sprung from earth.

Town, a town,
But location
Over which the sun as it comes to it;   
Which cools, houses and lamp-posts,
    during the night, with the roads—
Inhabited partly by those
Who have been born here,
Houses built—. From a train one sees
    him in the morning, his morning;   
Him in the afternoon, straightening—
People everywhere, time and the work
    pauseless:
One moves between reading and re-reading,   
The shape is a moment.
From a crowd a white powdered face,   
Eyes and mouth making three—
Awaited—locally—a date. 
* 
Near your eyes—
Love at the pelvis
Reaches the generic, gratuitous
                   (Your eyes like snail-tracks) 
Parallel emotions,
We slide in separate hard grooves   
Bowstrings to bent loins,
                     Self moving
Moon, mid-air. 
* 
Fragonard,
Your spiral women   
By a fountain 
‘1732’ 
Your picture lasts thru us 
                  its air
Thick with succession of civilizations;   
And the women. 
* 
No interval of manner
Your body in the sun.
You? A solid, this that the dress
                        insisted,
Your face unaccented, your mouth a mouth?   
                        Practical knees:
It is you who truly
Excel the vegetable,
The fitting of grasses—more bare than   
                        that.
Pointedly bent, your elbow on a car-edge   
Incognito as summer
Among mechanics. 
* 
‘O city ladies’
Your coats wrapped,   
Your hips a possession 
Your shoes arched   
Your walk is sharp 
Your breasts
         Pertain to lingerie 
The fields are road-sides,   
Rooms outlast you. 
* 
Bad times:
The cars pass
By the elevated posts   
And the movie sign.   
A man sells post-cards. 
* 
It brightens up into the branches   
And against the same buildings 
A morning:
His job is as regular.

They lie in parallel rows,
on ice, head to tail,
each a foot of luminosity 
barred with black bands,
which divide the scales’
radiant sections 
like seams of lead
in a Tiffany window.
Iridescent, watery 
prismatics: think abalone,
the wildly rainbowed
mirror of a soapbubble sphere, 
think sun on gasoline.
Splendor, and splendor,
and not a one in any way 
distinguished from the other
—nothing about them
of individuality. Instead 
they’re all exact expressions
of the one soul,
each a perfect fulfilment 
of heaven’s template,
mackerel essence. As if,
after a lifetime arriving 
at this enameling, the jeweler’s
made uncountable examples,
each as intricate 
in its oily fabulation
as the one before
Suppose we could iridesce, 
like these, and lose ourselves
entirely in the universe
of shimmer—would you want 
to be yourself only,
unduplicatable, doomed
to be lost? They’d prefer, 
plainly, to be flashing participants,
multitudinous. Even now
they seem to be bolting 
forward, heedless of stasis.
They don’t care they’re dead
and nearly frozen, 
just as, presumably,
they didn’t care that they were living:
all, all for all, 
the rainbowed school
and its acres of brilliant classrooms,
in which no verb is singular, 
or every one is. How happy they seem,
even on ice, to be together, selfless,
which is the price of gleaming.

In the ditch, half-ton sections of cast-iron molds
hand-greased at the seams with pale petroleum waste
and screw-clamped into five-hundred-gallon cylinders
drummed with rubber-headed sledges inside and out
to settle tight the wet concrete
that, dried and caulked, became Monarch Septic Tanks;
and, across the ditch, my high school football coach,
Don Compo, spunky pug of a man,
bronze and bald, all biceps and pecs,
raging at some “attitude” of mine
he snipped from our argument about Vietnam—
I mean raging, scarlet, veins bulging from his neck,
he looked like a hard-on stalking back and forth—
but I had started college, this was a summer job,
I no longer had to take his self-righteous, hectoring shit,
so I was chuckling merrily, saying he was ludicrous,
and he was calling me “College Man Ryan”
and, with his steel-toed workboot, kicking dirt
that clattered against the molds and puffed up between us. 
It’s probably not like this anymore, but every coach
in my hometown was a lunatic. Each had different quirks
we mimicked, beloved bromides whose parodies we intoned,
but they all conducted practice like boot camp,
the same tirades and abuse, no matter the sport,
the next game the next battle in a neverending war.
Ex-paratroopers and -frogmen, at least three
finally convicted child molesters, genuine sadists
fixated on the Commie menace and our American softness
that was personally bringing the country to the brink of collapse—
in this company, Don Compo didn’t even seem crazy.
He had never touched any of us;
his violence was verbal, which we were used to,
having gotten it from our fathers
and given it back to our brothers and one another
since we had been old enough to button our own pants.
Any minute—no guessing what might trigger it—
he could be butting your face mask and barking up your nostrils,
but generally he favored an unruffled, moralistic carping,
in which I, happy to spot phoniness,
saw pride and bitterness masquerading as teaching.
In the locker room, I’d sit where I could roll my eyeballs
as he droned, but, across the ditch,
he wasn’t lecturing, but fuming, flaring
as I had never seen in four years of football,
and it scared and thrilled me to defy him and mock him
when he couldn’t make me handwash jockstraps after practice
or do pushups on my fingertips in a mud puddle. 
But it was myself I was taunting. I could see my retorts
snowballing toward his threat to leap the ditch
and beat me to a puddle of piss (“you craphead,
you wiseass”), and my unspading a shovel from a dirt pile
and grasping its balance deliberately down the handle
and inviting him to try it.
Had he come I would have hit him,
There’s no question about that.
For a moment, it ripped through our bewilderment,
which then closed over again
like the ocean
if an immense cast-iron mold were dropped in.
I was fired when the boss broke the tableau.
“The rest of you,” he said, “have work to do,”
and, grabbing a hammer and chisel, Don Compo
mounted the mold between us in the ditch
and with one short punch split it down the seam.

Let it no longer be a forlorn hope          To wash an Ethiope; He’s wash’d, his gloomy skin a peaceful shade,          For his white soul is made; And now, I doubt not, the Eternal Dove          A black-fac’d house will love.

Sometimes you watch them going out to sea
On such a day as this, in the worst of weathers,
Their boat holding ten or a dozen of them,
In black rubber suits crouched around the engine housing,
Tanks of air, straps and hoses, and for their feet
Enormous flippers. 
                                 The bow, with such a load on board,
Hammers through the whitecaps, while they talk;
Junonian girls, Praxitelean boys, pelted on
By bursting clouds, by spray, eventually heave
The tanks upon their backs, the boat drifts at anchor, 
And down they go to the sea floor, by the foggy headland.
At least, you can presume they kick the flippers
And plunge to where the water is more calm. The cool
Instructors must keep eyes and ears
Open. Accidents out there, they happen. 
                                        You might imagine scraps
Of cultural débris, a broken pot, a ring, a cogwheel
Come up, clutched in a palm, and interesting,
A wave pattern in it, the blade of a sword,
When a lucky diver breaks again the surface. Time,
Time and again frigate and schooner cracked
Blown against the rocks, holed below the water line. 
                                        Even an inscription
Might now be coming up from those green deeps.
Yet the divers do their silent thing. On the sea floor
Expect only the sea, a multitude of sand without an hourglass.
Round somebody’s ankle idly it swarms. A diver
Hangs by a thread of breath in solitude there. Some go down
In all simplicity curious; to have tales to tell;
And who knows, what they learn
Just might, long after this, be usable.

“Do you remember me? or are you proud?” Lightly advancing thro’ her star-trimm’d crowd,          Ianthe said, and lookt into my eyes, “A yes, a yes, to both: for Memory Where you but once have been must ever be,          And at your voice Pride from his throne must rise.”

‘Dockery was junior to you,
Wasn’t he?’ said the Dean. ‘His son’s here now.’   
Death-suited, visitant, I nod. ‘And do
You keep in touch with—’ Or remember how   
Black-gowned, unbreakfasted, and still half-tight   
We used to stand before that desk, to give   
‘Our version’ of ‘these incidents last night’?   
I try the door of where I used to live: 
Locked. The lawn spreads dazzlingly wide.
A known bell chimes. I catch my train, ignored.   
Canal and clouds and colleges subside
Slowly from view. But Dockery, good Lord,   
Anyone up today must have been born
In ’43, when I was twenty-one.
If he was younger, did he get this son
At nineteen, twenty? Was he that withdrawn 
High-collared public-schoolboy, sharing rooms
With Cartwright who was killed? Well, it just shows   
How much ... How little ... Yawning, I suppose
I fell asleep, waking at the fumes
And furnace-glares of Sheffield, where I changed,   
And ate an awful pie, and walked along   
The platform to its end to see the ranged   
Joining and parting lines reflect a strong 
Unhindered moon. To have no son, no wife,   
No house or land still seemed quite natural.   
Only a numbness registered the shock   
Of finding out how much had gone of life,   
How widely from the others. Dockery, now:   
Only nineteen, he must have taken stock
Of what he wanted, and been capable
Of ... No, that’s not the difference: rather, how 
Convinced he was he should be added to!
Why did he think adding meant increase?
To me it was dilution. Where do these
Innate assumptions come from? Not from what   
We think truest, or most want to do:
Those warp tight-shut, like doors. They’re more a style   
Our lives bring with them: habit for a while,
Suddenly they harden into all we’ve got 
And how we got it; looked back on, they rear   
Like sand-clouds, thick and close, embodying   
For Dockery a son, for me nothing,
Nothing with all a son’s harsh patronage.   
Life is first boredom, then fear.
Whether or not we use it, it goes,
And leaves what something hidden from us chose,   
And age, and then the only end of age.

After my father’s cremation,
my sisters and I agreed
to bury him privately
when the ground thawed.
One will plant a flowering tree,
one see to the stone and its cutting,
one call the grave digger and the town clerk.
It’ll be just us, the daughters,
presiding over ashes that could be
any mammal’s, or those of any love
dispersible by wind. 
Let’s bury the secret violence to his dogs,
Pompey and Tara, Juba and Molly,
their ashes already gone to this ground.
And his “escapades,” as Mom called them.
Here withers that branch of the tree. 
Let’s bury the ring inscribed In perpetuum ave atque vale (translated
“Hail and farewell” by my father,
“Hello, and good-bye forever” by Mom,
a token dating back to the First Separation)
and a tennis ball for canine shades. Your dad is with his dogs now,
said more than one person at the funeral. 
It’ll be just us, the three inheritors,
on a raw windy day in Death’s kingdom,
lifting our eyes from the hole
to the mountains hazed with spring,
saying, In perpetuum ave atque vale,
minor god of our father.
Let’s each of us drop a few
dog biscuits into his grave.


^^EOP^^

As if there could be a world
Of absolute innocence
In which we forget ourselves 
The owners throw sticks
And half-bald tennis balls
Toward the surf
And the happy dogs leap after them
As if catapulted— 
Black dogs, tan dogs,
Tubes of glorious muscle— 
Pursuing pleasure
More than obedience
They race, skid to a halt in the wet sand,
Sometimes they'll plunge straight into
The foaming breakers 
Like diving birds, letting the green turbulence
Toss them, until they snap and sink 
Teeth into floating wood
Then bound back to their owners
Shining wet, with passionate speed
For nothing,
For absolutely nothing but joy.


^^EOP^^

Doing, a filthy pleasure is, and short;And done, we straight repent us of the sport:Let us not then rush blindly on unto it,Like lustful beasts, that only know to do it:For lust will languish, and that heat decay.But thus, thus, keeping endless holiday,Let us together closely lie and kiss,There is no labour, nor no shame in this;This hath pleased, doth please, and long will please; neverCan this decay, but is beginning ever.

They are so like
Us, frozen in a bald passion
Or absent
Gaze, like the cows whose lashes
Sag beneath their frail sacks of ice.
Your eyes are white with fever, a long
Sickness. When you are asleep,
Dreaming of another country, the wheat’s
Pale surface sliding
In the wind, you are walking in every breath
Away from me. I gave you a stone doll,
Its face a dry apple, wizened, yet untroubled.
It taught us the arrogance of silence,
How stone and God reward us, how dolls give us
Nothing. Look at your cane,
Look how even the touch that wears it away
Draws up a shine, as the handle
Gives to the hand. As a girl, you boiled
Your dolls, to keep them clean, presentable;
You’d stir them in enormous pots,
As the arms and legs bent to those incredible
Postures you preferred, not that ordinary, human
Pose. How would you like me?—
Leaning back, reading aloud from a delirious
Book. Or sprawled across your bed,
As if I’d been tossed off a high building
Into the street,
A lesson from a young government to its people.
When you are asleep, walking the fields of another
Country, a series of shadows slowly falling
Away, marking a way,
The sky leaning like a curious girl above a new
Sister, your face a doll’s deliberate
Ache of white, you walk along that grove of madness,
Where your mother waits. Hungry, very still.
When you are asleep, dreaming of another country,
This is the country.

Night after night forever the dolls lay stiff
by the children’s dreams. On the goose-feathers of the rich,
on the straw of the poor, on the gypsy ground—
wherever the children slept, dolls have been found
in the subsoil of the small loves stirred again
by the Finders After Everything. Down lay
the children by their hanks and twists. Night after night
grew over imagination. The fuzzies shed, the bright
buttons fell out of the heads, arms ripped, and down
through goose-feathers, straw; and the gypsy ground
the dolls sank, and some—the fuzziest and most loved
changed back to string and dust, and the dust moved
dream-puffs round the Finders’ boots as they dug,
sieved, brushed, and came on a little clay dog,
and a little stone man, and a little bone girl, that had kept
their eyes wide open forever, while all the children slept.


^^EOP^^

Through the Victorians
spinning a wool of music
the gang in the breeze
Boys and girls headed toward the
park
No longer in my view
Wondering now what they doing
How they divide
Hold hands
Lay on benches
Breathe 
Dolores park green waving
mounds
where downtown looks like you
could stretch and scratch it
You can see the water
smaller the other side
connected with the bay bridge
from this angle
Appears as a cowboy rope
Lasso 
Back to the park
the across the street is windows
Suggest
Eyes which could have been looking
at savannahs / stretches
had it not been for transportation
The city settling
Up from planks and kerosense lamps
Rugged 
Small vocabularies full of passion
Found a gold sliver on the way
to my fruits
Raise the air fair
Let the news out
Rush like Hawaiian beer 
The big radio of the teenagers
comes again
looking through the curtain
Look them wasted
Clothes wrinkled
Eyes fresh like just arrived mushrooms
they move to the interior of the Mission
where they hang out / generations on the streets


^^EOP^^




for John Godfrey



1. Animals 
Carved—indicated, actually, from solid
Blocks of wood, the copper-, cream-, and chocolate-colored   
Cows we bought in Salzburg form a tiny herd.
          And in Dr. Gachet’s etching, six
Or seven universal poses are assumed by cats.  Misery, hypocrisy, greed: A dying
Mouse, a cat, and a flock of puzzled blackbirds wearing   
Uniforms and frock coats exhibit these traits.
          Formally outlasting the motive
Of their creation with a poetry at once too vague 
And too precise to do anything with but
Worship, they seem to have just blundered into our lives   
By accident, completely comprehending
          Everything we find so disturbing
About them; but they never speak. They never even move 
From the positions in which Grandville or some   
Anonymous movie-poster artist has left them,   
A sort of ghostly wolf, a lizard, an ape
          And a huge dog. And their eyes, looking   
At nothing, manage to see everything invisible 
To ours, even with all the time in the world
To see everything we think we have to see. And tell   
Of this in the only way we really can:
          With a remark as mild as the air
In which it is to be left hanging; or a stiff scream, 
Folded like a sheet of paper over all
The horrible memories of everything we were   
Going to have. That vanished before our eyes
          As we woke up to nothing but these,
Our words, poor animals whose home is in another world.  
       2. Summer Home 
Tiny outbursts of sunlight play
On the tips of waves that look like tacks   
Strewn on the surface of the bay.
Up the coast the water backs up
Behind a lofty, wooded island. Here,   
According to photographs, it is less
Turbulent and blue; but much clearer.   
It seems to exercise the sunlight less   
Reflecting it, allowing beaten silver sheets
To roam like water across a kitchen floor.   
Having begun gradually, the gravel beach   
Ends abruptly in the forest on the shore. 
Looked at from a distance, the forest seems   
Haunted. But safe within its narrow room   
Its light is innocent and green, as though   
Emerging from another dream of diminution   
We found ourselves of normal, human size,   
Attempting to touch the leaves above our heads.   
Why couldn’t we have spent our summers here,   
Surrounded and growing up again? Or perhaps   
Arrive here late at night by car, much later   
In life? If only heaven were not too near   
For such sadness. And not within this world   
Which heaven has finally made clear. 
Green lichen fastened to a blue rock
Like a map of the spot; cobwebs crowded with stars   
Of water; battalions of small white flowers.   
Such clarity, unrelieved except by our   
Delight and daily acquiescence in it,   
Presumably the effect of a natural setting   
Like this one, with all its expectations of ecstasy   
And peace, demands a future of forgetting   
Everything that sustains it: the dead leaves
Of winter; the new leaves of spring which summer burns   
Into different kinds of happiness; for these,   
When autumn drops its tear upon them, turn.  
       3. Domes 
“Pleased in proportion to the truth
Depicted by means of familiar images.” That
One was dazed; the other I left in a forest   
Surrounded by giant, sobering pines.   
For I had to abandon those lives.   
Their burden of living had become   
Mine and it was like dying: alone,
Huddled under the cold blue dome of the stars,
Still fighting what died and so close to myself I could not even see.   
I kept trying to look at myself. It was like looking into the sun and I went blind. 
O, to break open that inert light
Like a stone and let the vision slowly sink down
Into the texture of things, like a comb flowing through dark,   
Heavy hair; and to continue to be affected much later.   
I was getting so tired of that excuse: refusing love
Until it might become so closely mated to its birth in   
Acts and words of love; until a soft monstrosity of song
Might fuse these moments of affection with a dream of home;   
The cold, prolonged proximity of God long after night   
Has come and only starlight trickles through the dome; 
And yet I only wanted to be happy.
I wanted rest and innocence; a place
Where I could hide each secret fear by blessing it,
By letting it survive inside those faces I could never understand,   
Love, or bear to leave. Because I wanted peace, bruised with prayer   
I tried to crawl inside the heavy, slaughtered hands of love
And never move. And then I felt the wound unfold inside me   
Like a stab of paradise: explode: and then at last
Exhausted, heal into pain. And that was happiness:
A dream whose ending never ends, a vein 
Of blood, a hollow entity
Consumed by consummation, bleeding so.
In the sky our eyes ascend to as they sweep
Upwards into emptiness, the angels sing their listless   
Lullabies and children wake up glistening with screams
They left asleep; and the dead are dead. The wounded worship death
And live a little while in love; and then are gone.
Inside the dome the stars assume the outlines of their lives:   
Until we know, until we come to recognize as ours,
Those other lives that live within us as our own.

If, when studying road atlases
while taking, as you call it, your   
morning dump, you shout down to   
me names like Miami City, Franconia,   
Cancún, as places for you to take   
me to from here, can I help it if 
all I can think is things that are   
stupid, like he loves me he loves me   
not? I don’t think so. No more
than, some mornings, waking to your   
hands around me, and remembering   
these are the fingers, the hands I’ve 
over and over given myself to, I can   
stop myself from wondering does that   
mean they’re the same I’ll grow   
old with. Yesterday, in the café I   
keep meaning to show you, I thought   
this is how I’ll die maybe, alone, 
somewhere too far away from wherever   
you are then, my heart racing from   
espresso and too many cigarettes,   
my head down on the table’s cool   
marble, and the ceiling fan turning   
slowly above me, like fortune, the 
part of fortune that’s half-wished-
for only—it did not seem the worst   
way. I thought this is another of   
those things I’m always forgetting   
to tell you, or don’t choose to   
tell you, or I tell you but only 
in the same way, each morning, I
keep myself from saying too loud I
love you until the moment you flush
the toilet, then I say it, when the
rumble of water running down through
the house could mean anything: flood, 
your feet descending the stairs any
moment; any moment the whole world,
all I want of the world, coming down.

It was nearly daylight when she gave birth to the child,
lying on a quilt
he had doubled up for her.
He put the child on his left arm
and took it out of the room,
and she could hear the splashing water.
When he came back
she asked him where the child was.
He replied: “Out there—in the water.”
He punched up the fire
and returned with an armload of wood
and the child,
and put the dead child into the fire.
She said: “O John, don't!”
He did not reply
but turned to her and smiled. 
                                          2 
Late at night, their sow rooted open the door of their cabin,
and husband and wife
quarreled over driving her out.
His wife knocked him down with an iron shovel.
He started for his breeches and said,
“If I had my knife, I'd cut your throat,”
and she ran out the door.
He shut the door after her
and propped it closed with a stick of wood. 
When she was found, she was lying on her face,
frozen to death. The weather extremely cold
and where she lay
the snow was about eighteen inches deep. 
When she left the cabin, she was barefoot
and had very little clothing. The way she took
led through briers
and there were drops of blood on the snow—
where the briers had torn her legs from the knees down—
and bits of clothing that had been torn off;
at one place
she had struck her ankle against the end of a log
and it bled freely. 
                                       3 
Mrs. Farborough went into her brother's house,
leaving her husband a short distance from it—
he was the best man of the neighborhood for strength—
and, without speaking to anyone,
seized a tin cup.
Her sister-in-law said it seemed as if she took a good deal of authority there.
Mrs. Farborough replied she took enough to get her things,
and would also take her teakettle.
Mrs. Eller told her to take them
and get out of the house
and stay out. 
Mrs. Farborough did go out
but soon returned with a stone—
as large as her fist—
which she held under her apron,
and sat down,
remarking that she intended to stay a while
just for aggravation.
Farborough then approached the house with a stone in each hand
and, when near it, sat on a log.
After a moment or two,
he sprang into the house,
the stones still in his hands.
At this, his wife threw the stone she held under her apron
at her sister-in-law:
missed and struck the side of the house near her head.
The women clinched and fell to the floor,
Mrs. Farborough on top,
hitting Mrs. Eller in the face with her fist. 
Eller went up to Farborough and said:
“Brother Martin,
take your wife out of here,
and I will take care of mine.
Let us have no fuss!”
And he started forward to part the women,
still fighting.
Farnborough pushed him back:
“God damn you, stand back,
or I will kill the last Goddamn one of you!”
and lifted his right hand,
holding the stone. 
He turned to look at the women,
and Eller shot him in the back with a pistol,
just where his suspenders crossed. 
                                        4 
He and his wife were members of a society
known as Knights and Ladies of Honor.
The life of each member was insured for two thousand dollars—
to go to widow or widower.
He had to borrow money to pay his dues
and had just been defeated for town marshal;
and now his wife was sick. 
The Knight of Honor was seen in a saloon with a Negro
who used to work for him;
then the two were seen going into an alley.
Here he gave the Negro a quarter
and asked him to go to the drugstore
and buy a small bottle of strychnine.
If the druggist asked the Negro why he wanted it,
he was to say to kill wolves on a farm.
The Negro asked him what he really wanted it for
and he said to poison the dogs
belonging to a neighbor where a girl was working
whom he wanted to visit at night.
The Negro bought him the bottle,
and he told the Negro that if questioned about it
he must say that he put it in the pocket of his overcoat
and left the coat hanging in a saloon,
and that the bottle was taken from his pocket
by someone. 
When his wife asked for the quinine
she used as a medicine,
he went to the mantelpiece
where he had placed a package of quinine
bought the day before
and poured some of the strychnine into a spoonful of cold coffee.
She thought the powder had a peculiar look,
and tried to dissolve it
by stirring it with her finger.
He assured her it was quinine
bought where he had always bought it;   
and she drank it.

1. 
It was winter, lunar, wet. At dusk
Pewter seedlings became moonlight orphans. Pleased to meet you meat to please you
said the butcher's sign in the window in the village. 
Everything changed the year that we got married.
And after that we moved out to the suburbs.
How young we were, how ignorant, how ready
to think the only history was our own. 
And there was a couple who quarreled into the night,
Their voices high, sharp:
nothing is ever entirely
right in the lives of those who love each other. 
               2. 
In that season suddenly our island
Broke out its old sores for all to see.
We saw them too.
We stood there wondering how 
the salt horizons and the Dublin hills,
the rivers, table mountains, Viking marshes
we thought we knew
had been made to shiver 
into our ancient twelve by fifteen television
which gave them back as gray and grayer tears
and killings, killings, killings,
then moonlight-colored funerals: 
nothing we said
not then, not later,
fathomed what it is
is wrong in the lives of those who hate each other. 
             3. 
And if the provenance of memory is
only that—remember, not atone—
and if I can be safe in
the weak spring light in that kitchen, then 
why is there another kitchen, spring light
always darkening in it and
a woman whispering to a man
over and over what else could we have done? 
               4. 
We failed our moment or our moment failed us.
The times were grand in size and we were small.
Why do I write that
when I don't believe it? 
We lived our lives, were happy, stayed as one.
Children were born and raised here
and are gone,
including ours. 
As for that couple did we ever
find out who they were
and did we want to?
I think we know. I think we always knew.

A father tells his son the thing he regrets most about his life is the amount of time he has spent worrying about it.
   

Worry 1. A dog’s action of biting and shaking an animal so as to injure or kill it, spec., a hound’s worrying of its quarry; an instance of this. 2. A state or feeling of mental unease or anxiety regarding or arising from one’s cares or responsibilities, uncertainty about the future, fear of failure, etc.; anxious concern, anxiety. Also, an instance or cause of this.
 

It achieved nothing, all his worrying. Things worked out or they didn’t work out and now here he was, an old man, an old man who each year of his life bit or shook doubt as if to injure if not to kill, an old man with a good-looking son who resembles his deceased mother. It is uncanny how she rests there, as plain as day, in their boy's face.
   

Worry 8. Cause mental distress or agitation to (a person, oneself); make anxious and ill at ease. 9. Give way to anxiety, unease, or disquietude: allow one’s mind to dwell on difficulties or troubles.
 

He waits for his father’s death. His father has been taken off the ventilator and clearly will not be able to breathe for himself much longer. Earlier in the day the nurse mentioned something about an electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures brain waves in the cerebral hemispheres, the parts of the brain that deal with speech and memory. But his brain stem is damaged; it seems now the test will not be necessary. The son expects an almost silent, hollow gasp to come from the old man’s open mouth. Those final sounds, however, are nothing like the wind moving through the vacancy of a mind. The release is jerky and convulsive. There is never the rasp or the choke the son expects, though one meaning of worry is to be choked on, to choke on.

There is a button on the remote control called FAV. You can program your favorite channels. Don’t like the world you live in, choose one closer to the world you live in. I choose the independent film channel and HBO. Neither have news programs as far as I can tell. This is what is great about America—anyone can make these kinds of choices. Instead of the news, HBO has The Sopranos. This week the indie channel is playing and replaying Spaghetti Westerns. Always someone gets shot or pierced through the heart with an arrow, and just before he dies he says, I am not going to make it. Where? Not going to make it where? On some level, maybe, the phrase simply means not going to make it into the next day, hour, minute, or perhaps the next second. Occasionally, you can imagine, it means he is not going to make it to Carson City or Texas or somewhere else out west or to Mexico if he is on the run. On another level always implicit is the sense that it means he is not going to make it to his own death. Perhaps in the back of all our minds is the life expectancy for our generation. Perhaps this expectation lingers there alongside the hours of sleep one should get or the number of times one is meant to chew food—eight hours, twenty chews, and seventy-six years. We are all heading there and not to have that birthday is not to have made it.

Don’t let that horse
                              eat that violin 
    cried Chagall’s mother 
                                     But he   
                      kept right on
                                     painting 
And became famous 
And kept on painting
                              The Horse With Violin In Mouth 
And when he finally finished it
he jumped up upon the horse
                                        and rode away   
          waving the violin 
And then with a low bow gave it
to the first naked nude he ran across  
And there were no strings

Done is a battle on the dragon black,
Our champion Christ confoundit has his force;
The yetis of hell are broken with a crack,
The sign triumphal raisit is of the cross,
The devillis trymmillis with hiddous voce,
The saulis are borrowit and to the bliss can go,
Christ with his bloud our ransonis dois indoce: Surrexit Dominus de sepulchro. 
Dungan is the deidly dragon Lucifer,
The cruewall serpent with the mortal stang;
The auld kene tiger, with his teith on char,
Whilk in a wait has lyen for us so lang,
Thinking to grip us in his clawis strang;
The merciful Lord wald nocht that it were so,
He made him for to failye of that fang. Surrexit Dominus de sepulchro. 
He for our saik that sufferit to be slane,
And lyk a lamb in sacrifice was dicht,
Is lyk a lion risen up agane,
And as a gyane raxit him on hicht;
Sprungen is Aurora radious and bricht,
On loft is gone the glorious Apollo,
The blissful day departit fro the nicht: Surrexit Dominus de sepulchro. 
The grit victour again is rissen on hicht,
That for our querrell to the deth was woundit;
The sun that wox all pale now shynis bricht,
And, derkness clearit, our faith is now refoundit;
The knell of mercy fra the heaven is soundit,
The Christin are deliverit of their wo,
The Jowis and their errour are confoundit: Surrexit Dominus de sepulchro. 
The fo is chasit, the battle is done ceis,
The presone broken, the jevellouris fleit and flemit;
The weir is gon, confermit is the peis,
The fetteris lowsit and the dungeon temit,
The ransoun made, the prisoneris redeemit;
The field is won, owrecomen is the fo,
Dispuilit of the treasure that he yemit: Surrexit Dominus de sepulchro.

for Robert Duncan



It is hard going to the door
cut so small in the wall where
the vision which echoes loneliness   
brings a scent of wild flowers in a wood. 
What I understood, I understand.
My mind is sometime torment,   
sometimes good and filled with livelihood,   
and feels the ground. 
But I see the door,
and knew the wall, and wanted the wood,   
and would get there if I could
with my feet and hands and mind. 
Lady, do not banish me   
for digressions. My nature   
is a quagmire of unresolved   
confessions. Lady, I follow. 
I walked away from myself,
I left the room, I found the garden,
I knew the woman
in it, together we lay down. 
Dead night remembers. In December   
we change, not multiplied but dispersed,   
sneaked out of childhood,
the ritual of dismemberment. 
Mighty magic is a mother,
in her there is another issue
of fixture, repeated form, the race renewal,   
the charge of the command. 
The garden echoes across the room.   
It is fixed in the wall like a mirror   
that faces a window behind you   
and reflects the shadows. 
May I go now?
Am I allowed to bow myself down
in the ridiculous posture of renewal,
of the insistence of which I am the virtue? 
Nothing for You is untoward.   
Inside You would also be tall,   
more tall, more beautiful.
Come toward me from the wall, I want to be with You. 
So I screamed to You,
who hears as the wind, and changes   
multiply, invariably,
changes in the mind. 
Running to the door, I ran down
as a clock runs down. Walked backwards,   
stumbled, sat down
hard on the floor near the wall. 
Where were You.
How absurd, how vicious.
There is nothing to do but get up.
My knees were iron, I rusted in worship, of You. 
For that one sings, one
writes the spring poem, one goes on walking.   
The Lady has always moved to the next town   
and you stumble on after Her. 
The door in the wall leads to the garden   
where in the sunlight sit
the Graces in long Victorian dresses,   
of which my grandmother had spoken. 
History sings in their faces.
They are young, they are obtainable,   
and you follow after them also
in the service of God and Truth. 
But the Lady is indefinable,   
she will be the door in the wall   
to the garden in sunlight.   
I will go on talking forever. 
I will never get there.
Oh Lady, remember me
who in Your service grows older   
not wiser, no more than before. 
How can I die alone.
Where will I be then who am now alone,   
what groans so pathetically
in this room where I am alone? 
I will go to the garden.
I will be a romantic. I will sell   
myself in hell,
in heaven also I will be. 
In my mind I see the door,
I see the sunlight before me across the floor   
beckon to me, as the Lady’s skirt
moves small beyond it.

Driving through   
hot brushy country
in the late autumn,   
I saw a hawk
crucified on a
barbed-wire fence. 
I guess as a kind   
of advertisement   
to other hawks,   
saying from the pages
of a leading women’s   
   magazine, 
“She’s beautiful,
but burn all the maps   
to your body.
I’m not here
of my own choosing.”

Well aren't you the harsh necessity,
As in what fear is for?
It was the summer of You should have been there,
Though the last thing I want
Anywhere near me is you.
Louche and thaumaturgic,
You made my faith
My foolishness—
Easy as lying to trees.
Essence of the inessential
Is what you are, double rainbow,
Extrinsic as blood is to stars,
An empire not of death,
But inspired by death,
Farrago of arid precepts,
A few cheap ideas about hope,
The eschaton, alterity,
All featuring you.
What are the chances?
Slim to none.
But listen here, my fraud, my forger,
I could close my eyes at any time.
All I have to do is close my eyes.

The doubt of future foes exiles my present joy, And wit me warns to shun such snares as threaten mine annoy; For falsehood now doth flow, and subjects’ faith doth ebb, Which should not be if reason ruled or wisdom weaved the web. But clouds of joys untried do cloak aspiring minds, Which turn to rain of late repent by changed course of winds. The top of hope supposed the root upreared shall be, And fruitless all their grafted guile, as shortly ye shall see. The dazzled eyes with pride, which great ambition blinds, Shall be unsealed by worthy wights whose foresight falsehood finds. The daughter of debate that discord aye doth sow Shall reap no gain where former rule still peace hath taught to know. No foreign banished wight shall anchor in this port; Our realm brooks not seditious sects, let them elsewhere resort. My rusty sword through rest shall first his edge employ To poll their tops that seek such change or gape for future joy.

Could you come back to me, Douglas, Douglas,In the old likeness that I knew,I would be so faithful, so loving, Douglas,Douglas, Douglas, tender and true.
Never a scornful word should grieve ye,I’d smile on ye sweet as the angels do,—Sweet as your smile on me shone ever,Douglas, Douglas, tender and true.
Oh, to call back the days that are not!My eyes were blinded, your words were few;Do you know the truth now up in heaven,Douglas, Douglas, tender and true?
I never was worthy of you, Douglas;Not half worthy the like of you:Now all men beside seem to me like shadows—I love you, Douglas, tender and true.
Stretch out your hand to me, Douglas, Douglas,Drop forgiveness from heaven like dew;As I lay my heart on your dead heart, Douglas,Douglas, Douglas, tender and true.

Southbound, downwardly mobile in
A knocking ten-year-old LeSabre,
Totaled once and salvaged, rust
Gnawing at the rocker panels like
Fire at the curtains in a melodrama,
I imagine those for whom such news
Must matter: sauve, smooth-featured types,
Untroubled by the odd details
Of racing forms or powerball,
Who, while I drove truck or counted stock,
Were wisely planning their estates,
Diversifying portfolios, or buying
A summer place with acreage. 
Yet how their evening now is shot!
How flat the chardonnay, how bland
The tips of tenderloin must taste!
Of course, it’s not the Dow alone—
The dollar’s through the roof, T-bills
Have plunged, and, even now, the wife
Is pussyfooting at the club.
How birdsong-sweet and full of joy
Seems my life by comparison:
The Gulf’s two hours off, where rigs
Pound at the solar plexus of
The earth, and where, on moonlit nights,
Perfumed mulattoes weave like snails
By the shore, leaving shining trails.

Down by the salley gardens
   my love and I did meet;
She passed the salley gardens
   with little snow-white feet.
She bid me take love easy,
   as the leaves grow on the tree;
But I, being young and foolish,
   with her would not agree. 
In a field by the river
   my love and I did stand,
And on my leaning shoulder
   she laid her snow-white hand.
She bid me take life easy,
   as the grass grows on the weirs;
But I was young and foolish,
   and now am full of tears.

“The writer. It’s a cul-de-sac,” you wrote that
winter of our nation’s discontent. That first time
I found you, blue marble lying still in the trench, you, staked
in waiting for something, anything but the cell of your small
apartment with the fixtures never scrubbed, the seven great
named cats you gassed in the move. I couldn’t keep them.
You explained so I understood. And what cat never loved
your shell-like ways, the claw of your steady fingers, firme
from the rasping of banjos and steady as it goes
from the nose to the hair to the shaking tip. My favorite
tale was of the owl and the pussycat in love in a china cup
cast at sea, or in a flute more brittle, more lifelike
and riddled with flair, the exquisite polish of its gaudy
glaze now puzzled with heat cracks, now foamed
opalescent as the single espresso dish you bought from
Goodwill. What ever becomes of the heart our common
child fashioned, red silk and golden satin, the gay glitter
fallen from moves, our names with Love written in black
felt pen? Who gets what? Who knows what becomes of the
rose you carried home from Spanish Harlem that morning
I sat waiting for the surgeon’s suction. What ever becomes
of waiting and wanting, when the princess isn’t ready and
the queen has missed the boat, again? Do you still write
those old remarks etched on a page of Kandinsky’s ace
letting go? Like: Lorna meets Oliver North and she
kicks his butt

At first he seemed a child,
dirt on his lip and the sun
lighting up his hair behind him. 
All around us, the hesitation
of year-rounders who know
the warmer air will bring crowds. 
No one goes to their therapist
to talk about how happy they are,
but soon I’d be back in the dugout 
telling my batting coach how
the view outside my igloo seemed
to be changing, as if the night 
sky were all the light there is.
Now, like two babies reaching
through the watery air to touch soft 
fingers to soft forehead, like blind fish
sensing a familiar fluttering in the waves,
slowly, by instinct, we became aware. 
Off-field, outside the park, beyond
the gates, something was burning.   
The smell was everywhere.

By a route obscure and lonely,   Haunted by ill angels only, Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,   On a black throne reigns upright, I have reached these lands but newly   From an ultimate dim Thule— From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,        Out of SPACE—Out of TIME.  Bottomless vales and boundless floods,   And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,   With forms that no man can discover   For the tears that drip all over;   Mountains toppling evermore   Into seas without a shore;   Seas that restlessly aspire,   Surging, unto skies of fire;   Lakes that endlessly outspread   Their lone waters—lone and dead,—   Their still waters—still and chilly   With the snows of the lolling lily.  By the lakes that thus outspread Their lone waters, lone and dead,— Their sad waters, sad and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily,— By the mountains—near the river   Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—   By the grey woods,—by the swamp   Where the toad and the newt encamp,—   By the dismal tarns and pools    Where dwell the Ghouls,—   By each spot the most unholy—   In each nook most melancholy,—   There the traveller meets, aghast,   Sheeted Memories of the Past—   Shrouded forms that start and sigh   As they pass the wanderer by—   White-robed forms of friends long given,   In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven.  For the heart whose woes are legion   ’T is a peaceful, soothing region—   For the spirit that walks in shadow   ’T is—oh, ’t is an Eldorado! But the traveller, travelling through it,   May not—dare not openly view it;   Never its mysteries are exposed   To the weak human eye unclosed;   So wills its King, who hath forbid   The uplifting of the fring'd lid;   And thus the sad Soul that here passes   Beholds it but through darkened glasses.  By a route obscure and lonely,   Haunted by ill angels only, Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, On a black throne reigns upright,   I have wandered home but newly   From this ultimate dim Thule.

         I
In the moonlight,
in the heavy snow,
I was hunting along
the sunken road
and heard behind me
the quiet step
and smothered whimper
of something following . . . 
Ah, tree of panic
I climbed
to escape the night,
as the furry body glided
beneath, lynx with   
steady gaze, and began
the slow ascent. 
         II
And dark blue foxes
climbed beside me with
famished eyes that   
glowed in the shadows; 
I stabbed with
a sharpened stick until
one lay across
the path with entrails
spilled, and
the others melted away. 
The dead fox
moved again, his jaws
released the
sound of speech. 
         III
Slowly I toiled
up the rotting stairs
to the cemetery
where my mother lay buried, 
to find the open grave
with the coffin
tilted beside it,
and something spilled
from the bottom— 
a whiteness that flowed
on the ground
and froze into mist that
enveloped the world.

Life, friends, is boring. We must not say so.   
After all, the sky flashes, the great sea yearns,   
we ourselves flash and yearn,
and moreover my mother told me as a boy   
(repeatingly) ‘Ever to confess you’re bored   
means you have no 
Inner Resources.’ I conclude now I have no   
inner resources, because I am heavy bored.
Peoples bore me,
literature bores me, especially great literature,   
Henry bores me, with his plights & gripes   
as bad as achilles, 
who loves people and valiant art, which bores me.   
And the tranquil hills, & gin, look like a drag   
and somehow a dog
has taken itself & its tail considerably away
into mountains or sea or sky, leaving            
behind: me, wag.


^^EOP^^

There sat down, once, a thing on Henry’s heart   
só heavy, if he had a hundred years
& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time   
Henry could not make good.
Starts again always in Henry’s ears
the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime. 
And there is another thing he has in mind   
like a grave Sienese face a thousand years
would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of. Ghastly,   
with open eyes, he attends, blind.
All the bells say: too late. This is not for tears;   
thinking. 
But never did Henry, as he thought he did,
end anyone and hacks her body up
and hide the pieces, where they may be found.
He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody’s missing.   
Often he reckons, in the dawn, them up.
Nobody is ever missing.

All trembling in my arms Aminta lay, Defending of the bliss I strove to take; Raising my rapture by her kind delay, Her force so charming was and weak. The soft resistance did betray the grant, While I pressed on the heaven of my desires; Her rising breasts with nimbler motions pant; Her dying eyes assume new fires. Now to the height of languishment she grows, And still her looks new charms put on; Now the last mystery of Love she knows, We sigh, and kiss: I waked, and all was done.  ‘Twas but a dream, yet by my heart I knew, Which still was panting, part of it was true: Oh how I strove the rest to have believed; Ashamed and angry to be undeceived!

1    There are few probabilities through
      Which dreamers do not pass. . . 
      The first dream
      Is the bright red dream
      Of our mother’s heart.
      It is her sacrifice
      Of something eternal
      In herself, for us.
      The Arabs say
      Blood has flowed
      Let us begin again. 
      The heart is like a cup, or a coffer,
      or a cave. It holds the image of the
      sun within us. It is a center of illumination
      and happiness and wisdom. To dream
      of the heart is always to dream of
      the importance of love. . . 
      The second dream is the inauguration
      Of the soul. In this dream we are
      Confronted by a host of birds. . . 
      Some were guileless
      Like the doves,

They sap man’s substance

A rope grows erect

A black swan hatches

And a flock of angels in the sky

on the skid pan. 
I dream, so I dream.
I dream
that three times three is nine,
that the right-hand
rule applies;
and when the circus leaves
the trampled ground will
once more overgrow with grass. 
Yes, grass.
Unequivocal grass.
Just grass.

I saw the hand of Rasputin
cast in bronze and used as an oversized
paperweight on someone’s desk.
The authentic hand. Smooth as Italian leather.
It was molded from plaster before he was killed.
Bought at an auction in Europe.
She was a collector.
She knew the value of everything. 
I wouldn’t like Rasputin’s hand
on my desk, even though it wore the skin
over its fine bones like a soft glove
and healed the tsarevitch.
I wouldn’t like her Samurai sword.
I’m glad I don’t know what I’m worth. 
There are days when the whole world
feels like somebody else’s collection.
Even your hands. We walk
in another country and the mist
slowly rises above the lake
like the heaviness we left,
dissolving.
Only it’s not our heaviness.

Sometimes, waking, I forget
where I am. The things around me
go on with their old existence
like props in a play, as if the curtain
has just risen on a room in an Italian villa.
It’s not my play. 
In the old life there was a photo
of Valentino on my desk.
Agnes Ayers was swooning in his arms,
the Sheik in a rapture of lips
without any words. 
Benevolent uncles spoke in a language.
I didn’t know, their fleshy hands,
their anxious eyes smiling
as they patted me gently on the head.
Like watching a silent movie,
when they opened their mouths
like fish under water
I turned off the sound. 
All that sweet absence.

Once I learned the thirteen principles
of Rabbi Salanter, but I remember
only seven: truth, diligence, honor,
repose, cleanliness, frugality,
and silence. If I collected words
they would have to belong,
like moss or fleas. Things you say
that I can believe in. 
Honor reminds me too much of the Samurai.
I like repose. It belongs to this landscape
where even the lizards rest
when we stand still
and look at the wall together. 
Naming the things of this world
you begin to own them.
Cyclamen. Mustard.
I can’t manage so many flowers.
But I already know the word for lake in Italian. 
* 
Gulls wheel over Lago di Como
at sundown on their way south
trying to catch the last warm currents.
Their wings are white, then silver, and then smoke
when the light abandons them
and dusk settles in their feathers. 
If you don’t collect things,
it’s easier to move. Easier to stand
on this cliff for another minute
and watch the leaves fall, one by one,
yellow, into the lake.
They belong to the air
for the time they are drifting.
It’s a long way down.

When the fire bell rang its two short, one long   
electric signal, the boys closest to the wall   
of windows had to raise the blinds and close   
the sashes, and then join the last of our line   
as it snaked out the classroom onto the field   
of asphalt where we stood, grade-by-grade,
until the principal appeared with her gold Timex. 
We learned early that catastrophe must always   
be attended in silence, that death prefers us   
orderly and ordered, and that rules will save us   
from the chaos of our fear, so that even   
if we die, we die together, which was the calm   
almost consoling thought I had each time
the yellow C.D. siren wailed and we would tuck   
ourselves beneath our sturdy desktops. 
Eyes averted from the windows,
we’d wait for the drill to pass or until
the nun’s rosary no longer clicked and we could hear   
her struggling to free herself from the leg-well   
of her desk, and then her call for us to rise   
and, like herself, brush off the dust gathered   
on our clothes. And then the lessons resumed.   
No thought of how easily we interred ourselves, 
though at home each would dream the mushroom cloud,   
the white cap of apocalypse whose funnel stem   
sucked glass from windows, air from lungs,   
and made all these rehearsals the sad and hollow   
gestures that they were, for we knew it in our bones   
that we would die, curled in a last defense—
head on knees, arms locked around legs—
the way I’ve seen it since in nursing homes 
and hospices: forms bedsheets can’t hide,   
as if in death the body takes on the soul’s   
compact shape, acrobatic, posed to tumble free   
of the desktop or bed and join the expanse   
and wide scatter of debris.

We drive between lakes just turning green;   
Late June. The white turkeys have been moved   
A second time to new grass.
How long the seconds are in great pain!   
Terror just before death,
Shoulders torn, shot
From helicopters. “I saw the boy
being tortured with a telephone generator,”   
The sergeant said.
“I felt sorry for him
And blew his head off with a shotgun.”   
These instants become crystals,
Particles
The grass cannot dissolve. Our own gaiety   
Will end up
In Asia, and you will look down in your cup   
And see
Black Starfighters.
Our own cities were the ones we wanted to bomb!   
Therefore we will have to
Go far away
To atone
For the suffering of the stringy-chested   
And the short rice-fed ones, quivering   
In the helicopter like wild animals,
Shot in the chest, taken back to be questioned.

He has five children, I’m papa
to a hundred pencils.
I bought the chair he sat in 
from a book of chairs,
staplers and spikes
that let me play Vlad the Impaler 
with invading memos. When I said I have to lay you off
a parallel universe was born 
in his face, one where flesh
is a loose shirt
taken to the river and beaten 
against rocks. Just
by opening my mouth I destroyed
his faith he’s a man 
who can think honey-glazed ham
and act out the thought
with plastic or bills. We sat. 
I stared at my hands, he stared
at the wall staring at my hands.
I said other things 
about the excellent work he’d done
and the cycles of business
which are like 
the roller-coaster thoughts
of an oscilloscope. All this time
I saw the eyes of his wife 
which had always been brown
like almonds but were now brown
like the crust of bread. We walked 
to the door, I shook his hand,
felt the bones pretending
to be strong. On his way home 
there was a happy song
because de Sade invented radio,
the window was open, he saw 
delphinium but couldn’t remember
the name. I can only guess.
Maybe at each exit 
that could have led his body
to Tempe, to Mars, he was tempted
to forget his basketball team 
of sons, or that he ever liked
helping his wife clean carrots,
the silver sink turning orange. 
Running’s natural to most animals
who aren’t part
of a lecture series on Nature’s 
Dead Ends. When I told him,
I saw he was looking for a place
in his brain to hide 
his brain. I tried that later
with beer, it worked until I stood
at the toilet to make my little 
waterfall, and thought of him
pushing back from a bar
to go make the same noise.

You see, they have no judgment.
So it is natural that they should drown,
first the ice taking them in
and then, all winter, their wool scarves
floating behind them as they sink
until at last they are quiet.
And the pond lifts them in its manifold dark arms. 
But death must come to them differently,
so close to the beginning.
As though they had always been
blind and weightless. Therefore
the rest is dreamed, the lamp,
the good white cloth that covered the table,
their bodies. 
And yet they hear the names they used
like lures slipping over the pond: What are you waiting for
come home, come home, lost
in the waters, blue and permanent

They’d been warned
on every farm
that playing
in the silos
would lead to death.
You sink in wheat.
Slowly. And the more
you struggle the worse it gets.
‘You’ll see a rat sail past
your face, nimble on its turf,
and then you’ll disappear.’
In there, hard work
has no reward.
So it became a kind of test
to see how far they could sink
without needing a rope
to help them out.
But in the midst of play
rituals miss a beat—like both
leaping in to resolve
an argument
as to who’d go first
and forgetting
to attach the rope.
Up to the waist
and afraid to move.
That even a call for help
would see the wheat
trickle down.
The painful consolidation
of time. The grains
in the hourglass
grotesquely swollen.
And that acrid
chemical smell
of treated wheat
coaxing them into
a near-dead sleep.

The function, as it seems to me,   
O’ Poetry is to bring to be   
At lang, lang last that unity ...    
But wae’s me on the weary wheel!   
Higgledy-piggledy in’t we reel,   
And little it cares hoo we may feel. 
Twenty-six thoosand years ’t’ll tak’   
For it to threid the Zodiac
—A single roond o’ the wheel to mak’! 
Lately it turned—I saw mysel’
In sic a company doomed to mell,   
I micht ha’e been in Dante’s Hell. 
It shows hoo little the best o’ men   
E’en o’ themsels at times can ken—
I sune saw that when I gaed ben. 
The lesser wheel within the big   
That moves as merry as a grig,   
Wi’ mankind in its whirligig, 
And hasna turned a’e circle yet   
Tho’ as it turns we slide in it,
And needs maun tak’ the place we get. 
I felt it turn, and syne I saw
John Knox and Clavers in my raw,   
And Mary Queen o’ Scots ana’, 
And Rabbie Burns and Weelum Wallace,   
And Carlyle lookin’ unco gallus,   
And Harry Lauder (to enthrall us). 
And as I looked I saw them a’,   
A’ the Scots baith big and sma’,   
That e’er the braith o’ life did draw. 
‘Mercy o’ Gode, I canna thole   
Wi’ sic an orra mob to roll.’ —‘Wheesht! It’s for the guid o’ your soul.’ 
‘But what’s the meanin’, what’s the sense?’   
   —‘Men shift but by experience. ’Twixt Scots there is nae difference. 
They canna learn, sae canna move,   
But stick for aye to their auld groove
—The only race in History who’ve

Frae stert to present o’ their story,   
And deem their ignorance their glory. 
The mair they differ, mair the same.   
The wheel can whummle a’ but them,
—They ca’ their obstinacy “Hame,” 
And “Puir Auld Scotland” bleat wi’ pride,   
And wi’ their minds made up to bide   
A thorn in a’ the wide world’s side. 
There ha’e been Scots wha ha’e ha’en thochts,

When Learning’s triumph o’er her barb’rous foes First rear’d the stage, immortal Shakespear rose; Each change of many-colour’d life he drew, Exhausted worlds, and then imagin’d new: Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign, And panting Time toil’d after him in vain: His pow’rful strokes presiding Truth impress’d, And unresisted Passion storm’d the breast.           Then Jonson came, instructed from the school, To please in method, and invent by rule; His studious patience, and laborious art, By regular approach essay’d the heart; Cold Approbation gave the ling’ring bays, For those who durst not censure, scarce could praise. A mortal born he met the general doom, But left, like Egypt’s kings, a lasting tomb.           The Wits of Charles found easier ways to fame, Nor wish’d for Jonson’s art, or Shakespear’s flame, Themselves they studied, as they felt, they writ, Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit. Vice always found a sympathetic friend; They pleas’d their age, and did not aim to mend. Yet bards like these aspir’d to lasting praise, And proudly hop’d to pimp in future days. Their cause was gen’ral, their supports were strong, Their slaves were willing, and their reign was long; Till Shame regain’d the post that Sense betray’d, And Virtue call’d Oblivion to her aid.           Then crush’d by rules, and weaken’d as refin’d, For years the pow’r of tragedy declin’d; From bard, to bard, the frigid caution crept, Till Declamation roar’d, while Passion slept. Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread, Philosophy remain’d, though Nature fled. But forc’d at length her ancient reign to quit, She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of wit: Exulting Folly hail’d the joyful day, And pantomime, and song, confirm’d her sway.           But who the coming changes can presage, And mark the future periods of the stage?— Perhaps if skill could distant times explore, New Behns, new Durfoys, yet remain in store. Perhaps, where Lear has rav’d, and Hamlet died, On flying cars new sorcerers may ride. Perhaps, for who can guess th’ effects of chance? Here Hunt may box, or Mahomet may dance.           Hard is his lot, that here by Fortune plac’d, Must watch the wild vicissitudes of taste; With ev’ry meteor of caprice must play, And chase the new-blown bubbles of the day. Ah! let not censure term our fate our choice, The stage but echoes back the public voice. The drama’s laws the drama’s patrons give, For we that live to please, must please to live.           Then prompt no more the follies you decry, As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die; ’Tis yours this night to bid the reign commence Of rescu’d Nature, and reviving Sense; To chase the charms of Sound, the pomp of Show, For useful Mirth, and salutary Woe; Bid scenic Virtue form the rising age, And Truth diffuse her radiance from the stage.

When in his twenties a poetry's full strength
Burst into voice as an unstopping flood,
He let the divine prompting (come at length)
Rushingly bear him any way it would
And went on writing while the Ferry turned
From San Francisco, back from Berkeley too,
And back again, and back again. He learned
You add to, you don't cancel what you do. 
Between the notebook-margins his pen travelled,
His own lines carrying him in a new mode
To ports in which past purposes unravelled.
So that, as on the Ferry Line he rode,
Whatever his first plans that night had been,
The energy that rose from their confusion
Became the changing passage lived within
While the pen wrote, and looked beyond conclusion.

Forty years later, and both kidneys gone;
Every eight hours, home dialysis;
The habit of his restlessness stayed on
Exhausting him with his responsiveness.
After the circulations of one day
In which he taught a three-hour seminar
Then gave a reading clear across the Bay,
And while returning from it to the car 
With plunging hovering tread tired and unsteady
Down Wheeler steps, he faltered and he fell
—Fell he said later, as if I stood ready,
"Into the strong arms of Thom Gunn."
                                                      Well well,
The image comic, as I might have known,
And generous, but it turned things round to myth:
He fell across the white steps there alone,
Though it was me indeed that he was with. 
I hadn't caught him, hadn't seen in time,
And picked him up where he had softly dropped,
A pillow full of feathers. Was it a rime
He later sought, in which he might adopt
The role of H.D., broken-hipped and old,
Who, as she moved off from the reading-stand,
Had stumbled on the platform but was held
And steadied by another poet's hand? 
He was now a posthumous poet, I have said
(For since his illness he had not composed),
In sight of a conclusion, whose great dread
Was closure,
                  his life soon to be enclosed
Like the sparrow's flight above the feasting friends,
Briefly revealed where its breast caught their light,
Beneath the long roof, between open ends,
Themselves the margins of unchanging night.

Nor less the Fleet that warred for Right,       And, warring so, prevailed, In geometric beauty curved,       And in an orbit sailed.

Every day a wilderness—no  shade in sight. Beulah patient among knicknacks,  the solarium a rage of light, a grainstorm as her gray cloth brings dark wood to life.  Under her hand scrolls and crests gleam darker still. What was his name, that silly boy at the fair with the rifle booth? And his kiss and  the clear bowl with one bright  fish, rippling wound!  Not Michael— something finer. Each dust  stroke a deep breath and  the canary in bloom. Wavery memory: home  from a dance, the front door  blown open and the parlor  in snow, she rushed the bowl to the stove, watched  as the locket of ice dissolved and he swam free.  That was years before Father gave her up with her name, years before  her name grew to mean  Promise, then  Desert-in-Peace. Long before the shadow and  sun’s accomplice, the tree.  Maurice.

Lie down—lie down!—my noble hound,          That joyful bark give o’er; It wakes the lonely echoes round,          But rouses me no more— Thy lifted ears, thy swelling chest,          Thy eyes so keenly bright, No longer kindle in my breast          The thrill of fierce delight; When following thee on foaming steed My eager soul outstripped thy speed—  Lie down—lie down—my faithful hound!          And watch this night by me, For thee again the horn shall sound          By mountain, stream, and tree; And thou along the forest glade,          Shall track the flying deer When cold and silent, I am laid          In chill oblivion here. Another voice shall cheer thee on, And glory when the chase is won.  Lie down—lie down!—my gallant hound!          Thy master’s life is sped; Go—couch thee on the dewy ground—          ’Tis thine to watch the dead. But when the blush of early day          Is kindling up the sky, Then speed thee, faithful friend, away,          And to thy mistress hie; And guide her to this lonely spot, Though my closed eyes behold her not—  Lie down—lie down!—my trusty hound!          Death comes, and we must part— In my dull ear strange murmurs sound—          More faintly throbs my heart; The many twinkling lights of heaven          Scarce glimmer in the blue— Chill round me falls the breath of even,          Cold on my brow the dew; Earth, stars, and heavens, are lost to sight— The chase is o’er!—brave friend, good night!—

I strove with none, for none was worth my strife:

Imagining, on a long walk   
between two Greek towns,
those Turkish prisoners the guidebook   
says were sabred where they crowded   
together on the stone dock;   
and then imagining—still walking,   
anxious to see some worker   
in the fields or another old couple   
like the last one (he riding   
the donkey, she leading it in black)—
the Greeks whom the Germans shot;   
and as the road after rising   
leads down again, at last to   
the town by the bay, imagining   
all the feuds given license   
by the civil war, the woman   
whose husband, forgive him   
his faults now, steps
dead through the doorway one night:   
imagining, imagining—is there   
a way out of this brooding ahead   
to the hollow thud of the first   
dirt thrown down on his coffin? 
What is the word any tongue   
can make good for the boy—
let someone else name his country—
who speaks to his sleeping wife
when he leaves at night,
his brother tagging after him,
one puny gun between them?
If his cold spirit can still
speak her name tomorrow, won’t she feel   
even more alone?
                        Aeneas carried
a high purpose on the point of his sword:   
a city needed founding, if not
here then in another place.
This road, though, dips past
two ordinary houses and then the disco   
casting a stale abandoned shade,   
sharp-edged, to one side, and I descend—
through hot odd-angled streets lined   
with those plane trees whose name’s   
so bland and awkward translated
out of sunny Greek or Spanish—
to the huge white plane-tree-shaded square. 
At the cafe in the open air
I order lemonade from the waitress   
who has just served the little table   
crowded round by seven or eight,
a changing group—the eager interpreter   
talking and listening at the same time,   
three young women
dressed up, and even in this small town
the four military men from the foreign   
ship offshore, out of uniform but   
with an apparent eye for swag   
some future day, talking of
small deals, clever braveries, travels.   
They exact smiles and attentions   
and never have they seen such   
a pretty town as this, never. 
The three women listen hard
to the roared harsh sounds of the odd tongue,   
then impatiently to the interpreter
while the military men wait.
What could such noise be about?
Do these men love the ways ours do,
do they like their women
to speak to them in bed, to say
what they want, to say it? 
The Turkish prisoners had been led outside   
with the lie that they’d be freed. 
Inside the smoky small bar so
they can watch without being watched,   
young men are bitter, imagining
the weight of medals, coming
one by one to the dusty window-glass
then returning toward the far unlit interior.   
The lemonade arrives at last
in the pretty hands of the waitress,
she puts it on my white table
under the plane trees and hurries away   
to be near the laughing group,
foreign men who one day may bring   
something new to the town, or something old.

To pray you open your whole self
To sky, to earth, to sun, to moon
To one whole voice that is you.
And know there is more
That you can’t see, can’t hear;
Can’t know except in moments
Steadily growing, and in languages
That aren’t always sound but other
Circles of motion.
Like eagle that Sunday morning
Over Salt River. Circled in blue sky
In wind, swept our hearts clean
With sacred wings.
We see you, see ourselves and know
That we must take the utmost care
And kindness in all things.
Breathe in, knowing we are made of
All this, and breathe, knowing
We are truly blessed because we
Were born, and die soon within a
True circle of motion,
Like eagle rounding out the morning
Inside us.
We pray that it will be done
In beauty.
In beauty.

Spiked sun. The Hudson’s
Whittled down by ice.
I hear the bone dice
Of blown gravel clicking. Bone-

Fastens like fur to the river.
Standstill. We were leaving to deliver
Christmas presents when the tire blew
Last year. Above the dead valves pines pared
Down by a storm stood, limbs bared . . .
I want you.

Is this what I was made for? Is the world that fits
Like what I feel when I wake up each morning? Steamclouds   
Hovering over the lake, and smoke ascending from ten thousand chimneys
As in a picture on a calendar, in a frieze of ordinary days?   
Beneath a sky of oatmeal gray, the land slides downwards from a Kmart parking lot
Into a distance lined with bungalows, and then a vague horizon.   
Higher and higher, until its gaze becomes a part of what it sees,   
The mind ascends through layers of immobility into an unfamiliar atmosphere
Where nothing lives, and with a sense of finally breaking free   
Attains its kingdom: a constructed space, or an imaginary city   
Bordered all around by darkness; or a city gradually sinking into age,   
Dominated by a television tower whose blue light warns the traveler away. 
People change, or drift away, or die. It used to be a country   
Bounded by possibility, from which the restless could embark
And then come home to, and where the soul could find an emblem of itself.
Some days I feel a momentary lightness, but then the density returns,   
The salt-encrusted cars drive by the factory where a clock tower   
Overlooks the highway, and the third shift ends. And then softly,   
The way the future used to sing to me when I was ten years old,   
I start to hear the murmur of a voice that isn’t mine at all,   
Formless and indistinct, the music of a world that holds no place for me;
And then an image starts to gather in my mind—a picture of a room
Where someone lingers at a window, staring at a nearly empty street   
Bordered by freight yards and abandoned tanneries. And then the bus stops
And a man gets off, and stands still, and then walks away. 
Last night I had a dream in which the image of a long-forgotten love   
Hovered over the city. No one could remember what his name was   
Or where he came from, or decipher what that emptiness might mean;
Yet on the corner, next to the USA Today machine, a woman seemed to wave at me,
Until the stream of morning traffic blocked her from my view.   
It’s strange, the way a person’s life can feel so far away,
Although the claims of its existence are encountered everywhere   
—In a drugstore, or on the cover of a tabloid, on the local news
Or in the mail that came this morning, in the musings of some talk show host
Whose face is an enigma and whose name is just a number in the phone book,
But whose words are as pervasive as the atmosphere I breathe.   
Why can’t I find my name in this profusion? Nothing even stays,
No image glances back at me, no inner angel hurls itself in rage   
Against the confines of this surface that confronts me everywhere I look
—At home or far away, here or on the way back from the store—
Behind an all-inclusive voice and personality, fashioned out of fear   
And scattered like a million isolated points transmitting random images
Across a space alive with unconnected signals. 
                                                          I heard my name
Once, but then the noise of waiting patiently resumed. It felt the same,
Yet gradually the terms I used to measure out my life increased,   
Until I realized that I’d been driving down these streets for sixteen years.
I was part of the surroundings: people looked at me the way I used to look at them,
And most of what I felt seemed second nature. Now and then that sense I’d had in high school
—Of a puzzlement about to lift, a language just about to start—
Meandered into consciousness; but by and large I’d spend the days   
Like something in the background, or like part of a design too intricate to see.
Wasn’t there supposed to be a stage at which the soul at last broke free
And started to meet the world on equal terms? To feel a little more at home,
More intensely realized, more successfully contained
Within the arc of its achievements? Filled with reservations,   
Moods and private doubts, yet always moving, with increasing confidence,
Towards a kind of summary, towards the apex of a long career   
Advancing down an avenue that opened on a space of sympathy and public understanding?
Or howling like the wind in the wires outside my window, in a cacophony of rage?
I don’t think so. Age is like the dreams one had in childhood,   
Some parts of which were true—I have the things I want, the words to misdescribe them,
And the freedom to imagine what I think I feel. I think that most of what I feel remains unknown,
But that beneath my life lies something intricate and real and   
Nearly close enough to touch. I live it, and I know I should explain it,
Only I know I can’t—it’s just an image of my life that came to me one day,
And which remained long after the delight it brought had ended.   
Sometimes I think I hear the sound of death approaching
Like a song in the trees, a performance staged for me and me alone   
And written in the ersatz language of loss, the language of time passing,
Or the sound of someone speaking decorously into the unknown   
—Like a voice picked up on the telephone when two lines cross momentarily
—Overheard, and then half heard, and then gone.

Lear's five nevers over
the fool hanged, and Cordelia
and Lear dead at last, Edmund
reported and yes he was loved
by both evil sisters, so what.
I'm awake in the dawn. Cold
stone floors. The cat. His
father loved him too, I tell
my son on the phone, my

cleave to his wife. Let my
old flesh resume its boundaries,
let go. No divisions of the kingdom.
Will they write of my courage
killing the snake? We know
the dreamy answer to that one.
Honey tea swirls us sweet;

Tea bags bottomless coffee
cup. Ashes in the grate sweeten
the garden provender. Clay.
Ripeness is all. The fool lives on,

you turn onto McAllister,
seems to dwell there, disembodied,
on a shelf above the sidewalk. 
The mad old lady with lizard skin   
bent double
                over her shopping cart   
and trailing a cloud of pigeons   
is nowhere in sight. 
A pile of rags here and there
but no one underneath.
                                 An invisible shrine   
commemorating what?
Old mattresses and dusty flesh, 
piss and puked-on overcoats, what?
                            Maybe death,
now there’s a smell that likes to stick around.   
You used to find it in downtown Sally Anns   
and once 
in a hospital cafeteria, only faintly,   
after a bite of poundcake.
                                       But here it lives,
cheek by jowl with McDonald’s,   
still robust after a night of wind 
with its own dark little howdy-do
for the drunks and cops,
social workers and whores,
or the elderly couple from Zurich   
leafing cooly through their guidebook.

Even on Easter Sunday   
when the church was a 
jungle of lilies and   
ferns fat Uncle Paul 
who loved his liquor   
so would pound away 
with both fists on the   
stone pulpit shouting 
sin sin sin and the   
fiery fires of hell 
and I cried all after-
noon the first time I 
heard what they did to   
Jesus it was something 
the children shouldn’t   
know about till they 
were older but the new   
maid told me and both 
of us cried a lot and so   
mother got another one 
right away & she sent   
away Miss Richardson 
who came all the way   
from England because 
she kept telling how   
her fiancé Mr. Bowles- 
Lyon died suddenly of   
a heart attack he just 
said one day at lunch   
I’m afraid I’m not well 
and the next thing they   
knew he was sliding un- 
der the table. Easter   
was nice the eggs were 
silly but the big lilies   
were wonderful & when 
Uncle Paul got so fat   
from drinking that he 
couldn’t squeeze into   
the pulpit anymore & 
had to preach from the   
floor there was an el- 
ders’ meeting and they   
said they would have 
the pulpit rebuilt but   
Uncle Paul said no it 
was the Lord’s manifest   
will and he would pass 
his remaining years in   
sacred studies I liked 
Thanksgiving better be-
cause that was the day 
father took us down to   
the mills but Easter I 
liked next best and the   
rabbits died because we 
fed them beet tops and   
the lamb pulled up the 
grass by the roots and   
was sold to Mr. Page the 
butcher I asked Uncle   
Robert what were sacred 
studies he said he was   
not really sure but he 
guessed they came in a   
bottle and mother sent 
me away from the table   
when I wouldn’t eat my 
lamb chops that was   
ridiculous she said it 
wasn’t the lamb of God   
it was just Caesar An- 
dromache Nibbles but I   
couldn’t I just couldn’t 
& the year of the strike   
we didn’t go to Church 
at all on Easter because   
they said it wasn’t safe 
down town so instead we   
had prayers in the library 
and then right in the mid-
dle the telephone rang it 
was Mr. Shupstead at the   
mill they had had to use 
tear gas father made a   
special prayer right a- 
way for God’s protection   
& mercy and then he sent 
us out to the farm with   
mother we stayed a week 
and missed school but it   
rained a lot and I broke 
the bathroom mirror and   
had to learn a long psalm.

Come to me in the silence of the night;
   Come in the speaking silence of a dream;
Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright
   As sunlight on a stream;
      Come back in tears,
O memory, hope, love of finished years. 
Oh dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet,
   Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,
Where souls brimfull of love abide and meet;
   Where thirsting longing eyes
      Watch the slow door
That opening, letting in, lets out no more. 
Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live
   My very life again tho’ cold in death:
Come back to me in dreams, that I may give
   Pulse for pulse, breath for breath:
      Speak low, lean low,
As long ago, my love, how long ago.

How much shall I love her?For life, or not long?
          “Not long.”
Alas! When forget her?In years, or by June?
          “By June.”
And whom woo I after?No one, or a throng?
          “A throng.”
Of these shall I wed oneLong hence, or quite soon?
          “Quite soon.”
And which will my bride be?The right or the wrong?
          “The wrong.”
And my remedy – what kind?Wealth-wove, or earth-hewn?
          “Earth-hewn.”

A learned and a happy ignorance           Divided me       From all the vanity, From all the sloth, care, pain, and sorrow that advance       The madness and the misery Of men. No error, no distraction I Saw soil the earth, or overcloud the sky.     I knew not that there was a serpent’s sting,           Whose poison shed       On men, did overspread The world; nor did I dream of such a thing       As sin, in which mankind lay dead. They all were brisk and living wights to me, Yea, pure and full of immortality.     Joy, pleasure, beauty, kindness, glory, love,           Sleep, day, life, light,       Peace, melody, my sight, My ears and heart did fill and freely move.       All that I saw did me delight. The Universe was then a world of treasure, To me an universal world of pleasure.     Unwelcome penitence was then unknown,           Vain costly toys,       Swearing and roaring boys, Shops, markets, taverns, coaches, were unshown;       So all things were that drown’d my joys: No thorns chok’d up my path, nor hid the face Of bliss and beauty, nor eclips’d the place.     Only what Adam in his first estate,           Did I behold;       Hard silver and dry gold As yet lay under ground; my blessed fate       Was more acquainted with the old And innocent delights which he did see In his original simplicity.     Those things which first his Eden did adorn,           My infancy       Did crown. Simplicity Was my protection when I first was born.       Mine eyes those treasures first did see Which God first made. The first effects of love My first enjoyments upon earth did prove;     And were so great, and so divine, so pure;           So fair and sweet,       So true; when I did meet Them here at first, they did my soul allure,       And drew away my infant feet Quite from the works of men; that I might see The glorious wonders of the Deity.

In ’29 before the dust storms
sandblasted Indianapolis,
we believed in the milk company.
Milk came in glass bottles.
We spread dye-colored butter,
now connected to cancer.
We worked seven to seven
with no overtime pay;
pledged allegiance every day,
pitied the starving Armenians.
One morning in the midst of plenty,
there were folks out of context,
who were living on nothing.
Some slept in shacks
on the banks of the river.
This phenomenon investors said
would pass away.
My father worked for the daily paper.
He was a union printer;
lead slugs and blue smoke.
He worked with hot lead
at a two-ton machine,
in a low-slung seat;
a green-billed cap
pulled low on his forehead.
He gave my mother a dollar a day.
You could say we were rich.
This was the Jazz Age.
All over the country
the dispossessed wandered
with their hungry children,
harassed by the law.
When the market broke, bad losers
jumped out of windows.
It was time to lay an elegant table,
as it is now; corporate paradise;
the apple before the rot caved in.
It was the same worm
eating the same fruit.
In fact, the same Eden.

The woman is perfected.   
Her dead 
Body wears the smile of accomplishment,   
The illusion of a Greek necessity 
Flows in the scrolls of her toga,   
Her bare 
Feet seem to be saying:
We have come so far, it is over. 
Each dead child coiled, a white serpent,   
One at each little 
Pitcher of milk, now empty.   
She has folded 
Them back into her body as petals   
Of a rose close when the garden 
Stiffens and odors bleed
From the sweet, deep throats of the night flower. 
The moon has nothing to be sad about,   
Staring from her hood of bone. 
She is used to this sort of thing.
Her blacks crackle and drag.

Father’s opinion of savages
And dogs, a gay Bloomsbury epigram:
‘The brutes may possibly have souls,’ he says,
‘But reason, no. Nevertheless, I am
Prepared not to extend this to my spouse
And children.’ This demands a careful pity:
Poor Father! Whooping and romping in their house,
A holiday from ruin in the City.
His wit falls flat, his tie just will not tie.
The dog’s in chains, the reasonable books
Grazed by his children as they learn to fly.
He takes his dear wife’s arm (his hands grow hooks).
Pirates and pudding! Come, such cruelty! 
His beard is branching like a burning tree.

Popped from the womb, he began gathering property
extorted from his wet nurses by threatening 
to turn blue in the face and die. Everyone gave in.
His mother dressed him in guava-colored lace crinolines 
his father obligingly retired to the Côte d’Azur
siblings were disposed of by the Beast of the Bassinet. 
Coextensive with the world, his hands become The Hands,
his mouth The Mouth, his dingus The Dingus.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely said Lord Acton.
Absolute corruption set in: a foot revolted 
and proclaimed democracy and universal male suffrage
the hairs of his armpit began drinking heavily 
and all over his body an asexual budding
produced nodes of himself, his genetic encumberment 
replicated and replicated, an oblique hysteria.
The absolute corruption of self is community. 
The absolute corruption of the mouth
is to taste its tongue over and over, to be continually filled.

The t(rain)
again this morning, sky always gray,
grain cars f(lying)
like blackbirds with fieldseed
in their bellies. 
The eight o five carrying
g(rain)
sings like tribes
when they migrated north in summer
across the plains
following tracks of herds. 
High water into trees.
The lake full of rain.
We say it is someone else
pushing down on the lake
to make it spill over its edge. 
While we wait
the woman earth sings with the tribes,
transforms herself
into all things. 
After the train
b(rush) burning, the delay of smoke
in the car comes after
we have passed like sound. 
Rain hangs fringe from earth woman’s dress.
She holds the delay of truth
until it comes from our mouths. 
Coyotes sleep on her lap,
birds fly into the b(ranches) of her hair
while farther down the road
the black snake train wiggles behind her ear.

1.
         Prurient tapirs gamboled on our lawns,
         But that was quite some time ago.
         Now one is accosted by asthmatic bulldogs,
         Sluggish in the hedges, ruminant. 
         Moving through ivy in the park
         Near drying waterfalls, we open every gate;
         But that grave, shell-white unicorn is gone.
         The path is strewn with papers to the street. 
         Numbers that once were various
         Regarded us, were thought significant, significant
         Enough to bring reporters to the scene.
         But now the bell strikes one, strikes one, 
         Strikes one—monotonous and tired. 
         Or clicks like a sad valise. 
    2. Note to Be Left on the Table
    This ghost of yours, padding about the upper halls,
    Given to fright-wigs Burbage might have worn,
    Moaning in doorways, jumping out at maids,
    Has not convinced me even yet. Can this be you?
    Your life was frightening enough, but this
    Poor pallid counterpart who fuddles in its role
    Is inexcusable. Go haunt the houses of the girls
    You once infected, or the men who bore
    Your company far oftener than I; annoy the others
    For a change. Is this, my house, the medieval hell
    You took to at the grave’s edge, years ago,
    After a dozen other hells had burned themselves away,
    Or are we purgatory here? If not,
    You make it one. I give you until noon.  3.
Ruined travelers in sad trousseaux
Roost on my doorstep, indolent and worn.
Not one of them fulfills despised Rousseau’s
Predictions. Perhaps they are waiting to be born.
If so, the spot’s been badly chosen.
This is a site for posthumous investigations,
Pillows stuffed with nettles, charnal notions:
Apoplectic executioners, bungled incisions.
Indeed, our solitary midwife fondles the hemlock. 
We welcomed one poor hackneyed Christ,
Sad bastard, croaking of pestilence. The basement
Holds him now. He has not as yet arisen.
The tickets are ready; the line forms on the right.
Justice and virtue, you will find, have been amazingly preserved. 
         4.
         As water from a dwindling reservoir
         Uncovers mossy stones, new banks of silt,
         So every minute that I spend with you reveals
         New flaws, new features, new intangibles.
         We have been sitting here for hours—
         “I spent that summer in Madrid,
         The winter on the coast of France—
         The Millotsons were there, and Farnsworth.
         My work has perished with the rest
         Of Europe, gone, all gone. We will not see the end.” 
         You said goodbye, and your perfume
         Lingered for hours. At first it seemed
         Like summer dying there, then rank and sharp. 
         And yet I did not air the room. 
      5.
      Among Victorian beadwork and the smell of plush,
      The owls, stuffed and marvelously sinister,
      Glare from dark corners, waiting for the night.
      High up, the moose’s passive eyes explore
      Candles, unlit, within cut-glass. A door
      Is opened, and you enter with a look
      You might have saved for Pliny or the Pope. 
      The furniture has shrunk now thirty years
      Have passed (with talent thinning out, and words
      Gone dead), and mouths of friends in photographs
      Display their hopeful and outmoded smiles.
      You counted on at least a sputter of nostalgia,
      However fretful. That was a mistake. Even the moose
      Regards you with a tired, uncomprehending stare. 
         6.
         Signboards commemorate their resting place.
         The graveless of another century
         Came and were conquered; now their bones
         Are dust where idiot highways run.
         Land in their eyes, unquiet ancestors
         (On fences yellow signs clang in the wind)
         Unstirred by suns drying the brown weeds
         Above them now in parched and caking land. 
         But when they speak of you, they feel the need
         Of voices polished and revised by history,
         The martial note, words framed in capitals. 
         It is good to be deaf in a deafening time
         With the sky gone colorless, while the dead
         Thunder breaks, a cracked dish, out of the mind. 
      7.
      The eye no longer single: where the bowl,
      Dead in the thickened darkness, swelled with light,
      Transformed the images and moved the artist’s hand,
      Becomes a framework for our mania. 
      And haunts the stairway. Friends depart,
      Taking their last look from the roof,
      Saying goodnight and carrying their view
      Of grapes the model ate in Paris years ago. 
      Blue in the morning, green some afternoons;
      The night, ambiguous, forgets the signature. 
      The dust in attics settled and his stove
      Grew cold. About the model nothing much is known. 
      It ends the wall and complements the view
      Of chimneys. And it hides a stain. 
         8.
         And when your beauty, washed away
         In impure streams with my desire,
         Is only topic for ill-mannered minds,
         Gifted and glassy with exact recall,
         Gossip and rancid footnotes, or remote despair,
         Let ruined weather perish in the streets
         And let the world’s black lying flag come down. 
         Only in calendars that mark no Spring
         Can there be weather in the mind
         That moves to you again as you are now:
         Tired after love and silent in this house,
         Your back turned to me, quite alone,
         Standing with one hand raised to smooth your hair,
         At a small window, green with rain.

If, in an odd angle of the hutment,
A puppy laps the water from a can
Of flowers, and the drunk sergeant shaving   
Whistles O Paradiso!—shall I say that man   
Is not as men have said: a wolf to man? 
The other murderers troop in yawning;   
Three of them play Pitch, one sleeps, and one   
Lies counting missions, lies there sweating   
Till even his heart beats: One; One; One. O murderers! ... Still, this is how it’s done: 
This is a war.... But since these play, before they die,   
Like puppies with their puppy; since, a man,
I did as these have done, but did not die—
I will content the people as I can
And give up these to them: Behold the man! 
I have suffered, in a dream, because of him,   
Many things; for this last saviour, man,
I have lied as I lie now. But what is lying?
Men wash their hands, in blood, as best they can:   
I find no fault in this just man.

Either she was foul, or her attire was bad,Or she was not the wench I wished t’have had.Idly I lay with her, as if I loved not,And like a burden grieved the bed that moved not.Yet though both of us performed our true intent,Yet I could not cast anchor where I meant.She on my neck her ivory arms did throw,Her arms far whiter than the Scythian snow.And eagerly she kissed me with her tongue,And under mine her wanton thigh she flung.Yea, and she soothed me up and called me sir,And used all speech that might provoke and stir.Yet, like as if cold hemlock I had drunk,It mockèd me, hung down the head, and sunk.Like a dull cipher or rude block I lay,Or shade or body was I, who can say?What will my age do, age I cannot shun,When in my prime my force is spent and done?I blush, that being youthful, hot and lusty,I prove neither youth nor man, but old and rusty.Pure rose she, like a nun to sacrifice,Or one that with her tender brother lies.Yet boarded I the golden Chie twice,And Libas, and the white-cheeked Pitho thrice.Corinna craved it in a summer’s night,And nine sweet bouts we had before daylight.What, waste my limbs through some Thessalian charms?May spells and drugs do silly souls such harm?With virgin wax hath some imbaste my jointsAnd pierced my liver with sharp needles’ points?Charms change corn to grass and make it die.By charms are running spring and fountains dry.By charms mast crops from oaks, from vines grapes fall,And fruit from trees when there’s no wind at all.Why might not then my sinews be enchanted,And I grow faint, as with some spirit haunted?To this add shame: shame to perform it quailed meAnd was the second cause why vigour failed me.My idle thoughts delighted her no moreThan did the robe or garment which she wore.Yet might her touch make youthful Pylius fireAnd Tithon livelier than his years require.Even her I had, and she had me in vain;What might I crave more if I asked again?I think the great gods grieved they had bestowedThe benefit which lewdly I for-slowed.I wished to be received in. In I get meTo kiss. I kiss. To lie with her, she let me.Why was I blessed? Why made king to refuse it?Chuff-like had I not gold and could not use it?So in a spring thrives he that told so much, And looks upon the fruits he cannot touch.Hath any rose so from a fresh young maid,As she might straight have gone to church and prayed?Well I believe she kissed not as she should,Nor used the sleight and cunning which she could.Huge oaks, hard adamants might she have moved,And with sweet words cause deaf rocks to have loved.Worthy she was to move both gods and men,But neither was I man, nor lived then.Can deaf ear take delight when Phaemius sings?Or Thamiras in curious painted things?What sweet thought is there but I had the same?And one gave place still as another came.Yet, notwithstanding, like one dead it lay,Drooping more than a rose pulled yesterday.Now, when he should not jet, he bolts uprightAnd craves his task, and seeks to be at fight.Lie down with shame, and see thou stir no more,Seeing thou wouldst deceive me as before.Thou cozenest me, by thee surprised am I, And bide sore loss with endless infamy.Nay more, the wench did not disdain a whitTo take it in her hand and play with it.But when she saw it would by no means stand,But still drooped down, regarding not her hand,‘Why mockst thou me?’ she cried. ‘Or, being ill,Who bade thee lie down here against thy will?Either thou art witch, with blood of frogs new dead,Or jaded camest thou from some other bed.’With that, her loose gown on, from me she cast her –In skipping out her naked feet much graced her.And, lest her maid should know of this disgrace,To cover it, spilt water on the place.

Gaily bedight,    A gallant knight, In sunshine and in shadow,      Had journeyed long,      Singing a song, In search of Eldorado.     But he grew old—    This knight so bold—   And o’er his heart a shadow—      Fell as he found    No spot of ground That looked like Eldorado.

Her handlers, dressed in vests and flannel pants,
   Step forward in the weak winter light   
Leading a behemoth among elephants,   
Topsy, to another exhibition site;
   Caparisoned with leather bridle,   
Six impassive tons of carnival delight   
Shambles on among spectators who sidle
   Nervously off, for the brute has killed   
At least three men, most recently an idle   
Hanger-on at shows, who, given to distilled
   Diversions, fed her a live cigar.
Since become a beast of burden, Topsy thrilled
The crowds in her palmy days, and soon will star   
   Once more, in an electrocution,   
Which incident, though it someday seem bizarre,
Is now a new idea in execution. 
Topsy has been fed an unaccustomed treat,   
   A few carrots laced with cyanide,
And copper plates have been fastened to her feet,   
Wired to cables running off on either side;
   She stamps two times in irritation,
Then waits, for elephants, having a thick hide,   
Know how to be patient. The situation
   Seems dreamlike, till someone throws a switch,   
And the huge body shakes for the duration   
Of five or six unending seconds, in which
   Smoke rises and Topsy’s trunk contracts
And twelve thousand mammoth pounds finally pitch   
To earth, as the current breaks and all relax.
   It is a scene shot with shades of grey—
The smoke, the animal, the reported facts—
On a seasonably grey and gloomy day. 
Would you care to see any of that again?
   See it as many times as you please,   
For an electrician, Thomas Edison,
Has had a bright idea we call the movies,
   And called on for monitory spark,
Has preserved it all in framed transparencies   
That are clear as day, for all the day is dark.
   You might be amused on second glance
To note the background—it’s an amusement park!—
A site on Coney Island where elephants
   Are being used in the construction,
And where Topsy, through a keeper’s negligence,   
Got loose, causing some property destruction,
   And so is shown to posterity,
A study in images and conduction,

after Ovid



In summer’s heat and mid-time of the dayTo rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,One window shut, the other open stood,Which gave such light as twinkles in a wood,Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sunOr night being past, and yet not day begun.Such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown,Where they may sport, and seem to be unknown.Then came Corinna in a long loose gown,Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:Resembling fair Semiramis going to bedOr Laïs of a thousand wooers sped.I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,Yet strived she to be covered therewithal.And striving thus as one that would be cast,Betrayed herself, and yielded at the last.Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,Not one wen in her body could I spy.
What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me?How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,I clinged her naked body, down she fell,Judge you the rest: being tired she bad me kiss,Jove send me more such afternoons as this.

Yield prompt compliance to the maid’s desires;A prompt compliance fans the lover’s fires:Go pleas’d where’er she goes, tho’ long the way,Tho’ the fierce Dog-star dart his sultry ray;Tho’ painted Iris gird the bluish sky,And sure portends, that rattling storms are nigh:Or, if the fair one pant for sylvan fame,Gay drag the meshes, and provoke the game:Nay, should she choose to risk the driving gale;Or steer, or row, or agile hand the sail:No toil, tho’ weak, tho’ fearful, thou forbear;No toils should tire you, and no dangers scare:Occasion smiles, then snatch an ardent kiss;The coy may struggle, but will grant the bliss:The bliss obtain’d, the fictious struggle past,Unbid, they’ll clasp you in their arms at last.

If there is any dwelling place

—Tacitus



Who keeps the owl’s breath? Whose eyes desire?   
Why do the stars rhyme? Where does
The flush cargo sail? Why does the daybook close?  So sleep and do not sleep. 
The opaque stroke lost across the mirror,
The clamp turned.
The polished nails begin the curl into your palms.   
The opal hammock of rain falls out of its cloud. 
I name you, Gloat-of- The-stalks, drowse-my-embers, old-lily-bum.
No matter how well a man sucks praise in the end   
He sucks earth. Go ahead, step
Out into that promised, rasp gratitude of night. 
Seeds and nerves. Seeds  And nerves. I’ll be waiting for you, in some   
Obscure and clarifying light;
I will say, Look, there is a ghost ice on the land. 
If the page of marble bleeds in the yellow grass,   
If the moon-charts glow useless and cold,
If the grains of the lamp outlast you, as they must—   
As the tide of black gloss, the marls, and nectar rise 
I will understand. 
Here are my gifts: smudges of bud, A blame of lime. Everything you remember crowds   
Away. Stubble memory,
The wallpaper peeling its leaves. Fog. Fog
In the attic; this pod of black milk. Anymore, 
Only a road like August approaches. 
Sometimes the drawers of the earth close;   
Sometimes our stories keep on and on. So listen— 
Leave no address. Fold your clothes into a little   
Island. Kiss the hinges goodbye. Sand the fire. Bitch   
About time. Hymn away this reliquary fever. 
How the sun stands crossing itself in the cut glass. 
How the jonquils and bare orchards fill each morning   
In mist. The branches in the distance stiffen,
Again. The city of stars pales.
In my fires the cinders rise like black angels;
The trunks of the olives twist once towards the world.  Once. I will walk out into the day.

Whenever my father was left with nothing to do —
      waiting for someone to 'get ready',
or facing the gap between graduate seminars
      and dull after-suppers in his study
grading papers or writing a review —
      he played the piano. 
I think of him packing his lifespan
      carefully, like a good leather briefcase,
each irritating chore wrapped in floating passages
      for the left hand and right hand
by Chopin or difficult Schumann;
      nothing inside it ever rattled loose. 
Not rationalism, though you could cut your tongue
      on the blade of his reasonable logic.
Only at the piano did he become
      the bowed, reverent, wholly absorbed Romantic.
The theme of his heroic, unfinished piano sonata
      could have been Brahms. 
Boredom, or what he disapproved of as
      'sitting around with your mouth open'
oddly pursued him. He had small stamina.
      Whenever he succumbed to bouts of winter bronchitis,
the house sank a little into its snowed-up garden,
      missing its musical swim-bladder. 
None of this suggests how natural he was.
      For years I thought fathers played the piano
just as dogs barked and babies grew.
      We children ran in and out of the house,
taking for granted that the 'Trout' or E flat Major Impromptu
      would be rippling around us. 
For him, I think, playing was solo flying, a bliss
      of removal, of being alone.
Not happily always; never an escape,
      for he was affectionate, and the household hum
he pretended to find trivial or ridiculous
      daily sustained him. 
When he talked about music, it was never
      of the lachrimae rerum
that trembled from his drawn-out phrasing
      as raindrops phrase themselves along a wire;
no, he defended movable doh or explained the amazing
      physics of the octave. 
We'd come in from school and find him
      cross-legged on the jungle of the floor,
guts from one of his Steinways strewn about him.
      He always got the pieces back in place.
I remember the yellow covers of Schirmer's Editions
      and the bound Peters Editions in the bookcase. 
When he defected to the cello in later years
      Grandmother, in excrucio, mildly exclaimed,
'Wasn't it lovely when Steve liked to play the piano.'
      Now I'm the grandmother listening to Steve at the piano.
Lightly, in strains from Brahms-Haydn variations,
      his audible image returns to my humming ears.

I am writing now in preconceptions 
Those of sex and ropes 
Many frantic cruelties occur to the flesh of the
         
            imagination 
And the imagination does have flesh to destroy 
And the flesh has imagination to sever 
The mouth is just a body filled with imagination 
Can you imagine its contents 
The dripping into a bucket 
And its acts 
The ellipses and chaining apart 
The feather 
The observer  
The imagination, bare, has nothing to confirm it 
There's just the singing of the birds 
The sounds of the natural scream 
A strange example 
The imagination wishes to be embraced by freedom 
It is laid bare in order to be desired 
But the imagination must keep track of the flesh
         
            responding—its increments of awareness—a
         
            slow progression 
It must be beautiful and it can't be free    
                     -for John Zorn, after his “Elegy”

Linoleum and half a dozen eggs
In 1960
            Many towered Ilium
A brand name and a shopping list too 
Memory distinguishes all things from
Only nothing
                   I was born and grew
Rooms stacked up into houses
A few trees (maples) welted in their seasons
Wildly like sea birds in crude oil
                                              What amazes
Me now amazed me always but never
Often eyesight is prophetic instantly 
Seeing broken eggs on the linoleum
In the kitchen 1960
I saw a broken lifetime further
On as I see now my happy sister

Though beauty be the mark of praise,    And yours of whom I sing be such    As not the world can praise too much, Yet ’tis your virtue now I raise.  A virtue, like allay, so gone    Throughout your form, as, though that move    And draw and conquer all men’s love, This sùbjects you to love of one.  Wherein you triumph yet; because    ’Tis of yourself, and that you use    The noblest freedom, not to choose Against or faith or honor’s laws.  But who should less expect from you,    In whom alone Love lives again?    By whom he is restored to men, And kept, and bred, and brought up true.  His falling temples you have reared,    The withered garlands ta’en away;    His altars kept from the decay That envy wished, and nature feared;  And on them burn so chaste a flame,    With so much loyalties’ expense,    As Love, t’ acquit such excellence, Is gone himself into your name.  And you are he; the deity    To whom all lovers are designed    That would their better objects find; Among which faithful troop am I.  Who, as an offspring at your shrine,    Have sung this hymn, and here entreat    One spark of your diviner heat To light upon a love of mine.  Which, if it kindle not, but scant    Appear, and that to shortest view,    Yet give me leave t’ adore in you What I in her am grieved to want.

... mindful of the unhonored dead
—Thomas Gray



Here they stood, whom the Kecoughtan first believed
gods from another world, one pair of longjohns
each, bad-yellow, knotted with lice,   
the godless, bandy-legged runts   
with ear bit off, or eye gouged,
                                     who killed and prayed
over whatever flew, squatted, or swam. 
In huts hacked from mulberry, pine, and swamp cyprus,   
they huddled ripe as hounds.
At cockcrow scratched, shuffled marsh paths,   
took skiffs and ferried to dead-rise scows,   
twenty-footers dutifully designed and of right draft   
for oysters, crabs, and croakers.
                                     They were seaworthy. 
According to diaries hand-scrawled, and terse court records,   
our ancestors: barbarous, habitual, Virginians. 
Some would not sail, came ashore, walked on the land,   
kept faces clenched, lay seed and family,
moved often, and are gone. Of them
this harbor says nothing.
Of the sea’s workmen, not much,
no brass plate of honor, no monument in the square,   
no square, merely the wreckage of a place. 
                                          But they stood—
proud, black and white, surly in mist
at the hovel of the boatwright, arm pointed:
                     Build me one like that yonder! 
Meaning the gray hull I see across a cove,
bottom up, canting, nameless now as the hard,   
long arm, daddy’s or granddaddy’s, that points, but   
known to the one said to crush clams in his palms, thus   
got paid, always, who built the derelicts, and who,   
barring feud, took stick in hand here, made
that grave gouged line of a keel, 
                               then his broad brow 
lifted seaward, in silence, sometimes
summoning a shape in memory, and it hove up, and was   
changed some, they whined, but God knows
all they wanted, all he made for them was
to be a little unlike the drab hulls
of the dead ones, but not too much.
                                              Like that one yonder! 
This was the image he gave them to dream of change,   
tomorrow only a guess, the sea’s story their
life-stink and bow-slam and stillness, and they   
saw how the fair ones grew, quick riddle-riders   
our fathers feared, schools that gave us
a message sewn on chest, Bible, slate,
and this worm-holed future entered 
blindly as I now have entered his place, feeling   
for log-char, back-flung gates of light,   
and the builder.
                         Like that one ...
the lies begin, each inventing why
he should rise up, he should hack out
the joy they dream, his pitch boiled, black   
as mud seaming their legs. 
                                       Suddenly, I see
and take up a cap left as worthless on a stump, its   
stained round fitting my head like water. 
Merely to wait where the builder heaved shards and chips   
and abortive clots to the tide’s tongue-lap
is to feel the unconceived shape pulse
down his arm, into fingers
that took up that stick to let loose
the ingathered wilderness
of dreams: loon, crow, osprey, gull, the man
who cannot believe what he sees, but still sees it. 
                                                An immense shadow   
making over water. 
                      Stick in hand, eyes squint. And 
                      there it is,                                 
                                                                      the wind cradling  
of an Eagle, wing-sails, unfurled, bow-chopping
white water head on, a creature now there, now gone.   
A man, I have to hold my face up, study how   
air heats, builds a rising push until the high
circle of sight skids out everywhere. 
                                                Dreaming change, 
I understand, almost, the problem: is he not harnessed,   
himself, this light flyer, this father
designed to sail like a small god, to screech
down upon pine-huddled, hungry chicks he must   
send off with his lethal, air-buoyed shape?
Nothing in him asks what is
      over the wave-edge
                         where our brothers float and sink,   
lovely shadows, by the millions.
Putting my back to the sea-worn trunk
they have left me, I pull the stick through
the dirt, and remember the long line,
man-weight in it, and dark-buoyed. 
                                           It grows
with freckling light, with the answering of birds   
crying out the only speech we all have
above our unfinished country   
that looms still in the soul,   
that would bear us hence,   
out of the water that beats in,
out of the water that bore us all here.

The vase was made of clay
With spines of straw
For strength. The sunbaked vase
Soaked in a deep blue dye for days. The events in this wilderness,
Portrayed in the round of the vase, 
Depend on shades of indigo against
The masked areas of the clay, a flat pearl color
To detail the big sky and snow... 
This Montana field in winter is not sorrowful:
A bugle skips through notes: 
We view it all somehow from the center of the field
And there are scattered groups of cavalry. Some of these
Men were seasoned by civil war. Their caps are blue.
Their canteens are frozen. The horses shake their heads
Bothered by beads of ice, the needles of ice
Forming at both sides of their great anvil heads. 
The long, blue cloaks of the officers fall over the haunches
Of the horses. The ammunition wagons
Beside the woods are blurred by the snowy weather... 
Beyond the wagons, farther even, into the woods
There is a sloping streambed. This is
The dark side of the vase which is often misunderstood.
From here through the bare trees there’s
A strange sight to be seen at the very middle of the field: 
A valet is holding a bowl of cherries—archetype and rubric,
A general with white hair eats the fruit while introducing its color
Which will flow through the woods in early December. 
An Indian woman came under dark clouds to give birth, unattended
In the deep wash inside the woods. She knew the weather 
Could turn and staked the tips of two rooted spruce trees
To the earth to make a roof.
The deerskin of her robe is in her mouth. Her legs spread,
He feet are tied up in the roof of darkening spruce. No stars
Show through!

Nature’s lay idiot, I taught thee to love, And in that sophistry, oh, thou dost prove Too subtle: Fool, thou didst not understand The mystic language of the eye nor hand: Nor couldst thou judge the difference of the air Of sighs, and say, this lies, this sounds despair: Nor by the’eye’s water call a malady Desperately hot, or changing feverously. I had not taught thee then, the alphabet Of flowers, how they devicefully being set And bound up, might with speechless secrecy Deliver errands mutely, and mutually. Remember since all thy words used to be To every suitor, “I, ’if my friends agree”; Since, household charms, thy husband’s name to teach, Were all the love-tricks, that thy wit could reach; And since, an hour’s discourse could scarce have made One answer in thee, and that ill arrayed  In broken proverbs, and torn sentences. Thou art not by so many duties his, That from the’world’s common having severed thee, Inlaid thee, neither to be seen, nor see, As mine: who have with amorous delicacies Refined thee’into a blissful paradise. Thy graces and good words my creatures be; I planted knowledge and life’s tree in thee, Which oh, shall strangers taste? Must I alas  Frame and enamel plate, and drink in glass? Chafe wax for others’ seals? break a colt’s force And leave him then, being made a ready horse?

1 
Master of beauty, craftsman of the snowflake,
inimitable contriver,
endower of Earth so gorgeous & different from the boring Moon,
thank you for such as it is my gift. 
I have made up a morning prayer to you
containing with precision everything that most matters.
‘According to Thy will’ the thing begins.
It took me off & on two days. It does not aim at eloquence. 
You have come to my rescue again & again
in my impassable, sometimes despairing years.
You have allowed my brilliant friends to destroy themselves
and I am still here, severely damaged, but functioning. 
Unknowable, as I am unknown to my guinea pigs:
how can I ‘love’ you?
I only as far as gratitude & awe
confidently & absolutely go. 
I have no idea whether we live again.
It doesn’t seem likely
from either the scientific or the philosophical point of view
but certainly all things are possible to you, 
and I believe as fixedly in the Resurrection-appearances to Peter & to Paul
as I believe I sit in this blue chair.
Only that may have been a special case
to establish their initiatory faith. 
Whatever your end may be, accept my amazement.
May I stand until death forever at attention
for any your least instruction or enlightenment.
I even feel sure you will assist me again, Master of insight & beauty.  
               2 
Holy, as I suppose I dare to call you
without pretending to know anything about you
but infinite capacity everywhere & always
& in particular certain goodness to me. 
Yours is the crumpling, to my sister-in-law terrifying thunder,
yours the candelabra buds sticky in Spring,
Christ’s mercy,
the gloomy wisdom of godless Freud: 
yours the lost souls in ill-attended wards,
those agonized thro’ the world
It this instant of time, all evil men,
Belsen, Omaha Beach,— 
incomprehensible to man your ways.
May be the Devil after all exists.
‘I don’t try to reconcile anything’ said the poet at eighty,
‘This is a damned strange world.’ 
Man is ruining the pleasant earth & man.
What at last, my Lord, will you allow?
Postpone till after my children's deaths your doom
if it be thy ineffable, inevitable will. 
I say ‘Thy kingdom come’, it means nothing to me.
Hast Thou prepared astonishments for man?
One sudden Coming? Many so believe.
So not, without knowing anything, do I.  
               3 
Sole watchman of the flying stars, guard me
against my flicker of impulse lust: teach me
to see them as sisters & daughters. Sustain
my grand endeavours: husbandship & crafting. 
Forsake me not when my wild hours come;
grant me sleep nightly, grace soften my dreams;
achieve in me patience till the thing be done,
a careful view of my achievement come. 
Make me from time to time the gift of the shoulder.
When all hurt nerves whine shut away the whiskey.
Empty my heart toward Thee.
Let me pace without fear the common path of death. 
Cross am I sometimes with my little daughter:
fill her eyes with tears. Forgive me, Lord.
Unite my various soul,
sole watchman of the wide & single stars.  
               4 
If I say Thy name, art Thou there? It may be so.
Thou art not absent-minded, as I am.
I am so much so I had to give up driving.
You attend, I feel, to the matters of man. 
Across the ages certain blessings swarm,
horrors accumulate, the best men fail:
Socrates, Lincoln, Christ mysterious.
Who can search Thee out? 
except Isaiah & Pascal, who saw.
I dare not ask that vision, though a piece of it
at last in crisis was vouchsafèd me.
I altered then for good, to become yours. 
Caretaker! take care, for we run in straits.
Daily, by night, we walk naked to storm,
some threat of wholesale loss, to ruinous fear.
Gift us with long cloaks & adrenalin. 
Who haunt the avenues of Angkor Wat
recalling all that prayer, that glory dispersed,
haunt me at the corner of Fifth & Hennepin.
Shield & fresh fountain! Manifester! Even mine.  
               5 
Holy, & holy. The damned are said to say
‘We never thought we would come into this place.’
I’m fairly clear, my Friend, there’s no such place
ordained for inappropriate & evil man. 
Surely they fall dull, & forget. We too,
the more or less just, I feel fall asleep
dreamless forever while the worlds hurl out.
Rest may be your ultimate gift. 
Rest or transfiguration! come & come
whenever Thou wilt. My daughter & my son
fend will without me, when my work is done
in Your opinion. 
Strengthen my widow, let her dream on me
thro’ tranquil hours less & down to less.
Abrupt elsewhere her heart, I sharply hope.
I leave her in wise Hands.  
               6 
Under new management, Your Majesty:
Thine. I have solo’d mine since childhood, since
my father’s suicide when I was twelve
blew out my most bright candle faith, and look at me. 
I served at Mass six dawns a week from five,
adoring Father Boniface & you,
memorizing the Latin he explained.
Mostly we worked alone. One or two women. 
Then my poor father frantic. Confusions & afflictions
followed my days. Wives left me.
Bankrupt I closed my doors. You pierced the roof
twice & again. Finally you opened my eyes. 
My double nature fused in that point of time
three weeks ago day before yesterday.
Now, brooding thro’ a history of the early Church,
I identify with everybody, even the heresiarchs.  
               7 
After a Stoic, a Peripatetic, a Pythagorean,
Justin Martyr studied the words of the Saviour,
finding them short, precise, terrible, & full of refreshment.
I am tickled to learn this. 
Let one day desolate Sherry, fair, thin, tall,
at 29 today her life the Sahara Desert,
who has never once enjoyed a significant relation,
so find His lightning words.  
               A Prayer for the Self 
Who am I worthless that You spent such pains
and take may pains again?
I do not understand; but I believe.
Jonquils respond with wit to the teasing breeze. 
Induct me down my secrets. Stiffen this heart
to stand their horrifying cries, O cushion
the first the second shocks, will to a halt
in mid-air there demons who would be at me. 
May fade before, sweet morning on sweet morning,
I wake my dreams, my fan-mail go astray,
and do me little goods I have not thought of,
ingenious & beneficial Father. 
Ease in their passing my beloved friends,
all others too I have cared for in a travelling life,
anyone anywhere indeed. Lift up
sober toward truth a scared self-estimate.  
               9 
Surprise me on some ordinary day
with a blessing gratuitous. Even I’ve done good
beyond their expectations. What count we then
upon Your bounty? 
Interminable: an old theologian
asserts that even to say You exist is misleading.
Uh-huh. I buy that Second-century fellow.
I press his withered glorifying hand. 
You certainly do not as I exist,
impersonating as well the meteorite
& flaring in your sun your waterfall
or blind in caves pallid fishes. 
Bear in mind me, Who have forgotten nothing,
& Who continues. I may not foreknow
& fail much to remember. You sustain
imperial desuetudes, at the kerb a widow.  
               10 
Fearful I peer upon the mountain path
where once Your shadow passed, Limner of the clouds
up their phantastic guesses. I am afraid,
I never until now confessed. 
I fell back in love with you, Father, for two reasons:
You were good to me, & a delicious author,
rational & passionate. Come on me again,
as twice you came to Azarias & Misael. 
President of the brethren, our mild assemblies
inspire, & bother the priest not to be dull;
keep us week-long in order; love my children,
my mother far & ill, far brother, my spouse. 
Oil all my turbulence as at Thy dictation
I sweat out my wayward works.
Father Hopkins said the only true literary critic is Christ.
Let me lie down exhausted, content with that.  
               11 
Germanicus leapt upon the wild lion in Smyrna,
wishing to pass quickly from a lawless life.
The crowd shook the stadium.
The proconsul marvelled. 
‘Eighty & six years have I been his servant,
and he has done me no harm.
How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?’
Polycarp, John’s pupil, facing the fire. 
Make too me acceptable at the end of time
in my degree, which then Thou wilt award.
Cancer, senility, mania,
I pray I may be ready with my witness.

The bears are kept by hundreds within fences, are fed cracked
Eggs; the weakest are
Slaughtered and fed to the others after being scented
With the blood of deer brought to the pastures by Elizabeth’s
Men—the blood spills from deep pails with bottoms of slate. 
The balding Queen had bear gardens in London and in the country.
The bear is baited: the nostrils
Are blown full with pepper, the Irish wolf dogs
Are starved, then, emptied, made crazy with fermented barley: 
And the bear’s hind leg is chained to a stake, the bear
Is blinded and whipped, kneeling in his own blood and slaver, he is
Almost instantly worried by the dogs. At the very moment that
Elizabeth took Essex’s head, a giant brown bear
Stood in the gardens with dogs hanging from his fur. . .
He took away the sun, took
A wolfhound in his mouth, and tossed it into
The white lap of Elizabeth I—arrows and staves rained 
On his chest, and standing, he, then, stood even taller, seeing
Into the Queen’s private boxes—he grinned
Into her battered eggshell face.
Another volley of arrows and poles, and opening his mouth
He showered
Blood all over Elizabeth and her Privy Council. 
The very next evening, a cool evening, the Queen demanded
Thirteen bears and the justice of 113 dogs: she slept 
All that Sunday night and much of the next morning.
Some said she was guilty of this and that.
The Protestant Queen gave the defeated bear
A grave in a Catholic cemetery. The marker said:
Peter, a Solstice Bear, a gift of the Tsarevitch to Elizabeth. 
After a long winter she had the grave opened. The bear’s skeleton
Was cleared with lye, she placed it at her bedside,
Put a candle inside behind the sockets of the eyes, and, then
She spoke to it: 
You were a Christmas bear—behind your eyes
I see the walls of a snow cave where you are a cub still smelling
Of your mother’s blood which has dried in your hair; you have
Troubled a Queen who was afraid
When seated in shade which, standing,
You had created! A Queen who often wakes with a dream
Of you at night—
Now, you’ll stand by my bed in your long white bones; alone, you
Will frighten away at night all visions of bear, and all day
You will be in this cold room—your constant grin,
You’ll stand in the long, white prodigy of your bones, and you are, 
Every inch of you, a terrible vision, not bear, but virgin!

                    I love sweets,—
                      heaven
would be dying on a bed of vanilla ice cream ...

But my true self   
is thin, all profile

Only to my husband I’m not simply a “case.”

But he is a fool. He married   
meat, and thought it was a wife.

Why am I a girl?

I ask my doctors, and they tell me they   
don’t know, that it is just “given.”

But it has such   
implications—;
                      and sometimes,

Now, at the beginning of Ellen’s thirty-second year, her physical condition has deteriorated still further. Her use of laxatives increases beyond measure. Every evening she takes sixty to seventy tablets of a laxative, with the result that she suffers tortured vomiting at night and violent diarrhea by day, often accompanied by a weakness of the heart. She has thinned down to a skeleton, and weighs only 92 pounds.

.            .            .

About five years ago, I was in a restaurant,   
eating alone
                   with a book. I was
not married, and often did that ...

—I’d turn down
dinner invitations, so I could eat alone;

I’d allow myself two pieces of bread, with   
butter, at the beginning, and three scoops of   
vanilla ice cream, at the end,—

                                                sitting there alone   
with a book, both in the book
and out of it, waited on, idly
watching people,—

                           when an attractive young man   
and woman, both elegantly dressed,
sat next to me.
                        She was beautiful—;

with sharp, clear features, a good
bone structure—;
                         if she took her make-up off   
in front of you, rubbing cold cream
again and again across her skin, she still would be   
beautiful—
               more beautiful.

And he,—
            I couldn’t remember when I had seen a man   
so attractive. I didn’t know why. He was almost

a male version
                      of her,—

I had the sudden, mad notion that I   
wanted to be his lover ...

—Were they married?
                              were they lovers?

They didn’t wear wedding rings.

Their behavior was circumspect. They discussed   
politics. They didn’t touch ...

—How could I discover?

                                  Then, when the first course   
arrived, I noticed the way

each held his fork out for the other   

to taste what he had ordered ...

                                                 They did this
again and again, with pleased looks, indulgent   
smiles, for each course,
                                     more than once for each dish—;   
much too much for just friends ...

—Their behavior somehow sickened me;

the way each gladly
put the food the other had offered into his mouth—;

I knew what they were. I knew they slept together.   

An immense depression came over me ...

—I knew I could never
with such ease allow another to put food into my mouth:

happily myself put food into another’s mouth—;

I knew that to become a wife I would have to give up my ideal.

.            .            .

Even as a child,
I saw that the “natural” process of aging

is for one’s middle to thicken—
one’s skin to blotch;

as happened to my mother.   
And her mother.
                        I loathed “Nature.”

At twelve, pancakes
became the most terrible thought there is ...

I shall defeat “Nature.”

In the hospital, when they
weigh me, I wear weights secretly sewn into my belt.

January 16. The patient is allowed to eat in her room, but comes readily with her husband to afternoon coffee. Previously she had stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but devoured like a wild animal. This she demonstrated with utmost realism.... Her physical examination showed nothing striking. Salivary glands are markedly enlarged on both sides.
       January 21. Has been reading Faust again. In her diary, writes that art is the “mutual permeation” of the “world of the body” and the “world of the spirit” Says that her own poems are “hospital poems ... weak—without skill or perseverance; only managing to beat their wings softly.”
       February 8. Agitation, quickly subsided again. Has attached herself to an elegant, very thin female patient. Homo-erotic component strikingly evident.
       February 15. Vexation, and torment. Says that her mind forces her always to think of eating. Feels herself degraded by this. Has entirely, for the first time in years, stopped writing poetry.

.            .            .

Callas is my favorite singer, but I’ve only   
seen her once—;

I’ve never forgotten that night ...

—It was in Tosca, she had long before
lost weight, her voice
had been, for years,
                               deteriorating, half itself ...

When her career began, of course, she was fat,

enormous—; in the early photographs,   
sometimes I almost don’t recognize her ...

The voice too then was enormous—
healthy; robust; subtle; but capable of   
crude effects, even vulgar,
                                          almost out of   
high spirits, too much health ...

But soon she felt that she must lose weight,—
that all she was trying to express

was obliterated by her body,
buried in flesh—;
                           abruptly, within
four months, she lost at least sixty pounds ...

—The gossip in Milan was that Callas   
had swallowed a tapeworm.

But of course she hadn’t.

                                       The tapeworm
was her soul ...

—How her soul, uncompromising,   
insatiable,
                  must have loved eating the flesh from her bones,

revealing this extraordinarily
mercurial; fragile; masterly creature ...

—But irresistibly, nothing   
stopped there; the huge voice

also began to change: at first, it simply diminished   
in volume, in size,
                              then the top notes became   
shrill, unreliable—at last,
usually not there at all ...

—No one knows why. Perhaps her mind,   
ravenous, still insatiable, sensed

that to struggle with the shreds of a voice

must make her artistry subtler, more refined,   
more capable of expressing humiliation,   
rage, betrayal ...

—Perhaps the opposite. Perhaps her spirit   
loathed the unending struggle

to embody itself, to manifest itself, on a stage whose

mechanics, and suffocating customs,
seemed expressly designed to annihilate spirit ...

—I know that in Tosca, in the second act,   
when, humiliated, hounded by Scarpia,   
she sang Vissi d’arte
                               —“I lived for art”—   

and in torment, bewilderment, at the end she asks,   
with a voice reaching
                                 harrowingly for the notes,

“Art has repaid me LIKE THIS?”

                                              I felt I was watching   
autobiography—
                     an art; skill;
virtuosity

miles distant from the usual soprano’s   
athleticism,—   
                   the usual musician’s dream   
of virtuosity without content ...
—I wonder what she feels, now,   
listening to her recordings.

For they have already, within a few years,   
begun to date ...

Whatever they express
they express through the style of a decade   
and a half—;
                   a style she helped create ...

—She must know that now
she probably would not do a trill in   
exactly that way,—   
                           that the whole sound, atmosphere,   
dramaturgy of her recordings

have just slightly become those of the past ...

—Is it bitter? Does her soul   
tell her

that she was an idiot ever to think   
anything
             material wholly could satisfy? ...

—Perhaps it says: The only way   
to escape
the History of Styles

is not to have a body.

.            .            .

When I open my eyes in the morning, my great   
mystery
            stands before me ...

—I know that I am intelligent; therefore

the inability not to fear food
day-and-night; this unending hunger
ten minutes after I have eaten ...
                                                    a childish
dread of eating; hunger which can have no cause,—

half my mind says that all this   
is demeaning ...

                         Bread
for days on end
drives all real thought from my brain ...

—Then I think, No. The ideal of being thin

conceals the ideal
not to have a body—;
                               which is NOT trivial ...

This wish seems now as much a “given” of my existence

as the intolerable
fact that I am dark-complexioned; big-boned;   
and once weighed
one hundred and sixty-five pounds ...

—But then I think, No. That’s too simple,—   

without a body, who can
know himself at all?
                               Only by
acting; choosing; rejecting; have I
made myself—
                  discovered who and what Ellen can be ...

—But then again I think, NO. This I is anterior
to name; gender; action;   
fashion;
             MATTER ITSELF,—

... trying to stop my hunger with FOOD   
is like trying to appease thirst   
                                                 with ink.

March 30. Result of the consultation: Both gentlemen agree completely with my prognosis and doubt any therapeutic usefulness of commitment even more emphatically than I. All three of us are agreed that it is not a case of obsessional neurosis and not one of manic-depressive psychosis, and that no definitely reliable therapy is possible. We therefore resolved to give in to the patient’s demand for discharge.

The train-ride yesterday
was far worse than I expected ...

                                                          In our compartment
were ordinary people: a student;   
a woman; her child;—

they had ordinary bodies, pleasant faces;
                                                               but I thought   
I was surrounded by creatures

with the pathetic, desperate
desire to be not what they were:—   

the student was short,
and carried his body as if forcing   
it to be taller—;

the woman showed her gums when she smiled,   
and often held her
hand up to hide them—;

the child
seemed to cry simply because it was   
small; a dwarf, and helpless ...

—I was hungry. I had insisted that my husband   
not bring food ...

After about thirty minutes, the woman   
peeled an orange

to quiet the child. She put a section   
into its mouth—;
                         immediately it spit it out.

The piece fell to the floor.

—She pushed it with her foot through the dirt   
toward me   
several inches.

My husband saw me staring   
down at the piece ...

—I didn’t move; how I wanted   
to reach out,
                     and as if invisible

shove it in my mouth—;

my body
became rigid. As I stared at him,   
I could see him staring

at me,—
          then he looked at the student—; at the woman—; then   
back to me ...

I didn’t move.

—At last, he bent down, and   
casually
             threw it out the window.

He looked away.

—I got up to leave the compartment, then   
saw his face,—

his eyes   
were red;
               and I saw

—I’m sure I saw—

disappointment.

.            .            .

On the third day of being home she is as if transformed. At breakfast she eats butter and sugar, at noon she eats so much that—for the first time in thirteen years!—she is satisfied by her food and gets really full. At afternoon coffee she eats chocolate creams and Easter eggs. She takes a walk with her husband, reads poems, listens to recordings, is in a positively festive mood, and all heaviness seems to have fallen away from her. She writes letters, the last one a letter to the fellow patient here to whom she had become so attached. In the evening she takes a lethal dose of poison, and on the following morning she is dead. “She looked as she had never looked in life—calm and happy and peaceful.”

.            .            .

Dearest.—I remember how
at eighteen,
                   on hikes with friends, when   
they rested, sitting down to joke or talk,

I circled
around them, afraid to hike ahead alone,

yet afraid to rest
when I was not yet truly thin.

You and, yes, my husband,—
you and he

have by degrees drawn me within the circle;   
forced me to sit down at last on the ground.

I am grateful.

But something in me refuses it.

—How eager I have been
to compromise, to kill this refuser,—

but each compromise, each attempt   
to poison an ideal
which often seemed to me sterile and unreal,

heightens my hunger.

I am crippled. I disappoint you.

Will you greet with anger, or   
happiness,

the news which might well reach you   
before this letter?

                              Your Ellen.

The tide’s a Bach cantata.
The beach is the swollen neck of Isaac. 
The tide’s a lamentation of white opals.
The beach is free. The Coke machine rusted out. 
Here is everything you’ll never need: 
hemp-cords, curry-combs, jade and musk,   
a porcelain cup blown into the desert— 
stockings that walked to Syria in 1915. 
On the rocks some ewes and rams   
graze in the outer dark. 
The manes of the shoreline undo your hair.   
A sapphire ring is fingerless. 
The weed and algae are floating like a bed,   
and the bloodless gulls— 
whose breaths would stink of all of us   
if we could kiss them on the beaks— 
are gnawing on the dead.

For Ruth Fainlight



I know the bottom, she says. I know it with my great tap root:   
It is what you fear.
I do not fear it: I have been there. 
Is it the sea you hear in me,   
Its dissatisfactions?
Or the voice of nothing, that was your madness? 
Love is a shadow.
How you lie and cry after it
Listen: these are its hooves: it has gone off, like a horse. 
All night I shall gallop thus, impetuously,
Till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf,   
Echoing, echoing. 
Or shall I bring you the sound of poisons?   
This is rain now, this big hush.
And this is the fruit of it: tin-white, like arsenic. 
I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.   
Scorched to the root
My red filaments burn and stand, a hand of wires. 
Now I break up in pieces that fly about like clubs.   
A wind of such violence
Will tolerate no bystanding: I must shriek. 
The moon, also, is merciless: she would drag me   
Cruelly, being barren.
Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have caught her. 
I let her go. I let her go
Diminished and flat, as after radical surgery.   
How your bad dreams possess and endow me. 
I am inhabited by a cry.   
Nightly it flaps out
Looking, with its hooks, for something to love. 
I am terrified by this dark thing   
That sleeps in me;
All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity. 
Clouds pass and disperse.
Are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables?   
Is it for such I agitate my heart? 
I am incapable of more knowledge.   
What is this, this face
So murderous in its strangle of branches?—— 
Its snaky acids hiss.
It petrifies the will. These are the isolate, slow faults   
That kill, that kill, that kill.


^^EOP^^

All day I tried to distinguish
need from desire. Now, in the dark,
I feel only bitter sadness for us,
the builders, the planers of wood,
because I have been looking
steadily at these elms
and seen the process that creates
the writhing, stationary tree
is torment, and have understood
it will make no forms but twisted forms.

(The fantasia of a fallen gentleman on a cold, bitter night.)



Once, in finesse of fiddles found I ecstasy, In the flash of gold heels on the hard pavement. Now see I That warmth’s the very stuff of poesy. Oh, God, make small The old star-eaten blanket of the sky, That I may fold it round me and in comfort lie.

No one can wish nothing.
Even that death wish sophomores
are nouveau-glib about
reaches for a change of notice. 
“I’ll have you know,” it will say
thirty years later to its son,
“I was once widely recognized
for the quality of my death wish.” 
That was before three years
of navel-reading with a guru
who reluctantly concluded
some souls are bank tellers; 
perhaps more than one would think
at the altitude of Intro. Psych.,
or turned on to a first raga,
or joining Polyglots Anonymous. 
One trouble with this year’s
avant-garde is that it has already
taken it fifty years to be behind
the avant-garde of the twenties 
with the Crash yet to come.
And even free souls buy wives,
fall in love with automobiles,
and marry a mortgage. 
At fifty, semisustained by bourbon,
you wonder what the kids see
in that Galactic Twang
they dance the Cosmic Konk to. 
You will have forgotten such energy,
its illusion of violent freedoms.
You must suffer memory
to understanding in the blare 
of a music that tires you.
There does come a death wish,
but you will be trapped by your
begetting, love what you have given, 
be left waiting in a noise
for the word that must be whispered.
No one can wish nothing. You can
learn to wish for so little 
a word might turn you
all the bent ways to love, its mercies
practiced, its one day at a time
begun and lived and slept on and begun.

What sacramental hurt that brings
The terror of the truth of things
Had changed thee? Secret be it yet.
’T was thine, upon a headland set,
To view no isles of man’s delight,
With lyric foam in rainbow flight,
But all a-swing, a-gleam, mid slow uproar,
Black sea, and curved uncouth sea-bitten shore.

We shall come tomorrow morning, who were not to have her love,   
We shall bring no face of envy but a gift of praise and lilies   
To the stately ceremonial we are not the heroes of. 
Let the sisters now attend her, who are red-eyed, who are wroth;   
They were younger, she was finer, for they wearied of the waiting   
And they married them to merchants, being unbelievers both. 
I was dapper when I dangled in my pepper-and-salt;   
We were only local beauties, and we beautifully trusted
If the proud one had to tarry, one would have her by default. 
But right across the threshold has her grizzled Baron come;
Let them robe her, Bride and Princess, who’ll go down a leafy archway   
And seal her to the Stranger for his castle in the gloom.

On the first page of my dreambook
It’s always evening
In an occupied country.
Hour before the curfew.
A small provincial city.
The houses all dark.
The storefronts gutted. 
I am on a street corner
Where I shouldn’t be.
Alone and coatless
I have gone out to look
For a black dog who answers to my whistle.
I have a kind of Halloween mask
Which I am afraid to put on.

My friends,
As it has been proven in the laboratory,   
An empty pair of dance shoes
Will sit on the floor like a wart
Until it is given a reason to move. 
Those of us who study inertia
(Those of us covered with wild hair and sleep)
Can state this without fear:
The energy in a pair of shoes at rest   
Is about the same as that of a clown 
Knocked flat by a sandbag.
This you can tell your friends with certainty:   
A clown, flat on his back,
Is a lot like an empty pair of
    dancing shoes. 
An empty pair of dancing shoes
Is also a lot like a leaf   
Pressed in a book.
And now you know a simple truth:
A leaf pressed in, say, The Colossus 
    by Sylvia Plath,
Is no different from an empty pair of dance shoes 
Even if those shoes are in the middle of the Stardust Ballroom   
With all the lights on, and hot music shakes the windows   
    up and down the block.
This is the secret of inertia:
The shoes run on their own sense of the world.   
They are in sympathy with the rock the kid skips   
    over the lake
After it settles to the mud.
Not with the ripples,
But with the rock. 
A practical and personal application of inertia
Can be found in the question:   
Whose Turn Is It
To Take Out The Garbage?   
An empty pair of dance shoes
Is a lot like the answer to this question,
As well as book-length poems
Set in the Midwest. 
To sum up:
An empty pair of dance shoes
Is a lot like the sand the 98-pound weakling   
    brushes from his cheeks
As the bully tows away his girlfriend.   
Later, 
When he spies the coupon at the back of the comic book,
He is about to act upon a different set of scientific principles.   
He is ready to dance.

I asked for much; I received much.
I asked for much; I received little, I received
next to nothing. 
And between? A few umbrellas opened indoors.
A pair of shoes by mistake on the kitchen table. 
O wrong, wrong—it was my nature. I was
hard-hearted, remote. I was
selfish, rigid to the point of tyranny. 
But I was always that person, even in early childhood.
Small, dark-haired, dreaded by the other children.
I never changed. Inside the glass, the abstract
tide of fortune turned
from high to low overnight. 
Was it the sea? Responding, maybe,
to celestial force? To be safe,
I prayed. I tried to be a better person.
Soon it seemed to me that what began as terror
and matured into moral narcissism
might have become in fact
actual human growth. Maybe
this is what my friends meant, taking my hand,
telling me they understood
the abuse, the incredible shit I accepted,
implying (so I once thought) I was a little sick
to give so much for so little.
Whereas they meant I was good (clasping my hand intensely)—
a good friend and person, not a creature of pathos. 
I was not pathetic! I was writ large,
like a queen or a saint. 
Well, it all makes for interesting conjecture.
And it occurs to me that what is crucial is to believe
in effort, to believe some good will come of simply trying,
a good completely untainted by the corrupt initiating impulse
to persuade or seduce— 
What are we without this?
Whirling in the dark universe,
alone, afraid, unable to influence fate— 
What do we have really?
Sad tricks with ladders and shoes,
tricks with salt, impurely motivated recurring
attempts to build character.
What do we have to appease the great forces? 
And I think in the end this was the question
that destroyed Agamemnon, there on the beach,
the Greek ships at the ready, the sea
invisible beyond the serene harbor, the future
lethal, unstable: he was a fool, thinking
it could be controlled. He should have said I have nothing, I am at your mercy.

See this house, how dark it is Beneath its vast-boughed trees! Not one trembling leaflet cries To that Watcher in the skies—‘Remove, remove thy searching gaze, Innocent of heaven’s ways, Brood not, Moon, so wildly bright, On secrets hidden from sight.’
‘Secrets,’ sighs the night-wind, ‘Vacancy is all I find;Every keyhole I have madeWails a summons, faint and sad, No voice ever answers me,
     Only vacancy.’‘Once, once … ’ the cricket shrills, And far and near the quiet fills With its tiny voice, and then
     Hush falls again.
Mute shadows creeping slowMark how the hours go.Every stone is mouldering slow. And the least winds that blow Some minutest atom shake,Some fretting ruin makeIn roof and walls. How black it is Beneath these thick boughed trees!

“There was poverty before money.”



There was debtors’ prison before inmates,  there was hunger prefossil,  there was pain before a nervous system  to convey it to the brain, there existed  poverty before intelligence, or accountants,  before narration; there was bankruptcy aswirl  in nowhere, it was palpable where nothing was palpable, there was repossession  in the gasses forming so many billion ... ; there was poverty—it had a tongue—in cooling  ash, in marl, and coming loam, thirst in the few strands of hay slipping  between a pitchfork’s wide tines,  in the reptile and the first birds,  poverty aloof and no mystery like God  its maker; there was surely want  in one steamed and sagging onion,  there was poverty in the shard of bread  sopped in the final drop of gravy you snatched from your brother’s mouth.

We were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn.
A red wing rose in the darkness. 
And suddenly a hare ran across the road.
One of us pointed to it with his hand. 
That was long ago. Today neither of them is alive,
Not the hare, nor the man who made the gesture. 
O my love, where are they, where are they going
The flash of a hand, streak of movement, rustle of pebbles.
I ask not out of sorrow, but in wonder.  
                                                         Wilno, 1936

The country lies flat, expressionless as the face of a stranger.   
Not one hillock shelters a buried bone. The city:
a scene thin as a theater backdrop, where no doors open,   
no streets extend beyond the view from the corner. 
Only the railroad embankment is high, shaggy with grass.   
Only the freight, knuckling a red sun under its wheels,   
drags familiar box-car shapes down long perspectives   
of childhood meals and all crossings at sunset. 
With a look deep as the continent, with the casual greeting   
of those who will meet again, it bestrides the viaduct.   
Its span is the span of trestles above mountain gorges,   
its roar the echo of streams still wearing away stone.

Sweet smell of phlox drifting across the lawn—
an early warning of the end of summer.
August is fading fast, and by September
the little purple flowers will all be gone. 
Season, project, and vacation done.
One more year in everybody’s life.
Add a notch to the old hunting knife
Time keeps testing with a horny thumb. 
Over the summer months hung an unspoken
aura of urgency. In late July
galactic pulsings filled the midnight sky
like silent screaming, so that, strangely woken, 
we looked at one another in the dark,
then at the milky magical debris
arcing across, dwarfing our meek mortality.
There were two ways to live: get on with work, 
redeem the time, ignore the imminence
of cataclysm; or else take it slow,
be as tranquil as the neighbors’ cow
we love to tickle through the barbed wire fence
(she paces through her days in massive innocence,
or, seeing green pastures, we imagine so). 
In fact, not being cows, we have no choice.
Summer or winter, country, city, we
are prisoners from the start and automatically,
hemmed in, harangued by the one clamorous voice. 
Not light but language shocks us out of sleep
ideas of doom transformed to meteors
we translate back to portents of the wars
looming above the nervous watch we keep.

The bird had come to the very end of its song
and the tree was dissolving under its claws. 
And in the sky the clouds were twisting
and darkness flowed through all the cracks
into the sinking vessel of the landscape. 
Only in the telegraph wires
a message still
crackled: 
C-.-o---m--e. h...o---m--e.
y-.--o---u..- h...a.-v...-e.
a.-s...o---n-.

Over the still world, a bird calls
waking solitary among black boughs. 
You wanted to be born; I let you be born.
When has my grief ever gotten
in the way of your pleasure? 
Plunging ahead
into the dark and light at the same time
eager for sensation 
as though you were some new thing, wanting
to express yourselves 
all brilliance, all vivacity 
never thinking
this would cost you anything,
never imagining the sound of my voice
as anything but part of you— 
you won't hear it in the other world,
not clearly again,
not in birdcall or human cry, 
not the clear sound, only
persistent echoing
in all sound that means good-bye, good-bye— 
the one continuous line
that binds us to each other.

An old, mad, blind, despised, and dying King; Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow Through public scorn,—mud from a muddy spring; Rulers who neither see nor feel nor know, But leechlike to their fainting country cling Till they drop, blind in blood, without a blow. A people starved and stabbed in th' untilled field; An army, whom liberticide and prey Makes as a two-edged sword to all who wield; Golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay; Religion Christless, Godless—a book sealed; A senate, Time’s worst statute, unrepealed— Are graves from which a glorious Phantom may Burst, to illumine our tempestuous day.

If we could get the hang of it entirely
   It would take too long;
All we know is the splash of words in passing   
   And falling twigs of song,
And when we try to eavesdrop on the great   
   Presences it is rarely
That by a stroke of luck we can appropriate   
   Even a phrase entirely. 
If we could find our happiness entirely
   In somebody else’s arms
We should not fear the spears of the spring nor the city’s
   Yammering fire alarms
But, as it is, the spears each year go through
   Our flesh and almost hourly   
Bell or siren banishes the blue   
   Eyes of Love entirely. 
And if the world were black or white entirely
   And all the charts were plain
Instead of a mad weir of tigerish waters,
   A prism of delight and pain,
We might be surer where we wished to go   
   Or again we might be merely
Bored but in brute reality there is no
   Road that is right entirely.

And still nothing happens. I am not arrested.   
By some inexplicable oversight 
nobody jeers when I walk down the street. 
I have been allowed to go on living in this   
room. I am not asked to explain my presence   
anywhere. 
What posthypnotic suggestions were made; and   
are any left unexecuted? 
Why am I so distressed at the thought of taking   
certain jobs? 
They are absolutely shameless at the bank——
You’d think my name meant nothing to them. Non-
chalantly they hand me the sum I’ve requested, 
but I know them. It’s like this everywhere—— 
they think they are going to surprise me: I,   
who do nothing but wait. 
Once I answered the phone, and the caller hung up——
very clever. 
They think that they can scare me.    
I am always scared. 
And how much courage it requires to get up in the   
morning and dress yourself. Nobody congratulates   
you! 
At no point in the day may I fall to my knees and   
refuse to go on, it’s not done. 
I go on 
dodging cars that jump the curb to crush my hip, 
accompanied by abrupt bursts of black-and-white
laughter and applause, 
past a million unlighted windows, peered out at   
by the retired and their aged attack-dogs— 
toward my place, 
the one at the end of the counter,    
the scalpel on the napkin.

Go where those others went to the dark boundary
for the golden fleece of nothingness your last prize 
go upright among those who are on their knees
among those with their backs turned and those toppled in the dust 
you were saved not in order to live
you have little time you must give testimony 
be courageous when the mind deceives you be courageous
in the final account only this is important 
and let your helpless Anger be like the sea
whenever you hear the voice of the insulted and beaten 
let your sister Scorn not leave you
for the informers executioners cowards—they will win
they will go to your funeral and with relief will throw a lump of earth
the woodborer will write your smoothed-over biography 
and do not forgive truly it is not in your power
to forgive in the name of those betrayed at dawn 
beware however of unnecessary pride
keep looking at your clown’s face in the mirror
repeat: I was called—weren’t there better ones than I 
beware of dryness of heart love the morning spring
the bird with an unknown name the winter oak 
light on a wall the splendour of the sky
they don’t need your warm breath
they are there to say: no one will console you 
be vigilant—when the light on the mountains gives the sign—arise and go
as long as blood turns in the breast your dark star 
repeat old incantations of humanity fables and legends
because this is how you will attain the good you will not attain
repeat great words repeat them stubbornly
like those crossing the desert who perished in the sand 
and they will reward you with what they have at hand
with the whip of laughter with murder on a garbage heap 
go because only in this way will you be admitted to the company of cold skulls
to the company of your ancestors: Gilgamesh Hector Roland
the defenders of the kingdom without limit and the city of ashes 
Be faithful Go

One day in that room, a small rat.   
Two days later, a snake. 
Who, seeing me enter,
whipped the long stripe of his   
body under the bed,
then curled like a docile house-pet. 
I don’t know how either came or left.   
Later, the flashlight found nothing. 
For a year I watched
as something—terror? happiness? grief?—
entered and then left my body. 
Not knowing how it came in,   
Not knowing how it went out. 
It hung where words could not reach it.   
It slept where light could not go.
Its scent was neither snake nor rat,   
neither sensualist nor ascetic. 
There are openings in our lives   
of which we know nothing. 
Through them
the belled herds travel at will,
long-legged and thirsty, covered with foreign dust.


^^EOP^^

The snake, alphabet of one glide, swims
with its keepsake head, periscoping, and then 
we lose it in the pond grass, lashed
among the bottom-feeders. Pocketing goggles, 
my gaze tends pineward, to the driest sky
in twenty years (also passing, rain predicted), 
a month of sun days. In Fairbanks, all-night baseball
and a picnic breakfast Alaskan-style. Someone’s 
driving south, to Anchorage, in that luscious uplift
that here will linger long enough for us 
to get a sunburn, to get down, to get stung,
to get the hang of happiness and get going. 
Get the picture? I do, but just for the moment,
which is why I want it monumental, equestrian, 
astride, however I can get it. What’s
passing is June, another; peony’s scent; postcards 
from the lower forty-eight. The frog I trod sprang back
intact, all its receptors set on July.


^^EOP^^

Those blessèd structures, plot and rhyme—
why are they no help to me now
I want to make
something imagined, not recalled?
I hear the noise of my own voice: The painter’s vision is not a lens,
it trembles to caress the light.

^^EOP^^

We walk by the sea-shore
holding firmly in our hands
the two ends of an antique dialogue
—do you love me?
—I love you 
with furrowed eyebrows
I summarize all wisdom
of the two testaments
astrologers prophets
philosophers of the gardens
and cloistered philosophers 
and it sounds about like this:
—don’t cry
—be brave
—look how everybody 
you pout your lips and say
—you should be a clergyman
and fed up you walk off
nobody loves moralists 
    what should I say on the shore of
    a small dead sea 
    slowly the water fills
    the shapes of feet which have vanished

Think not this paper comes with vain pretenseTo move your pity, or to mourn th’ offense.Too well I know that hard obdurate heart;No softening mercy there will take my part,Nor can a woman’s arguments prevail,When even your patron’s wise example fails.But this last privilege I still retain;Th’ oppressed and injured always may complain.
  Too, too severely laws of honor bindThe weak submissive sex of womankind.If sighs have gained or force compelled our hand,Deceived by art, or urged by stern command,Whatever motive binds the fatal tie,The judging world expects our constancy.
  Just heaven! (for sure in heaven does justice reign,Though tricks below that sacred name profane)To you appealing I submit my cause.Nor fear a judgment from impartial laws.All bargains but conditional are made;The purchase void, the creditor unpaid;Defrauded servants are from service free;A wounded slave regains his liberty.For wives ill used no remedy remains,To daily racks condemned, and to eternal chains.
  From whence is this unjust distinction grown?Are we not formed with passions like your own?Nature with equal fire our souls endued,Our minds as haughty, and as warm our blood;O’er the wide world your pleasures you pursue,The change is justified by something new;But we must sigh in silence—and be true.Our sex’s weakness you expose and blame(Of every prattling fop the common theme),Yet from this weakness you suppose is dueSublimer virtue than your Cato knew.Had heaven designed us trials so severe,It would have formed our tempers then to bear.
  And I have borne (oh what have I not borne!)The pang of jealousy, the insults of scorn.Wearied at length, I from your sight remove,And place my future hopes in secret love.In the gay bloom of glowing youth retired,I quit the woman’s joy to be admired,With that small pension your hard heart allows,Renounce your fortune, and release your vows.To custom (though unjust) so much is due;I hide my frailty from the public view.My conscience clear, yet sensible of shame,My life I hazard, to preserve my fame.And I prefer this low inglorious stateTo vile dependence on the thing I hate—But you pursue me to this last retreat.Dragged into light, my tender crime is shownAnd every circumstance of fondness known.Beneath the shelter of the law you stand,And urge my ruin with a cruel hand,While to my fault thus rigidly severe,Tamely submissive to the man you fear.
  This wretched outcast, this abandoned wife,Has yet this joy to sweeten shameful life:By your mean conduct, infamously loose,You are at once my accuser and excuse.Let me be damned by the censorious prude(Stupidly dull, or spiritually lewd),My hapless case will surely pity findFrom every just and reasonable mind.When to the final sentence I submit,The lips condemn me, but their souls aquit.
  No more my husband, to your pleasures go,The sweets of your recovered freedom know.Go: court the brittle friendship of the great,Smile at his board, or at his levee wait;And when dismissed, to madam’s toilet fly,More than her chambermaids, or glasses, lie,Tell her how young she looks, how heavenly fair,Admire the lilies and the roses there.Your high ambition may be gratified,Some cousin of her own be made your bride,And you the father of a glorious raceEndowed with Ch——l’s strength and Low——r’s face.

As some fond virgin, whom her mother’s careDrags from the town to wholesome country air, Just when she learns to roll a melting eye, And hear a spark, yet think no danger nigh;From the dear man unwillingly she must sever,Yet takes one kiss before she parts for ever:Thus from the world fair Zephalinda flew,Saw others happy, and with sighs withdrew;Not that their pleasures caused her discontent,She sighed not that They stayed, but that She went.
  She went, to plain-work, and to purling brooks,Old-fashioned halls, dull aunts, and croaking rooks,She went from Opera, park, assembly, play,To morning walks, and prayers three hours a day;To pass her time ‘twixt reading and Bohea,To muse, and spill her solitary tea,Or o’er cold coffee trifle with the spoon,Count the slow clock, and dine exact at noon;Divert her eyes with pictures in the fire,Hum half a tune, tell stories to the squire;Up to her godly garret after seven,There starve and pray, for that’s the way to heaven.
 Some Squire, perhaps, you take a delight to rack; Whose game is Whisk, whose treat a toast in sack,Who visits with a gun, presents you birds,Then gives a smacking buss, and cries – No words!Or with his hound comes hollowing from the stable,Makes love with nods, and knees beneath a table;Whose laughs are hearty, tho’ his jests are coarse,And loves you best of all things – but his horse.
  In some fair evening, on your elbow laid,Your dream of triumphs in the rural shade;In pensive thought recall the fancied scene,See Coronations rise on every green;Before you pass th’ imaginary sightsOf Lords, and Earls, and Dukes, and gartered Knights;While the spread fan o’ershades your closing eyes;Then give one flirt, and all the vision flies.Thus vanish scepters, coronets, and balls,And leave you in lone woods, or empty walls.
  So when your slave, at some dear, idle time,(Not plagued with headaches, or the want of rhyme)Stands in the streets, abstracted from the crew,And while he seems to study, thinks of you:Just when his fancy points your sprightly eyes,Or sees the blush of soft Parthenia rise,Gay pats my shoulder, and you vanish quite;Streets, chairs, and coxcombs rush upon my sight;Vexed to be still in town, I knit my brow,Look sour, and hum a tune – as you may now.

On her Son H.P. at St. Syth’s Church where her body also lies interred



What on Earth deserves our trust?
Youth and Beauty both are dust.
Long we gathering are with pain,
What one moment calls again.
Seven years childless marriage past,
A Son, a son is born at last:
So exactly lim’d and fair,
Full of good Spirits, Meen, and Air,
As a long life promised,
Yet, in less than six weeks dead.
Too promising, too great a mind
In so small room to be confined:
Therefore, as fit in Heaven to dwell,
He quickly broke the Prison shell.
So the subtle Alchemist,
Can’t with Hermes Seal resist
The powerful spirit’s subtler flight,
But t’will bid him long good night.
And so the Sun if it arise
Half so glorious as his Eyes,
Like this Infant, takes a shrowd,
Buried in a morning Cloud.


^^EOP^^

For this she starred her eyes with salt
And scooped her temples thin,
Until her face shone pure of fault
From the forehead to the chin. 
In coldest crucibles of pain
Her shrinking flesh was fired
And smoothed into a finer grain
To make it more desired. 
Pain left her lips more clear than glass;
It colored and cooled her hand.
She lay a field of scented grass
Yielded as pasture land. 
For this her loveliness was curved
And carved as silver is:
For this she was brave: but she deserved
A better grave than this.


^^EOP^^

She has attained the permanence
She dreamed of, where old stones lie sunning.
Untended stalks blow over her
Even and swift, like young men running. 
Always in the heart she loved
Others had lived,—she heard their laughter.
She lies where none has lain before,
Where certainly none will follow after.

Here lies, whom hound did ne’er pursue,     Nor swifter greyhound follow, Whose foot ne’er tainted morning dew,     Nor ear heard huntsman’s hallo’,  Old Tiney, surliest of his kind,     Who, nursed with tender care, And to domesticate bounds confined,     Was still a wild jack-hare.  Though duly from my hand he took     His pittance every night, He did it with a jealous look,     And, when he could, would bite.  His diet was of wheaten bread,     And milk, and oats, and straw, Thistles, or lettuces instead,     With sand to scour his maw.  On twigs of hawthorn he regaled,     On pippins’ russet peel; And, when his juicy salads failed,     Sliced carrot pleased him well.  A Turkey carpet was his lawn,     Whereon he loved to bound, To skip and gambol like a fawn,     And swing his rump around.  His frisking was at evening hours,     For then he lost his fear; But most before approaching showers,     Or when a storm drew near.  Eight years and five round-rolling moons     He thus saw steal away, Dozing out all his idle noons,     And every night at play.  I kept him for his humor’s sake,     For he would oft beguile My heart of thoughts that made it ache,     And force me to a smile.  But now, beneath this walnut-shade     He finds his long, last home, And waits in snug concealment laid,     Till gentler Puss shall come.  He, still more agèd, feels the shocks     From which no care can save, And, partner once of Tiney’s box,     Must soon partake his grave.

Why hast thou nothing in thy face? Thou idol of the human race, Thou tyrant of the human heart, The flower of lovely youth that art; Yea, and that standest in thy youth An image of eternal Truth, With thy exuberant flesh so fair, That only Pheidias might compare, Ere from his chaste marmoreal form Time had decayed the colours warm; Like to his gods in thy proud dress, Thy starry sheen of nakedness.  Surely thy body is thy mind, For in thy face is nought to find, Only thy soft unchristen’d smile, That shadows neither love nor guile, But shameless will and power immense, In secret sensuous innocence.  O king of joy, what is thy thought? I dream thou knowest it is nought, And wouldst in darkness come, but thou Makest the light where’er thou go. Ah yet no victim of thy grace, None who e’er long’d for thy embrace, Hath cared to look upon thy face.

She fears him, and will always ask    What fated her to choose him; She meets in his engaging mask                      All reasons to refuse him; But what she meets and what she fears Are less than are the downward years, Drawn slowly to the foamless weirs    Of age, were she to lose him.  Between a blurred sagacity    That once had power to sound him, And Love, that will not let him be    The Judas that she found him, Her pride assuages her almost, As if it were alone the cost.— He sees that he will not be lost,    And waits and looks around him.  A sense of ocean and old trees    Envelops and allures him; Tradition, touching all he sees    Beguiles and reassures him; And all her doubts of what he says Are dimmed with what she knows of days— Till even prejudice delays    And fades, and she secures him.  The falling leaf inaugurates    The reign of her confusion; The pounding wave reverberates    The dirge of her illusion; And home, where passion lived and died, Becomes a place where she can hide, While all the town and harbor side    Vibrate with her seclusion.  We tell you, tapping on our brows,    The story as it should be,— As if the story of a house    Were told, or ever could be; We’ll have no kindly veil between Her visions and those we have seen,— As if we guessed what hers have been,    Or what they are or would be.  Meanwhile we do no harm; for they    That with a god have striven, Not hearing much of what we say,    Take what the god has given; Though like waves breaking it may be, Or like a changed familiar tree, Or like a stairway to the sea    Where down the blind are driven.

Then the cicadas again like kindling that won’t take.
The struck match of some utopia we no longer remember   
                                                   the terms of—
the rules. What was it was going to be abolished, what   
restored? Behind them the foghorn in the harbor,   
the hoarse announcements of unhurried arrivals,
the spidery virgin-shrieks of gulls, a sideways sound, a slippery   
                                                            utterly ash-free
delinquency
and then the subaqueous pasturings       inexhaustible
phosphorous handwritings the frothings of their own excitements now   
erase, depth wrestling with the current-corridors of depth ...   
But here, up on the hill, in town,
the clusterings of dwellings in balconied crystal-formation,   
the cadaverous swallowings of the dream of reason gone,
hot fingerprints where thoughts laid out these streets, these braceletings   
of park and government—a hospital—a dirt-bike run—
here, we stand in our hysteria with our hands in our pockets,   
quiet, at the end of day, looking out, theories stationary,   
while the freight, the crazy wick, once more slides down—
marionette-like its being lowered in—
marionette-strung our outwaiting its bloody translation ...   
Utopia: remember the sensation of direction we loved,   
how it tunneled forwardly for us,
and us so feudal in its wake—
speckling of diamond-dust as I think of it now,
that being carried forward by the notion of human   
perfectibility—like a pasture imposed
on the rising vibrancy of endless diamond-dust ...
And how we would comply, some day. How we were built to fit and   
                                                                         comply—
as handwriting fits to the form of its passion,
no, to the form of its passionate bearer’s fingerprintable i.d.,
or, no, to the handkerchief she brings now to her haunted face,   
lifting the sunglasses to wipe away
the theory—or is it the tears?—the freight now all   
in her right hand, in the oceanic place we’d pull up   
through her wrist—we’d siphon right up—
marionette with her leavening of mother-of-pearl—
how she wants to be legible, how the light streaking her shades now   
                                                            grows vermilion,
which she would capture of course, because that, she has heard,   
from the rumorous diamond-dust, is what is required,   
as also her spirit—now that it has been swallowed
like a lustrous hailstone by her unquenchable body—suggests—the zero   
at the heart of the christened bonfire—oh little grimace, kiss, solo   
at the heart—growing refined, tiny missionary, in your brightskirted   
                                                                           host,
scorched comprehension—because that is what’s required,   
her putting down now the sunset onto that page,
as an expression of her deepest undertowing sentiment,
which spidery gestures, tongued-over the molecular whiteness,   
squared out and stretched and made to resemble emptiness,   
will take down the smoldering in the terms of her passion
—sunglasses on the table, telephone ringing—
and be carried across the tongue-tied ocean,
through dusk, right through it, over prisons, over tiny clapboard houses   
to which the bartender returns, exhausted, after work,   
over flare-ups of civil strife, skeletons rotting in the arms of   
skeletons, the foliage all round them gleaming,
the green belly-up god we thought we’d seen the last of,
shuddering his sleep off, first fruit hanging ripe—oh bright red zero—
right there within reach, that he too may be nourished,   
you know this of course, what has awakened which we thought we’d   
                                                                   extinguished,
us still standing here sword in hand, hand extended,   
frail, over the limpid surface of the lake-like page,
the sleep-like page, now folded and gently driven into
its envelope, for the tiny journey, over offices, over sacrifices,   
to its particular address, at the heart of the metropolis,   
where someone else is waiting, hailstone at the core,   
and the heat is too great, friend, the passion in its envelope,   
doors slamming, traffic backing-up, the populace not really   
abandoned, not really, just very tired on its long red errancy   
down the freeways in the dusklight
towards the little town on the hill—the crystal-formation?—
how long ago was it we said that? do you remember?—
and now that you’ve remembered—and the distance we’ve   
traveled—and where we were, then—and
how little we’ve found—aren’t we tired? aren’t we   
going to close the elaborate folder
which holds the papers in their cocoon of possibility,   
the folder so pretty with its massive rose-blooms,
oh perpetual bloom, dread fatigue, and drowsiness like leavening I

In one dream I am made watchful.
In this dream the name we never clearly have heard   
is spoken, which name, if we knew 
and could speak it, would call back to us   
those whom in time we will have come to love   
and who will die; would bring them back to us 
like us abandoned again
to his terrible consequence,   
the silence between us 
forever affirmed. And in whatever   
might constitute the pardon   
would come down in a fragile rain 
the whole matter of all
we will ever love, the whole
fiery blade of space, ten billions of suns 
suddenly blossoming small and cool   
as snowdrops over the opening graves,   
the world shimmering with the blue 
delicate membrane of the fallen sky,
while above us the forsaken voice calls out    come back come back 
as if calling the name
each of us had long forgotten
until that very instant not remembered 
as proper to our hearts.

Evening! as slow thy placid shades descend,       Veiling with gentlest hush the landscape still,       The lonely battlement, the farthest hill And wood, I think of those who have no friend; Who now, perhaps, by melancholy led,       From the broad blaze of day, where pleasure flaunts,       Retiring, wander to the ring-dove’s haunts Unseen; and watch the tints that o’er thy bed Hang lovely; oft to musing Fancy’s eye       Presenting fairy vales, where the tir’d mind       Might rest beyond the murmurs of mankind, Nor hear the hourly moans of misery! Alas for man! that Hope’s fair views the while Should smile like you, and perish as they smile!

I have forgotten the words,
and therefore I shall not conceive
of a mysterious salvation, I shall
not become a tall lily and bloom
into blue and white. Then what
oracular event shall appear on
my doorstep? What announcement
shall crowd me to a corner,
protesting an unworthiness,
which doubtless shall be believed? 
But these are only bells we hear,
pulled down by the arms of the
drunken janitor, two fingers missing
on his left hand. And we have
climbed into that tower, its spiraling
wooden staircase creaking beneath our
feet. We have seen for ourselves
that it is only iron that rings, iron
swinging on an iron bar, the rough rope
threading down to the cold ground,
no death or holiness in
those hollow shells.

The evening darkens over After a day so bright The windcapt waves discover That wild will be the night. There’s sound of distant thunder.  The latest sea-birds hover Along the cliff’s sheer height; As in the memory wander Last flutterings of delight, White wings lost on the white.  There’s not a ship in sight; And as the sun goes under Thick clouds conspire to cover The moon that should rise yonder. Thou art alone, fond lover.

Now comes the evening of the mind.
Here are the fireflies twitching in the blood;
Here is the shadow moving down the page
Where you sit reading by the garden wall.
Now the dwarf peach trees, nailed to their trellises,
Shudder and droop. You know their voices now,
Faintly the martyred peaches crying out
Your name, the name nobody knows but you.
It is the aura and the coming on.
It is the thing descending, circling, here.
And now it puts a claw out and you take it.
Thankfully in your lap you take it, so. 
You said you would not go away again,
You did not want to go away—and yet,
It is as if you stood out on the dock
Watching a little boat drift out
Beyond the sawgrass shallows, the dead fish ...
And you were in it, skimming past old snags,
Beyond, beyond, under a brazen sky
As soundless as a gong before it’s struck—
Suspended how?—and now they strike it, now
The ether dream of five-years-old repeats, repeats,
And you must wake again to your own blood
And empty spaces in the throat.

I asked my father,
“would you rather die
of cancer or a heart attack?
Would you rather be executed
or put in jail for life?
Which would you rather be—
a spy or a sentinel?”
And he tried to answer
honestly, combing his thinning hair
with his fingers, thinking of something else.
At last he fell silent. I ran out
to savor the dregs of dusk
playing with my friends
in the road that led to the highway.
The ball flew up toward day
and landed in night.
We chanted. Every other minute
a truck, summoned by our warnings,
brushed past in a gust of light,
the driver’s curses muffled
by distance: the oncoming wheels
were the point of the game,
like the scores in chalk
or the blood from scuffed knees
that we smeared across our faces:
so when my mother called,
her voice was quaint and stymied
and I took all the time in the world
trotting home past tarped barbecue pits,
past names of lovers filling with sap,
past tentative wind from sprinklers:
then I was stunned to see my golden window
where all faces, hanging plants, dangling pots
were framed by night and dwarfed
by a ravenous inward-turning light.


^^EOP^^

BODY       Farewell! I go to sleep; but when
    The day-star springs, I’ll wake again.
 SOUL       Go, sleep in peace; and when thou liestUnnumber’d in thy dust, when all this frameIs but one dram, and what thou now descriest
    In sev’ral parts shall want a name,Then may his peace be with thee, and each dustWrit in his book, who ne’er betray’d man’s trust!
 BODY       Amen! but hark, ere we two stray
    How many hours dost think ’till day?
 SOUL       Ah go; th’art weak, and sleepy. Heav’nIs a plain watch, and without figures windsAll ages up; who drew this circle, even
    He fills it; days and hours are blinds.Yet this take with thee. The last gasp of timeIs thy first breath, and man’s eternal prime.

When a man knows another man
Is looking for him
He doesn’t hide. 
He doesn’t wait
To spend another night
With his wife
Or put his children to sleep. 
He puts on a clean shirt and a dark suit
And goes to the barber shop
To let another man shave him. 
He shuts his eyes
Remembers himself as a boy
Lying naked on a rock by the water. 
Then he asks for the special lotion.
The old men line up by the chair
And the barber pours a little
In each of their hands.


^^EOP^^

Wipe away tears,
Set free your fears:
Everything is free.
Only the lonely
Need much money:
Everything is free.
Don’t try to bind
The love you find:
Everyone is free.
Your lover’s yours —
Surrender force:
Everyone is free.
The sun melts down,
Spreads gold around:
Everything is free.
The rain is spent
Lending flowers scent:
Everything is free.
The love you live,
The life you give:
Everything is free.

From the tawny light
from the rainy nights
from the imagination finding
itself and more than itself
alone and more than alone
at the bottom of the well where the moon lives,   
can you pull me 
into December? a lowland
of space, perception of space
towering of shadows of clouds blown upon
clouds over
                  new ground, new made
under heavy December footsteps? the only
way to live?

They pay us time and a half
and don’t dare catch us
drinking: we don’t insist,
don’t pass a bottle, but each sips
a private pint, all sitting
in the narrow room with our backs
to the center, each facing
his work—router, stain tray,
buffing wheel, drill press—
and with that sweet taste echoing
in our bones, we watch our hands
make what they always made
—rosewood handles—but now
we smile in delighted surprise
and Marchesi brings envelopes
that record a full day’s work
though it’s still noon,
processions still fill the streets,
choirs, loudspeakers bellowing
Hallelujah: and we change
into our finest clothes in the locker room,
admiring each other’s hat brims, passing bottles
freely until all are empty, and at last
we separate in the brilliant street, each
in the direction of a different tolling bell.

Fingers:
Cramped, you are hardly anything but fidgets.
We, active, differentiate the digits:
Whilst you are merely little toe and big
(Or, in the nursery, some futile pig)
Through vital use as pincers there has come
Distinction of the finger and the thumb;
Lacking a knuckle you have sadly missed
Our meaningful translation to a fist;
And only by the curling of that joint
Could the firm index come to have a point.
You cannot punch or demonstrate or hold
And therefore cannot write or pluck or mould:
Indeed, it seems deficiency in art
Alone would prove you the inferior part. 
   Toes:
Not so, my friends. Our clumsy innocence
And your deft sin is the main difference
Between the body’s near extremities.
Please do not think that we intend to please:
Shut in the dark, we once were free like you.
Though you enslaved us, are you not slaves, too?
Our early balance caused your later guilt,
Erect, of finding out how we were built.
Your murders and discoveries compile
A history of the crime of being agile,
And we it is who save you when you fight
Against the odds: you cannot take to flight.
Despite your fabrications and your cunning,
The deepest instinct is expressed in running.

Merchants have multiplied more than the stars of heaven.   
Half the population are like the long grasshoppers   
That sleep in the bushes in the cool of the day;
The sound of their wings is heard at noon, muffled, near the earth.
The crane handler dies; the taxi driver dies, slumped over   
In his taxi. Meanwhile high in the air an executive   
Walks on cool floors, and suddenly falls.
Dying, he dreams he is lost in a snowbound mountain   
On which he crashed, carried at night by great machines.   
As he lies on the wintry slope, cut off and dying,   
A pine stump talks to him of Goethe and Jesus.   
Commuters arrive in Hartford at dusk like moles   
Or hares flying from a fire behind them,
And the dusk in Hartford is full of their sighs.
Their trains come through the air like a dark music,
Like the sound of horns, the sound of thousands of small wings.

These hills are sandy. Trees are dwarfed here. Crows
Caw dismally in skies of an arid brilliance,
Complain in dusty pine-trees. Yellow daybreak
Lights on the long brown slopes a frost-like dew,
Dew as heavy as rain; the rabbit tracks
Show sharply in it, as they might in snow.
But it’s soon gone in the sun—what good does it do?
The houses, on the slope, or among brown trees,
Are grey and shrivelled. And the men who live here
Are small and withered, spider-like, with large eyes. 
Bring water with you if you come to live here—
Cold tinkling cisterns, or else wells so deep
That one looks down to Ganges or Himalayas.
Yes, and bring mountains with you, white, moon-bearing,
Mountains of ice. You will have need of these
Profundities and peaks of wet and cold. 
Bring also, in a cage of wire or osier,
Birds of a golden colour, who will sing
Of leaves that do not wither, watery fruits
That heavily hang on long melodious boughs
In the blue-silver forests of deep valleys. 
I have now been here—how many years? Years unnumbered.
My hands grow clawlike. My eyes are large and starved.
I brought no bird with me, I have no cistern
Where I might find the moon, or river, or snow.
Some day, for lack of these, I’ll spin a web
Between two dusty pine-tree tops, and hang there
Face downward, like a spider, blown as lightly
As ghost of leaf. Crows will caw about me.
Morning and evening I shall drink the dew.

for Kwame Dawes



Your scuttled pays floats—fiery—in the ether;
Blazing, it vomits smudge-smoke. Your mind chars
Black because you yaw—moth-like—too near flames.
You douse your dream-scorched brain with slave-sweat rum—
The only gold you can own, corroding
Your liver. Your anthem plays to gunfire.
When you think about it (when you can breathe)—
After all the lies that frame nostalgia,
All the dead faces that occupy photographs,
All the slain lovers pitched into ditches,
Your eyes itch and ache with water, then dry—
Curling like dead leaves, starving for gold fire.

It was homemade and primitive,   
like pulling a tooth with a string
and a slamming door, like taking out
an appendix by kerosene light
where dogs wandered in and out
the dirt-floored room.
Nothing for the pain that
everyone wanted to examine,   
the twisted heart they thought
they could shout back into place. 
Moaning and fluttering their fleshy hands
on the wind, on the wail of the soul possessed,   
they certified her in a manner Inquisitional,   
frantic when she held to the grip of darkness,   
grimly determined to wait the thing out,   
something learned from movie sheriffs,   
white hats ghostly in the moonlight. 
When she would not answer (though they
conjured her by heaven and by the all
mighty names they knew), they laid hands
on her and shouted down the well of her eyes.
Many tongues twisted in their mouths when
she went, leaving behind only   
the smallest tooth of wickedness.

Imagine a child from Virginia or New Hampshire
Alone on the prairie eighty years ago
Or more, one afternoon—the shaggy pelt
Of grasses, for the first time in that child’s life,
Flowing for miles. Imagine the moving shadow
Of a cloud far off across that shadeless ocean,
The obliterating strangeness like a tide
That pulls or empties the bubble of the child’s
Imaginary heart. No hills, no trees. 
The child’s heart lightens, tending like a bubble
Towards the currents of the grass and sky,
The pure potential of the clear blank spaces. 
Or, imagine the child in a draw that holds a garden
Cupped from the limitless motion of the prairie,
Head resting against a pumpkin, in evening sun.
Ground-cherry bushes grow along the furrows,
The fruit red under its papery, moth-shaped sheath.
Grasshoppers tumble among the vines, as large
As dragons in the crumbs of pale dry earth.
The ground is warm to the child’s cheek, and the wind
Is a humming sound in the grass above the draw,
Rippling the shadows of the red-green blades.
The bubble of the child’s heart melts a little,
Because the quiet of that air and earth
Is like the shadow of a peaceful death—
Limitless and potential; a kind of space
Where one dissolves to become a part of something
Entire ... whether of sun and air, or goodness
And knowledge, it does not matter to the child.
Dissolved among the particles of the garden
Or into the motion of the grass and air,
Imagine the child happy to be a thing. 
Imagine, then, that on that same wide prairie
Some people are threshing in the terrible heat
With horses and machines, cutting bands
And shoveling amid the clatter of the threshers,
The chaff in prickly clouds and the naked sun
Burning as if it could set the chaff on fire.
Imagine that the people are Swedes or Germans,
Some of them resting pressed against the strawstacks,
Trying to get the meager shade.
                                                A man,
A tramp, comes laboring across the stubble
Like a mirage against that blank horizon,
Laboring in his torn shoes toward the tall
Mirage-like images of the tilted threshers
Clattering in the heat. Because the Swedes
Or Germans have no beer, or else because
They cannot speak his language properly,
Or for some reason one cannot imagine,
The man climbs up on a thresher and cuts bands
A minute or two, then waves to one of the people,
A young girl or a child, and jumps head-first
Into the sucking mouth of the machine,
Where he is wedged and beat and cut to pieces—
While the people shout and run in the clouds of chaff,
Like lost mirages on the pelt of prairie. 
The obliterating strangeness and the spaces
Are as hard to imagine as the love of death ...
Which is the love of an entire strangeness,
The contagious blankness of a quiet plain.
Imagine that a man, who had seen a prairie,
Should write a poem about a Dark or Shadow
That seemed to be both his, and the prairie’s—as if
The shadow proved that he was not a man,
But something that lived in quiet, like the grass.
Imagine that the man who writes that poem,
Stunned by the loneliness of that wide pelt,
Should prove to himself that he was like a shadow
Or like an animal living in the dark.
In the dark proof he finds in his poem, the man
Might come to think of himself as the very prairie,
The sod itself, not lonely, and immune to death. 
None of this happens precisely as I try
To imagine that it does, in the empty plains,
And yet it happens in the imagination
Of part of the country: not in any place
More than another, on the map, but rather
Like a place, where you and I have never been
And need to try to imagine—place like a prairie
Where immigrants, in the obliterating strangeness,
Thirst for the wide contagion of the shadow
Or prairie—where you and I, with our other ways,
More like the cities or the hills or trees,
Less like the clear blank spaces with their potential,
Are like strangers in a place we must imagine.

Salt is pity, brooms are fury,
The waterclock stands for primordial harmony. 
The spruce forest, which is said to be Like a cathedral
Indicates proliferation of desire. 
The real meaning of the beginning
Will not become clear until later, if ever. 
Things no longer being what they were,
Artifice poses as process,
The voice is tinged with melancholy. 
The teacup, the brass knuckles, and the pearl-handled razor
Resist interpretation 
As if to say
That half the wind is in the mind
And half in the mind of the wind. 
Speaking through the character
Who comes to faith on his deathbed, 
The author makes apology
For saying things he didn’t mean.
Little girl-cousins with ribbons in their hair 
Confuse him with their names and are carried away
By laughter. Thus,  The force of love comes from belief,
Hate is from lack of doubt.

Weasel and the Ponce were having a confab
            under the chinaberry tree,   
in the shade of the dusty old tree—
            pious Weasel, indefatigable Ponce. 
Abroad in the land were pickings to be had,   
            marks beyond measure,
fat aplenty for tooth and hand. Will and cunning   
            are the clean, bright edges 
of a creature in the wild, of a vigorous man,
            so that goodness finds sustenance,   
charity nurture, in quietude, in quietude within.
            The nose will relate to you a world, 
a world entire, from the merest trace of wind—
            the topography of weakness,
gold in a river’s sand. And there they sniffed,   
            sniffed and with hooded eye conspired, 
in the shadows thrown by the dusty old tree.
            Trading knowledge, whetting tools,   
they made ready for their necessary enterprise,
            the fate nature bestowed. All the while 
drinking in each other’s aspect: they found   
            uncommon pleasure there,
did Weasel and his friend, in the other’s smile and guise,   
            as a young girl in flattering light, 
as a darling young girl by her reflection might—
            the two of them, lovely beyond compare   
in the shade of the chinaberry tree.
            Groomed, laved with blandishment, 
almost gilded in the hours afternoon turns to evening   
            and evening, stealthily, to night,
how would they have noticed the rustle in the thicket,   
            felt the heat of its burning eyes?

Two women with
the same claim
came to the feet of
the wise king. Two women,
but only one baby.
The king knew
someone was lying.
What he said was
Let the child be
cut in half; that way
no one will go
empty-handed. He
drew his sword.
Then, of the two
women, one
renounced her share:
this was
the sign, the lesson.
Suppose
you saw your mother
torn between two daughters:
what could you do
to save her but be
willing to destroy
yourself—she would know
who was the rightful child,
the one who couldn’t bear
to divide the mother.

In Aesop’s tales an honest wretch we find, Whose years and comforts equally declined; He in two wives had two domestic ills, For different age they had, and different wills; One plucked his black hairs out, and one his gray, The man for quietness did both obey, Till all his parish saw his head quite bare, And thought he wanted brains as well as hair.                          The Moral      The parties, henpecked William, are thy wives, The hairs they pluck are thy prerogatives; Tories thy person hate, the Whigs thy power, Though much thou yieldest, still they tug for more, Till this poor man and thou alike are shown, He without hair, and thou without a crown.

                    Once upon a today and yesterday and nevermore there were 7 men and women all locked / up in prison cells. Now these 7 men and women were innocent of any crimes; they were in prison because their skins were black. Day after day, the prisoners paced their cells, pining for their freedom. And the non-black jailers would laugh at the prisoners and beat them with sticks and throw their food on the floor. Finally, prisoner #1 said, “I will educate myself and emulate the non-colored people. That is the way to freedom—c’mon, you guys, and follow me.” “Hell, no,” said prisoner #2. “The only way to get free is to pray to my god and he will deliver you like he delivered Daniel from the lion’s den, so unite and follow me.” “Bullshit,” said prisoner #3. “The only way / out is thru this tunnel i’ve been quietly digging, so c’mon, and follow me.” “Uh-uh,” said prisoner #4, “that’s too risky. The only right / way is to follow all the rules and don’t make the non-colored people angry, so c’mon brothers and sisters and unite behind me.”   “Fuck you!” said prisoner #5, “The only way / out is to shoot our way out, if all of you get / together behind me.” “No,” said prisoner #6, “all of you are incorrect; you have not analyzed the political situation by my scientific method and historical meemeejeebee. All we have to do is wait long enough and the bars will bend from their own inner rot. That is the only way.” “Are all of you crazy,” cried prisoner #7. “I’ll get out by myself, by ratting on the rest of you to the non-colored people. That is the way, that is the only way!” “No-no,” they / all cried, “come and follow me. I have the / way, the only way to freedom.” And so they argued, and to this day they are still arguing; and to this day they are still in their prison cells, their stomachs / trembling with fear.

Ink-black, but moving independently
across the black and white parquet of print,
the ant cancels the author out. The page,
translated to itself, bears hair-like legs
disturbing the fine hairs of its fiber.
These are the feet of summer, pillaging meaning,
destroying Alexandria. Sunlight is silence
laying waste all languages, until, thinly,
the fictional dialogue begins again:

If one could have that little head of hers     
  Painted upon a background of pale gold,      Such as the Tuscan’s early art prefers!      
  No shade encroaching on the matchless mould      Of those two lips, which should be opening soft              
  In the pure profile; not as when she laughs,      For that spoils all: but rather as if aloft      
  Yon hyacinth, she loves so, leaned its staff’s      Burthen of honey-coloured buds to kiss      And capture ’twixt the lips apart for this.Then her lithe neck, three fingers might surround,      How it should waver on the pale gold ground,      Up to the fruit-shaped, perfect chin it lifts!      I know, Correggio loves to mass, in rifts      Of heaven, his angel faces, orb on orbBreaking its outline, burning shades absorb:      But these are only massed there, I should think,      
  Waiting to see some wonder momently      
  Grow out, stand full, fade slow against the sky      
  (That’s the pale ground you’d see this sweet face by),
  All heaven, meanwhile, condensed into one eye      Which fears to lose the wonder, should it wink.

Is there a single thing in nature
that can approach in mystery
the absolute uniqueness of any human face, first, then   
its transformation from childhood to old age— 
We are surrounded at every instant   
by sights that ought to strike the sane   
unbenumbed person tongue-tied, mute   
with gratitude and terror. However, 
there may be three sane people on earth   
at any given time: and if
you got the chance to ask them how they do it,   
they would not understand. 
I think they might just stare at you
with the embarrassment of pity. Maybe smile
the way you do when children suddenly reveal a secret   
preoccupation with their origins, careful not to cause them shame, 
on the contrary, to evince the great congratulating pleasure   
one feels in the presence of a superior talent and intelligence;   
or simply as one smiles to greet a friend who’s waking up,
to prove no harm awaits him, you’ve dealt with and banished all harm.

for Larry Levis



So it is here, then, after so long, and after all—
as the light turns in the leaves in the old golden
way of fall,
                   as the small beasts dig to the place
at the roots where survival waits, cowardly crouching
in the dark,
                   as the branches begin to stretch into winter,
freed of their cheerful burden of green, then 
      it comes home, the flea-ridden bitch of desolation,
a thin dog with its ribs exposed like a lesson
in mathematics, in subtraction; it comes home, to find its bowl
empty—then the numberless
things for which to be grateful dissolve
like the steam from a fire just doused with water
on a day of overcast grays, lined
by a cold slanting rain—
                                     it is October, that season when Death
goes public, costumed, when the talking heads
on the TV screen float up smiling at the terrible
news, their skin alight with the same strange glow
fish give off when they have been dead a week or more,
as the gas company adds odor for warning
that the lines may be leaking, the sweet smell of disaster
hanging, invisible, in the air, a moment
before you strike the match— 
it is then, brother, that I think of you, of your Caravaggio,
of the head of Goliath swung by its hair,
wearing the artist’s own weary expression,
exhausted of everything but its desire
for that beautiful David he used to be; and I think
of all the boys walking the streets
each carrying the severed head of the man
he will become—and the way I bear it is
to think of you, grinning, riding high in the cart leaving
the scene, a pair of huge horses hauling the wagon,
a fine mist rising from their damp shoulders,
unconcerned with what hangs, nailed
to the museum walls—luckily
the fall of Icarus has nothing to do with them,
nor the ruined Goliath who fell like a forest,
nor the wretched Salomes with their blood-splattered
platters, nor the huge stone griffins sobbing
at the gates to Valhalla as the litters are carried past ... 
the dark eyes of the horses are opaque with wisdom,
their hoofs strike the pavements with such a musical decision,
the derisive curl of their lips is so like the mysterious
smile on the angel at Chartres, on Kuan Yin, on the dolphin,
as they pull the cart safe through the blizzards
of Main Street, the snow slowly swallowing the signs
though the crossing light beckons—
a soft glowing green like some spectral Eden
in the blank white swirl of the storm. 
The stallion neighs once, sends a warm cloud
of breath into the snow-filled air,
and the mare isn’t scared yet—at least
she’s still pulling. There’s a barn out there
somewhere, as they plow through the light’s
yellow aura of caution, its warm glow
foretelling what hides in the storm:
a stall full of gold, where the soul—
that magician—can wallow
and winter in straw.

With this rain I am satisfied we will be together
in the spring. Seeds of water on my window glass,
transparent sprouts and rootlets. In your backyard
steady rain through the heavy dirt we dug in,
our shovels excavating some history of the tiny garden. 
Our blades cut through the design of a previous digger:
rotting boards, rocks, earthworms big as young snakes;
a tarnished spoon, pink champagne foil from a party;
a palmful of blue feathers from a dead jay. 
We dug and planted. We intend to have a history here
behind this rented house. Despite the owner there is a secret
between us and the ground. In the wet dirt, our fleshy bulbs
and the pink cloves of garlic are making nests of roots.
The fact of the garden has satisfied me all morning:
that we worked side by side, your name round
when I spoke it: that my fingers worked in the dirt like rain,
the ground like a made bed with its mulch of leaves,
orderly, full of possibilities, acts of love
not yet performed.
Now the water’s slap on my window
has made me think of something else, suddenly,
what I don’t want to, the way I wake up in the night,
think I’ve heard a gun shot.
The memory, news story
you told me a week ago: the farmers south,
far south, El Salvador, afraid to go into their fields.
What does their dirt look like? I don’t know.
Instead I see that some thing is being planted:
U.S. soldiers watching as others bury a dead
hand, arm, head, torso.
To be afraid
to put your hand into the dirt. To be afraid to go
look at your ground: that it has been cut like skin,
will bulge out like cut muscle: that on a fair day
there will be subterranean thunder, then a loud, continuous
hiss of blood.
I wish I could see only the flowering
bulbs voluptuous in the spring.
But what is planted is
what comes. In the fall, plant stones: in the winter,
the ground gapes with stones like teeth. 
I hold to the plan we thought of: small: full of
possibilities against despair:
us handing out
sheets of paper, thousands, the list of crimes:
sharp thin papers delving up something in people
in parking lots, shopping malls.
What will come of this?
Perhaps people to stand with us outside the buildings,
to say again: Not in my name. Words adamant as rock,
and actions, here, in the coldest months, before
soldiers move again in the fields to the south.

Everyone forgets that Icarus also flew.
It's the same when love comes to an end,
or the marriage fails and people say
they knew it was a mistake, that everybody
said it would never work. That she was
old enough to know better. But anything
worth doing is worth doing badly.
Like being there by that summer ocean
on the other side of the island while
love was fading out of her, the stars
burning so extravagantly those nights that
anyone could tell you they would never last.
Every morning she was asleep in my bed
like a visitation, the gentleness in her
like antelope standing in the dawn mist.
Each afternoon I watched her coming back
through the hot stony field after swimming,
the sea light behind her and the huge sky
on the other side of that. Listened to her
while we ate lunch. How can they say
the marriage failed? Like the people who
came back from Provence (when it was Provence)
and said it was pretty but the food was greasy.
I believe Icarus was not failing as he fell,
but just coming to the end of his triumph.

Maybe you need to write a poem about grace. 
When everything broken is broken,   
and everything dead is dead,
and the hero has looked into the mirror with complete contempt,
and the heroine has studied her face and its defects
remorselessly, and the pain they thought might,
as a token of their earnestness, release them from themselves
has lost its novelty and not released them,
and they have begun to think, kindly and distantly,
watching the others go about their days—
likes and dislikes, reasons, habits, fears—
that self-love is the one weedy stalk
of every human blossoming, and understood,
therefore, why they had been, all their lives,   
in such a fury to defend it, and that no one—
except some almost inconceivable saint in his pool
of poverty and silence—can escape this violent, automatic
life’s companion ever, maybe then, ordinary light,
faint music under things, a hovering like grace appears. 
As in the story a friend told once about the time   
he tried to kill himself. His girl had left him.
Bees in the heart, then scorpions, maggots, and then ash.   
He climbed onto the jumping girder of the bridge,   
the bay side, a blue, lucid afternoon.
And in the salt air he thought about the word “seafood,”
that there was something faintly ridiculous about it.
No one said “landfood.” He thought it was degrading to the rainbow perch
he’d reeled in gleaming from the cliffs, the black rockbass,   
scales like polished carbon, in beds of kelp
along the coast—and he realized that the reason for the word   
was crabs, or mussels, clams. Otherwise
the restaurants could just put “fish” up on their signs,   
and when he woke—he’d slept for hours, curled up   
on the girder like a child—the sun was going down
and he felt a little better, and afraid. He put on the jacket   
he’d used for a pillow, climbed over the railing   
carefully, and drove home to an empty house. 
There was a pair of her lemon yellow panties
hanging on a doorknob. He studied them. Much-washed.   
A faint russet in the crotch that made him sick   
with rage and grief. He knew more or less
where she was. A flat somewhere on Russian Hill.   
They’d have just finished making love. She’d have tears   
in her eyes and touch his jawbone gratefully. “God,”   
she’d say, “you are so good for me.” Winking lights,   
a foggy view downhill toward the harbor and the bay.   
“You’re sad,” he’d say. “Yes.” “Thinking about Nick?”
“Yes,” she’d say and cry. “I tried so hard,” sobbing now,
“I really tried so hard.” And then he’d hold her for a while—
Guatemalan weavings from his fieldwork on the wall—
and then they’d fuck again, and she would cry some more,   
and go to sleep.
                        And he, he would play that scene
once only, once and a half, and tell himself
that he was going to carry it for a very long time
and that there was nothing he could do
but carry it. He went out onto the porch, and listened   
to the forest in the summer dark, madrone bark
cracking and curling as the cold came up. 
It’s not the story though, not the friend
leaning toward you, saying “And then I realized—,”
which is the part of stories one never quite believes.   
I had the idea that the world’s so full of pain
it must sometimes make a kind of singing.
And that the sequence helps, as much as order helps—
First an ego, and then pain, and then the singing.

Dim vales—and shadowy floods— And cloudy-looking woods, Whose forms we can’t discover For the tears that drip all over: Huge moons there wax and wane— Again—again—again— Every moment of the night— Forever changing places— And they put out the star-light With the breath from their pale faces. About twelve by the moon-dial, One more filmy than the rest (A kind which, upon trial, They have found to be the best) Comes down—still down—and down With its centre on the crown Of a mountain’s eminence, While its wide circumference In easy drapery falls Over hamlets, over halls, Wherever they may be— O’er the strange woods—o’er the sea— Over spirits on the wing— Over every drowsy thing— And buries them up quite In a labyrinth of light— And then, how, deep! —O, deep, Is the passion of their sleep. In the morning they arise, And their moony covering Is soaring in the skies, With the tempests as they toss, Like—almost any thing— Or a yellow Albatross. They use that moon no more For the same end as before, Videlicet, a tent— Which I think extravagant: Its atomies, however, Into a shower dissever, Of which those butterflies Of Earth, who seek the skies, And so come down again (Never-contented things!) Have brought a specimen Upon their quivering wings.

It was Sunday, before dinner.
My uncles were listening to the opera.
O.Z. and I carried my brother in
And laid him on the table.
The women started screaming.
My brother raised up on his side
With dried blood on his hands,
We killed those goddamn Canale brothers
And nobody is ever going to touch us!
The men shut their eyes and danced.
We drank until morning
When everything was quiet.
They wiped their eyes, kissed us goodbye and left.


^^EOP^^

Slowly the women file to where he stands   
Upright in rimless glasses, silver hair,
Dark suit, white collar. Stewards tirelessly   
Persuade them onwards to his voice and hands,   
Within whose warm spring rain of loving care   
Each dwells some twenty seconds. Now, dear child,
What’s wrong,

^^EOP^^

Once you said joking slyly, If I’m killed
I’ll come to haunt your solemn bed,
I’ll stand and glower at the head
And see if my place is empty still, or filled.

Sing now the heavy furniture of the fall,
the journey’s ending. Strong Aeneas bears   
deep on his shoulders all the dark wood chairs   
and tables of destruction. Bruising, blunt,   
they force his feet on up the war-scraped hills   
past raped dead temples. All Achilles kills   
litters the trail of sofa legs with other   
endings of houses. Further up, gods sit   
changing their own upholsteries of deceit,   
ordaining shelves and benches as the goal   
of his dim voyage. Sometimes arrows drawn   
on chair backs point the way they must go on,   
signs that some corridor of destiny
is reserving him a threshold. Aeneas weeps   
at wind or passion, but steadfastly keeps
carrying battered merchandise marked ROME
in one direction, pondering it all.


^^EOP^^

When I wake now it’s below ocherous, saw-ridged
pine beams. Haze streaks all three windows. I look up
at the dog-eared, glossy magazine photo
I’ve taken with me for years. It gets tacked
like a claim to some new wall in the next place—
Bill Russell & Wilt Chamberlain, one on one
the final game of the 1969 NBA championship,
two hard men snapped elbowing & snatching at a basketball
as if it were a moment one of them might stay inside
forever. I was with
my father the night that game played
on a fuzzy color television, in a jammed Fall River bar.
Seagram & beer chasers for hoarse ex-jocks,
smoke rifting the air. A drunk called him “Tiger”
and asked about the year he’d made all-state guard—
point man, ball-hawk, pacer. Something he rarely spoke
of, & almost always with a gruff mix of impatience
and shyness. Each year,
days painting suburban tract houses & fighting
with contractors followed by
night shifts at the fire station
followed by his kids swarming at breakfast
and my mother trying to stay out of his way,
each of the many stone-hard moments between 1941 & 1969—
they made up a city of granite mills
by a slate & blue river. That town was my father’s
life, & still is. If he felt cheated by it,
by its fate for him,
to bear that disappointment, he kept it secret.
That
night, when he stared deep into a drunk’s memory,
he frowned. He said nothing. He twisted on the stool,
and ordered this guy a beer.
Whatever my father & I have in common
is mostly silence. And anger that keeps twisting
back on itself, though not before it ruins,
often, even something simple
as a walk in the dunes at a warm beach.
But what we share too is a love so awkward
that it explains, with unreasoning perfection,
why we still can’t speak
easily to each other, about the past or anything else,
and why I wake this far from the place where I grew up,
while the wall above me claims now
nothing has changed & all is different.

A 29-year-old stewardess fell ... to her
death tonight when she was swept
through an emergency door that sud-
denly sprang open ... The body ...
was found ... three hours after the
accident.                                             
                              —New York Times



The states when they black out and lie there rolling    when they turn
To something transcontinental    move by    drawing moonlight out of the great
One-sided stone hung off the starboard wingtip    some sleeper next to
An engine is groaning for coffee    and there is faintly coming in
Somewhere the vast beast-whistle of space. In the galley with its racks
Of trays    she rummages for a blanket    and moves in her slim tailored
Uniform to pin it over the cry at the top of the door. As though she blew 
The door down with a silent blast from her lungs    frozen    she is black
Out finding herself    with the plane nowhere and her body taken by the throat
The undying cry of the void    falling    living    beginning to be something
That no one has ever been and lived through    screaming without enough air
Still neat    lipsticked    stockinged    girdled by regulation    her hat
Still on    her arms and legs in no world    and yet spaced also strangely
With utter placid rightness on thin air    taking her time    she holds it
In many places    and now, still thousands of feet from her death she seems
To slow    she develops interest    she turns in her maneuverable body 
To watch it. She is hung high up in the overwhelming middle of things in her
Self    in low body-whistling wrapped intensely    in all her dark dance-weight
Coming down from a marvellous leap    with the delaying, dumfounding ease
Of a dream of being drawn    like endless moonlight to the harvest soil
Of a central state of one’s country    with a great gradual warmth coming
Over her    floating    finding more and more breath in what she has been using
For breath    as the levels become more human    seeing clouds placed honestly
Below her left and right    riding slowly toward them    she clasps it all
To her and can hang her hands and feet in it in peculiar ways    and
Her eyes opened wide by wind, can open her mouth as wide    wider and suck
All the heat from the cornfields    can go down on her back with a feeling
Of stupendous pillows stacked under her    and can turn    turn as to someone
In bed    smile, understood in darkness    can go away    slant    slide
Off tumbling    into the emblem of a bird with its wings half-spread
Or whirl madly on herself    in endless gymnastics in the growing warmth
Of wheatfields rising toward the harvest moon.    There is time to live
In superhuman health    seeing mortal unreachable lights far down seeing
An ultimate highway with one late priceless car probing it    arriving
In a square town    and off her starboard arm the glitter of water catches
The moon by its one shaken side    scaled, roaming silver    My God it is good
And evil    lying in one after another of all the positions for love
Making    dancing    sleeping    and now cloud wisps at her no
Raincoat    no matter    all small towns brokenly brighter from inside
Cloud    she walks over them like rain    bursts out to behold a Greyhound
Bus shooting light through its sides    it is the signal to go straight
Down like a glorious diver    then feet first    her skirt stripped beautifully
Up    her face in fear-scented cloths    her legs deliriously bare    then
Arms out    she slow-rolls over    steadies out    waits for something great
To take control of her    trembles near feathers    planes head-down
The quick movements of bird-necks turning her head    gold eyes the insight-
eyesight of owls blazing into the hencoops    a taste for chicken overwhelming
Her    the long-range vision of hawks enlarging all human lights of cars
Freight trains    looped bridges    enlarging the moon racing slowly
Through all the curves of a river    all the darks of the midwest blazing
From above. A rabbit in a bush turns white    the smothering chickens
Huddle    for over them there is still time for something to live
With the streaming half-idea of a long stoop    a hurtling    a fall
That is controlled    that plummets as it wills    turns gravity
Into a new condition, showing its other side like a moon    shining
New Powers    there is still time to live on a breath made of nothing
But the whole night    time for her to remember to arrange her skirt
Like a diagram of a bat    tightly it guides her    she has this flying-skin
Made of garments    and there are also those sky-divers on tv    sailing
In sunlight    smiling under their goggles    swapping batons back and forth
And He who jumped without a chute and was handed one by a diving
Buddy. She looks for her grinning companion    white teeth    nowhere
She is screaming    singing hymns    her thin human wings spread out
From her neat shoulders    the air beast-crooning to her    warbling
And she can no longer behold the huge partial form of the world    now
She is watching her country lose its evoked master shape    watching it lose
And gain    get back its houses and peoples    watching it bring up
Its local lights    single homes    lamps on barn roofs    if she fell
Into water she might live    like a diver    cleaving    perfect    plunge 
Into another    heavy silver    unbreathable    slowing    saving
Element: there is water    there is time to perfect all the fine
Points of diving    feet together    toes pointed    hands shaped right
To insert her into water like a needle    to come out healthily dripping
And be handed a Coca-Cola    there they are    there are the waters
Of life    the moon packed and coiled in a reservoir    so let me begin To plane across the night air of Kansas    opening my eyes superhumanly
Bright    to the damned moon    opening the natural wings of my jacket
By Don Loper    moving like a hunting owl toward the glitter of water

An old man in Concord forgets to go to morning service. He falls asleep, while reading Vergil, and dreams that he is Aeneas at the funeral of Pallas, an Italian prince.



The sun is blue and scarlet on my page,   
And yuck-a, yuck-a, yuck-a, yuck-a, rage   
The yellowhammers mating. Yellow fire   
Blankets the captives dancing on their pyre,
And the scorched lictor screams and drops his rod.   
Trojans are singing to their drunken God,   
Ares. Their helmets catch on fire. Their files   
Clank by the body of my comrade—miles   
Of filings! Now the scythe-wheeled chariot rolls   
Before their lances long as vaulting poles,   
And I stand up and heil the thousand men,   
Who carry Pallas to the bird-priest. Then   
The bird-priest groans, and as his birds foretold,   
I greet the body, lip to lip. I hold
The sword that Dido used. It tries to speak,   
A bird with Dido’s sworded breast. Its beak   
Clangs and ejaculates the Punic word   
I hear the bird-priest chirping like a bird.   
I groan a little. “Who am I, and why?”   
It asks, a boy’s face, though its arrow-eye   
Is working from its socket. “Brother, try,   
O Child of Aphrodite, try to die:
To die is life.” His harlots hang his bed
With feathers of his long-tailed birds. His head   
Is yawning like a person. The plumes blow;   
The beard and eyebrows ruffle. Face of snow,   
You are the flower that country girls have caught,   
A wild bee-pillaged honey-suckle brought   
To the returning bridegroom—the design
Has not yet left it, and the petals shine;   
The earth, its mother, has, at last, no help:   
It is itself. The broken-winded yelp
Of my Phoenician hounds, that fills the brush   
With snapping twigs and flying, cannot flush   
The ghost of Pallas. But I take his pall,   
Stiff with its gold and purple, and recall   
How Dido hugged it to her, while she toiled,   
Laughing—her golden threads, a serpent coiled   
In cypress. Now I lay it like a sheet;
It clinks and settles down upon his feet,
The careless yellow hair that seemed to burn   
Beforehand. Left foot, right foot—as they turn,   
More pyres are rising: armored horses, bronze,   
And gagged Italians, who must file by ones   
Across the bitter river, when my thumb   
Tightens into their wind-pipes. The beaks drum;
Their headman’s cow-horned death’s-head bites its tongue,   
And stiffens, as it eyes the hero slung
Inside his feathered hammock on the crossed   
Staves of the eagles that we winged. Our cost   
Is nothing to the lovers, whoring Mars   
And Venus, father’s lover. Now his car’s   
Plumage is ready, and my marshals fetch   
His squire, Acoctes, white with age, to hitch   
Aethon, the hero’s charger, and its ears   
Prick, and it steps and steps, and stately tears   
Lather its teeth; and then the harlots bring   
The hero’s charms and baton—but the King,   
Vain-glorious Turnus, carried off the rest.   
“I was myself, but Ares thought it best   
The way it happened.” At the end of time,   
He sets his spear, as my descendants climb   
The knees of Father Time, his beard of scalps,
His scythe, the arc of steel that crowns the Alps.   
The elephants of Carthage hold those snows,   
Turms of Numidian horse unsling their bows,   
The flaming turkey-feathered arrows swarm   
Beyond the Alps. “Pallas,” I raise my arm   
And shout, “Brother, eternal health. Farewell   
Forever.” Church is over, and its bell
Frightens the yellowhammers, as I wake
And watch the whitecaps wrinkle up the lake.   
Mother’s great-aunt, who died when I was eight,   
Stands by our parlor sabre. “Boy, it’s late.   
Vergil must keep the Sabbath.” Eighty years!   
It all comes back. My Uncle Charles appears.   
Blue-capped and bird-like. Phillips Brooks and Grant   
Are frowning at his coffin, and my aunt,   
Hearing his colored volunteers parade   
Through Concord, laughs, and tells her English maid   
To clip his yellow nostril hairs, and fold   
His colors on him. . . . It is I. I hold
His sword to keep from falling, for the dust   
On the stuffed birds is breathless, for the bust   
Of young Augustus weighs on Vergil’s shelf:   
It scowls into my glasses at itself.

(for Caroline Ireland)



They were to have been a love gift,
but when she slit the paper funnel,
they both saw they were fake; false flowers
he'd picked in haste from the store's display,
handmade coloured stuff, stiff as crinoline. 
Instantly she thought of women's hands
cutting in grimy light by a sweatshop window;
rough plank tables strewn with cut-out
flower heads: lily, iris, primula, scentless
chrysanthemums, pistils rigged on wire
in crowns of sponge-tipped stamens,
sepals and petals perfect, perfectly
immune to menaces from the garden. 
Why so wrong, so...flattening? Why not instead
symbols of unchanging love?
                                       Yet pretty enough,
she considered, arranging them in a vase
with dry grass and last summer's hydrangeas
whose deadness was still (how to put it?)
alive, or maybe the other side of life.
Two sides, really, of the same thing? 
She laughed a little, such ideas were embarrassing
even when kept to oneself,
but her train of thought
carried her in its private tunnel through supper,
and at bedtime, brushing her teeth,
she happened to look up at the moon.
Its sunlit face was turned, as always, in her direction. The full moon, she couldn't help thinking,
though we see only half of it. 
It was an insight she decided she could
share with him, but when he joined her
and together they lay in the dark,
there seemed no reason to say anything.
The words, in any case, would be wrong,
would escape or disfigure her meaning. Good was the syllable she murmured to him,
fading into sleep. And just for a split second,
teetering on the verge of it, she believed
everything that had to be was understood.

Those who have lived here since before
time are gone while the ones who must
replace them have not yet arrived. 
The streets are wet with a recent
rain yet you continue to count
first minutes and hours then trees 
rocks, windows, mailboxes, streetlights
and pictographs refusing to
rest even for the brief span it 
would take to dry off, change clothes and
reemerge grotesque yet oddly
attractive like Paganini 
whose mother was visited by
a seraph in Genoa not
long before his birth and who is 
thought now to have acquired much of
his technical wizardry as
a result of Marfan’s syndrome 
a quite common anomaly
of the connective tissues which
may well account for the tall and 
angular body, muscular
underdevelopment as well
as the hypermobile joints that 
eventuated on the stage
in a peculiar stance, a
spectacular bowing technique 
and an awesome mastery of
the fingerboard. He would bring his
left hip forward to support his 
body’s weight. His left shoulder, thrust
forward also, would enable
him to rest his left elbow on 
his chest, a buttress against the
stress of forceful bowing along
with debilitating muscle 
fatigue. The looseness of the right
wrist and shoulder gave pliancy
leading to broad acrobatic 
bowing. The ‘spider’ fingers of
his left hand permitted a range
on the fingerboard which many 
attributed to black magic
for Paganini was said to
have signed a pact with Lucifer 
to acquire virtuosity
as a small child. After his death
perhaps due in part to this tale 
in part also to rumours of
gambling and wild debauchery
the Church refused to allow him 
burial on hallowed ground. In   
consequence his body was moved
furtively from place to place 
until after many years and
for reasons still mysterious
the Church finally relented. 
A few paradoxes should be
noted as an afterward. Though
accused of charlatanism he 
was rewarded for his skill like
no one before him. He loved his
violin above all yet once 
he gambled it away at cards.   
He accepted wealth and renown
from his worshipping admirers 
but tripled the admission price
to his concerts in the face of
adverse reviews. While openly 
irreverent of tradition
he still took a princess as his lover
and let nations strike medals in his name.

Ray’s third new car in half as many years.
Full cooler in the trunk, Ray sogging the beer
as I solemnly chauffeur us through the bush
and up the backroads, hardly cowpaths and hub-deep in mud.   
All day the sky lowers, clears, lowers again.
Somewhere in the bush near Saint John
there are uncles, a family, one mysterious brother
who stayed on the land when Ray left for the cities.
One week Ray is crocked. We’ve been through this before.   
Even, as a little girl, hands in my dress, Ah punka, you’s my Debby, come and ki me.   
Then the road ends in a yard full of dogs.
Them’s Indian dogs, Ray says, lookit how they know me.   
And they do seem to know him, like I do. His odor—
rank beef of fierce turtle pulled dripping from Metagoshe,   
and the inflammable mansmell: hair tonic, ashes, alcohol.   
Ray dances an old woman up in his arms.
Fiddles reel in the phonograph and I sink apart
in a corner, start knocking the Blue Ribbons down.   
Four generations of people live here.
No one remembers Raymond Twobears. 
So what. The walls shiver, the old house caulked with mud   
sails back into the middle of Metagoshe.
A three-foot-long snapper is hooked on a fishline,   
so mean that we do not dare wrestle him in
but tow him to shore, heavy as an old engine.
Then somehow Ray pries the beak open and shoves   
down a cherry bomb. Lights the string tongue. 
Headless and clenched in its armor, the snapper
is lugged home in the trunk for tomorrow’s soup.
Ray rolls it beneath a bush in the backyard and goes in   
to sleep his own head off. Tomorrow I find
that the animal has dragged itself off.
I follow torn tracks up a slight hill and over
into a small stream that deepens and widens into a marsh. 
Ray finds his way back through the room into his arms.   
When the phonograph stops, he slumps hard in his hands   
and the boys and their old man fold him into the car
where he curls around his bad heart, hearing how it knocks   
and rattles at the bars of his ribs to break out. 
Somehow we find our way back. Uncle Ray   
sings an old song to the body that pulls him
toward home. The gray fins that his hands have become   
screw their bones in the dashboard. His face   
has the odd, calm patience of a child who has always
let bad wounds alone, or a creature that has lived   
for a long time underwater. And the angels come   
lowering their slings and litters.

The week in August you come home, adult, professional, aloof, we roast and carve the fatted calf —in our case home-grown pig, the chine garlicked and crisped, the applesauce hand-pressed. Hand-pressed the greengage wine.  Nothing is cost-effective here. The peas, the beets, the lettuces hand sown, are raised to stand apart. The electric fence ticks like the slow heart of something we fed and bedded for a year, then killed with kindness’s one bullet and paid Jake Mott to do the butchering.  In winter we lure the birds with suet, thaw lungs and kidneys for the cat. Darlings, it’s all a circle from the ring of wire that keeps the raccoons from the corn to the gouged pine table that we lounge around, distressed before any of you was born.  Benign and dozy from our gluttonies, the candles down to stubs, defenses down, love leaking out unguarded the way juice dribbles from the fence when grounded by grass stalks or a forgotten hoe, how eloquent, how beautiful you seem!  Wearing our gestures, how wise you grow, ballooning to overfill our space, the almost-parents of your parents now. So briefly having you back to measure us is harder than having let you go.

“Dressed to die ... ”
—Dylan Thomas



Sister once of weeds & a dark water that held still
In ditches reflecting the odd,
Abstaining clouds that passed, & kept
Their own counsel, we
Were different, we kept our own counsel.
Outside the tool shed in the noon heat, while our father
Ground some piece of metal
That would finally fit, with grease & an hour of pushing,
The needs of the mysterious Ford tractor,
We argued out, in adolescence,
Whole systems of mathematics, ethics,
And finally agreed that altruism,
Whose long vowel sounded like the pigeons,
Roosting stupidly & about to be shot
In the barn, was impossible
If one was born a Catholic. The Swedish
Lutherans, whom the nuns called
“Statue smashers,” the Japanese on
Neighboring farms, were, we guessed,
A little better off ....
When I was twelve, I used to stare at weeds
Along the road, at the way they kept trembling
Long after a car had passed;
Or at gnats in families hovering over
Some rotting peaches, & wonder why it was
I had been born a human.
Why not a weed, or a gnat?
Why not a horse, or a spider? And why an American?
I did not think that anything could choose me
To be a Larry Levis before there even was
A Larry Levis. It was strange, but not strange enough
To warrant some design.
                                  On the outside,
The barn, with flaking paint, was still off-white.
Inside, it was always dark, all the way up
To the rafters where the pigeons moaned,
I later thought, as if in sexual complaint,
Or sexual abandon; I never found out which.
When I walked in with a 12-gauge & started shooting,
They fell, like gray fruit, at my feet—
Fat, thumping things that grew quieter
When their eyelids, a softer gray, closed,
Part of the way, at least,
And their friends or lovers flew out a kind of skylight
Cut for loading hay.
I don’t know, exactly, what happened then.
Except my sister moved to Switzerland.
My brother got a job
With Colgate-Palmolive.
He was selling soap in Lodi, California.
Later, in his car, & dressed
To die, or live again, forever,
I drove to my own, first wedding.
I smelled the stale boutonniere in my lapel,
A deceased young flower.
I wondered how my brother’s Buick
Could go so fast, &,
Still questioning, or catching, a last time,
An old chill from childhood,
I thought: why me, why her, & knew it wouldn’t last.

The river is famous to the fish. 
The loud voice is famous to silence,   
which knew it would inherit the earth   
before anybody said so.    
The cat sleeping on the fence is famous to the birds   
watching him from the birdhouse.    
The tear is famous, briefly, to the cheek.    
The idea you carry close to your bosom   
is famous to your bosom.    
The boot is famous to the earth,   
more famous than the dress shoe,   
which is famous only to floors. 
The bent photograph is famous to the one who carries it   
and not at all famous to the one who is pictured.    
I want to be famous to shuffling men   
who smile while crossing streets,   
sticky children in grocery lines,   
famous as the one who smiled back. 
I want to be famous in the way a pulley is famous,   
or a buttonhole, not because it did anything spectacular,   
but because it never forgot what it could do.

’Twas in the month of December, and in the year 1883,That a monster whale came to Dundee,Resolved for a few days to sport and play,And devour the small fishes in the silvery Tay.
So the monster whale did sport and playAmong the innocent little fishes in the beautiful Tay,Until he was seen by some men one day,And they resolved to catch him without delay.
When it came to be known a whale was seen in the Tay,Some men began to talk and to say,We must try and catch this monster of a whale,So come on, brave boys, and never say fail.
Then the people together in crowds did run,Resolved to capture the whale and to have some fun!So small boats were launched on the silvery Tay,While the monster of the deep did sport and play.
Oh! it was a most fearful and beautiful sight,To see it lashing the water with its tail all its might,And making the water ascend like a shower of hail,With one lash of its ugly and mighty tail.
Then the water did descend on the men in the boats,Which wet their trousers and also their coats;But it only made them the more determined to catch the whale,But the whale shook at them his tail.
Then the whale began to puff and to blow,While the men and the boats after him did go,Armed well with harpoons for the fray,Which they fired at him without dismay.
And they laughed and grinned just like wild baboons,While they fired at him their sharp harpoons:But when struck with the harpoons he dived below,Which filled his pursuers’ hearts with woe:
Because they guessed they had lost a prize,Which caused the tears to well up in their eyes;And in that their anticipations were only right,Because he sped on to Stonehaven with all his might:
And was first seen by the crew of a Gourdon fishing boat,Which they thought was a big coble upturned afloat;But when they drew near they saw it was a whale,So they resolved to tow it ashore without fail.
So they got a rope from each boat tied round his tail,And landed their burden at Stonehaven without fail;And when the people saw it their voices they did raise,Declaring that the brave fishermen deserved great praise.
And my opinion is that God sent the whale in time of need,No matter what other people may think or what is their creed;I know fishermen in general are often very poor,And God in His goodness sent it to drive poverty from their door.
So Mr John Wood has bought it for two hundred and twenty-six pound,And has brought it to Dundee all safe and all sound;Which measures 40 feet in length from the snout to the tail,So I advise the people far and near to see it without fail.
Then hurrah! for the mighty monster whale,Which has got 17 feet 4 inches from tip to tip of a tail!Which can be seen for a sixpence or a shilling,That is to say, if the people all are willing.

Poet—Enchanting spirit!—at thy votive shrine I lowly bend a simple wreath to twine; O Come from the ideal world and fling Thy airy fingers o’er my rugged string; Sweep the dark chords of thought and give to earth The thrilling song that tells thy heavenly birth—  Fancy—Happiness when from earth she fled       I passed on her heavenward flight— “Take this crown,” the spirit said       “Of heaven’s own golden light— To the sons of sorrow the token give, And bid them follow my steps and live!”—  I took the crown from the snowy hand,       It flashed like a living star; I turned this dark earth to a fairy land       When I hither drive my car; But I placed the crown round my tresses bright, And man only saw its reflected light—  Many a lovely dream I’ve given,       And many a song divine; But never!—oh never—that gift of heaven       Shall mortals temples twine— Hope and love in the circlet glow! ’Tis all too bright for a world of woe—  Poet—Hist—Beautiful spirit!—why silent so soon? My ear drinks each word of thy magical tune; My lyre owns thy touch—and its tremulous strings Vibrate beneath the soft play of thy wings; Resume thy sweet lay, and reveal, ere we part Thy home lovely spirit—and say what thou art?”—  Fancy—The gleam of a star thou cans’t not see— Of an eye ’neath its sleeping lid, The sound of a far off melody       The voice of a stream that’s hid; Such must I still remain to thee A wonder and a mystery!—  I live in the poet’s dream       I flash on the painter’s eye; I dwell in the moon’s pale beam,       In the depths of the star lit sky; I traverse the earth, the air, the main, And bind young hearts in my magic chain—  I float on the fleecy cloud       My voice is in ev’ry breeze; I speak in the tempest loud,       In the sigh of the waving trees— To the sons of earth—in a mystic tone, I tell of a world more bright than their own!—

I Fanny was younger once than she is now,     And prettier of course: I do not mean  To say that there are wrinkles on her brow;     Yet, to be candid, she is past eighteen—  Perhaps past twenty—but the girl is shy  About her age, and Heaven forbid that I   II Should get myself in trouble by revealing     A secret of this sort; I have too long  Loved pretty women with a poet’s feeling,     And when a boy, in day dream and in song,  Have knelt me down and worshipp’d them: alas!  They never thank’d me for’t—but let that pass.   V Her father kept, some fifteen years ago,     A retail dry-good shop in Chatham-street,  And nursed his little earnings, sure though slow,     Till, having muster’d wherewithal to meet  The gaze of the great world, he breathed the air  Of Pearl-street—and "set up" in Hanover-square.   VI Money is power, ’tis said—I never tried;     I’m but a poet—and bank-notes to me  Are curiosities, as closely eyed,     Whene’er I get them, as a stone would be,  Toss’d from the moon on Doctor Mitchill’s table,  Or classic brickbat from the tower of Babel.   VII But he I sing of well has known and felt     That money hath a power and a dominion;  For when in Chatham-street the good man dwelt,     No one would give a sous for his opinion.  And though his neighbours were extremely civil,  Yet, on the whole, they thought him—a poor devil,   VIII A decent kind of person; one whose head     Was not of brains particularly full;  It was not known that he had ever said     Any thing worth repeating—’twas a dull,  Good, honest man—what Paulding’s muse would call  A “cabbage head”—but he excelled them all   IX In that most noble of the sciences,     The art of making money; and he found  The zeal for quizzing him grew less and less,     As he grew richer; till upon the ground  Of Pearl-street, treading proudly in the might  And majesty of wealth, a sudden light   X Flash’d like the midnight lightning on the eyes     Of all who knew him; brilliant traits of mind,  And genius, clear and countless as the dies     Upon the peacock’s plumage; taste refined,  Wisdom and wit, were his—perhaps much more.  ’Twas strange they had not found it out before.   XXV  Dear to the exile is his native land,     In memory’s twilight beauty seen afar:  Dear to the broker is a note of hand,     Collaterally secured—the polar star  Is dear at midnight to the sailor’s eyes,  And dear are Bristed’s volumes at “half price;”  XXVI But dearer far to me each fairy minute     Spent in that fond forgetfulness of grief;  There is an airy web of magic in it,     As in Othello’s pocket-handkerchief,  Veiling the wrinkles on the brow of sorrow,  The gathering gloom to-day, the thunder cloud to-morrow.   XLI  Since that wise pedant, Johnson, was in fashion,     Manners have changed as well as moons; and he  Would fret himself once more into a passion,     Should he return (which heaven forbid!), and see,  How strangely from his standard dictionary,  The meaning of some words is made to vary.   XLII For instance, an undress at present means     The wearing a pelisse, a shawl, or so;  Or any thing you please, in short, that screens     The face, and hides the form from top to toe;  Of power to brave a quizzing-glass, or storm— ’Tis worn in summer, when the weather’s warm.   XLIII  But a full dress is for a winter’s night.     The most genteel is made of "woven air;"  That kind of classic cobweb, soft and light,     Which Lady Morgan’s Ida used to wear.  And ladies, this aërial manner dress'd in,  Look Eve-like, angel-like, and interesting.

Farewell, false love, the oracle of lies, A mortal foe and enemy to rest, An envious boy, from whom all cares arise, A bastard vile, a beast with rage possessed, A way of error, a temple full of treason, In all effects contrary unto reason. 
A poisoned serpent covered all with flowers, Mother of sighs, and murderer of repose, A sea of sorrows whence are drawn such showers As moisture lend to every grief that grows; A school of guile, a net of deep deceit, A gilded hook that holds a poisoned bait. 
A fortress foiled, which reason did defend, A siren song, a fever of the mind, A maze wherein affection finds no end, A raging cloud that runs before the wind, A substance like the shadow of the sun, A goal of grief for which the wisest run. 
A quenchless fire, a nurse of trembling fear, A path that leads to peril and mishap, A true retreat of sorrow and despair, An idle boy that sleeps in pleasure's lap, A deep mistrust of that which certain seems, A hope of that which reason doubtful deems. 
Sith then thy trains my younger years betrayed, And for my faith ingratitude I find; And sith repentance hath my wrongs bewrayed,Whose course was ever contrary to kind: False love, desire, and beauty frail, adieu! Dead is the root whence all these fancies grew.

The first of the undecoded messages read: “Popeye sits in thunder,   
Unthought of. From that shoebox of an apartment,
From livid curtain’s hue, a tangram emerges: a country.”
Meanwhile the Sea Hag was relaxing on a green couch: “How pleasant   
To spend one’s vacation en la casa de Popeye,” she scratched
Her cleft chin’s solitary hair. She remembered spinach 
And was going to ask Wimpy if he had bought any spinach.   
“M’love,” he intercepted, “the plains are decked out in thunder   
Today, and it shall be as you wish.” He scratched
The part of his head under his hat. The apartment
Seemed to grow smaller. “But what if no pleasant
Inspiration plunge us now to the stars? For this is my country.” 
Suddenly they remembered how it was cheaper in the country.   
Wimpy was thoughtfully cutting open a number 2 can of spinach   
When the door opened and Swee’pea crept in. “How pleasant!”
But Swee’pea looked morose. A note was pinned to his bib. “Thunder   
And tears are unavailing,” it read. “Henceforth shall Popeye’s apartment   
Be but remembered space, toxic or salubrious, whole or scratched.” 
Olive came hurtling through the window; its geraniums scratched
Her long thigh. “I have news!” she gasped. “Popeye, forced as you know to flee the country
One musty gusty evening, by the schemes of his wizened, duplicate father, jealous of the apartment
And all that it contains, myself and spinach
In particular, heaves bolts of loving thunder
At his own astonished becoming, rupturing the pleasant 
Arpeggio of our years. No more shall pleasant
Rays of the sun refresh your sense of growing old, nor the scratched   
Tree-trunks and mossy foliage, only immaculate darkness and thunder.”   
She grabbed Swee’pea. “I’m taking the brat to the country.”
“But you can’t do that—he hasn’t even finished his spinach,”   
Urged the Sea Hag, looking fearfully around at the apartment. 
But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment
Succumbed to a strange new hush. “Actually it’s quite pleasant
Here,” thought the Sea Hag. “If this is all we need fear from spinach
Then I don’t mind so much. Perhaps we could invite Alice the Goon over”—she scratched
One dug pensively—“but Wimpy is such a country
Bumpkin, always burping like that.” Minute at first, the thunder 
Soon filled the apartment. It was domestic thunder,   
The color of spinach. Popeye chuckled and scratched
His balls: it sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country.

My father’s farm is an apple blossomer.
He keeps his hills in dandelion carpet
and weaves a lane of lilacs between the rose
and the jack-in-the-pulpits.
His sleek cows ripple in the pastures.
The dog and purple iris
keep watch at the garden’s end. 
His farm is rolling thunder,
a lightning bolt on the horizon.
His crops suck rain from the sky
and swallow the smoldering sun.
His fields are oceans of heat,
where waves of gold
beat the burning shore. 
A red fox
pauses under the birch trees,
a shadow is in the river’s bend.
When the hawk circles the land,
my father’s grainfields whirl beneath it.
Owls gather together to sing in his woods,
and the deer run his golden meadow. 
My father’s farm is an icicle,
a hillside of white powder.
He parts the snowy sea,
and smooths away the valleys.
He cultivates his rows of starlight
and drags the crescent moon
through dark unfurrowed fields.

In Memory of Dennis Turner, 1946-1984



A hook shot kisses the rim and
hangs there, helplessly, but doesn’t drop, 
and for once our gangly starting center   
boxes out his man and times his jump 
perfectly, gathering the orange leather   
from the air like a cherished possession 
and spinning around to throw a strike   
to the outlet who is already shoveling 
an underhand pass toward the other guard   
scissoring past a flat-footed defender 
who looks stunned and nailed to the floor   
in the wrong direction, trying to catch sight 
of a high, gliding dribble and a man   
letting the play develop in front of him 
in slow motion, almost exactly
like a coach’s drawing on the blackboard, 
both forwards racing down the court
the way that forwards should, fanning out 
and filling the lanes in tandem, moving   
together as brothers passing the ball 
between them without a dribble, without   
a single bounce hitting the hardwood 
until the guard finally lunges out   
and commits to the wrong man 
while the power-forward explodes past them   
in a fury, taking the ball into the air 
by himself now and laying it gently   
against the glass for a lay-up, 
but losing his balance in the process,   
inexplicably falling, hitting the floor 
with a wild, headlong motion
for the game he loved like a country 
and swiveling back to see an orange blur   
floating perfectly through the net.

Come October, it’s the lake not the border
that has been redrawn. Thinking
about the event afterwards, I realize how remarkably well-prepared   
the girls are. There don’t seem to be any slouches
among them. Please tell them I say hello and that we’ll need 14   
for the green salad and 14 for the apple tarts between
with some rapid washing in clear water I remember as play
and planning in childhood, preparing until the very last moment   
for a gripping narrative that was itself perpetually given over
to improvisations and asymmetrical collaborations that could run
for days. That makes another 14. It was ”the word“ or “the world” in 1981   
when we undertook to talk about the phrase
“once in a while” once in a while
noting the vagueness then named “a while” and how “once” the phrase   
recurs and therefore means more than once
the “while” is defined. We too are in “a while”   
and when “once” next occurs, if the basic design suits
you, we will need a bit of modestly biographical contextualization   
for November. I’m going to put some thought to something
implausibly contemporary which perhaps isn’t wise
since between then and now no new coincidences have been noted   
just one large color photograph of bespangled cowgirls
herding heavy bulls up the avenue that opens this week carefully   
wearing baby blue boots to take out the garbage
but it never rained. At the end of the month, Halloween should be clear.

Home whose names are produced by motion   
is where people go (one following
the next as she hums to herself or he hums to himself   
at some risk to all) to stay in a family plot   
the tales of which are spinning like blades   
on a pinwheel wafted by my desire to talk to you. Fate   
and desire, chance and intention, from time to time   
converge. Most people want things to be good   
but taking a programmatic approach to getting it
would be despicable and none of it would ever get to you   
except via a raucous garage sale. The owner of the pharmacy
at this very moment is screaming in jubilation   
at a silver toaster, I want it
even if it doesn’t work! Two firemen have broken down   
mid-sentence and gone out to look, you know   
the ones. The purport comes all at once   
at the end in such a way that one is thrown back
to the poem again to carry out the ”again“ that the poem is
about. I’ll get a library card at last and I won’t pay $100 for it
feeling tired but only as tired as one would normally feel at sea level   
after, say, a five hour hike, and it was the same
when it was just getting light—a murky gray
that never brightened. I don’t know you well enough to break   
away from my conversations in order to barge in   
on yours and give the illusion that I often know   
where I’m going or where I want to go with certainty   
of motive to propel the prose
or some version of certainty of my own, not knowing   
where one is going but going anyway. Perhaps the trip
will be purposeless. Destiny is simply a good excuse for experience.   
There are birds chirping, smoke is rising
from kerosene-splattered barbecue briquettes, it is summer   
and now, humiliated (I am so damned naive
sometimes), swinging the hips to the right to avoid the edge   
of the worktable, then to the left to avoid toppling the cactus   
I shout, “Things! Things! Get out of my way!”   
I’ve never lost my capacity for being angry. I feel   
that it is justified, even necessary, though I admit that   
after the first hour my improvisations contribute nothing   
but motion to the composition.

The best words get said frequently—they are like fertile pips.   
Apples fall heavily to the ground and lie in the sun, their scent   
abandoning them as a philosophy which cannot be further perfected. Love
releases playful sensations even from serious things providing a life
to think about. Take R—the only thing
R could credit herself with was having lived
her life and so she not only kept an account of it
but did so not in the privacy of a diary but in the form of letters
—abundant, profligate, indiscrete—that I want to write   
to you so as to note something that I read
this morning: “It’s not that this or that means something
to me but this!—or that!—means something to me.” Musically
R bequeaths herself to posterity as a scholar might
bequeath his or her library blowing twisted veils of rain
past the narrow and curving windows in the last hour that will carry us along
to the time when those who come after us will learn
what we know—a man with a mustache waxed and dyed   
green, a line of tall people and a woman at the door, a committee
of children without scooters but not mournful, a poet with a motive, a pilot
with a flashlight, a sulking but fascinated scholar, and Goethe no doubt
for whom R would have released a flock of red canaries.

Time is filled with beginners. You are right. Now
each of them is working on something
and it matters. The large increments of life must not go by   
unrecognized. That’s why my mother’s own mother-in-law   
was often bawdy. “MEATBALLS!” she would shout   
superbly anticipating site-specific specificity in the future   
of poetry. Will this work? The long moment is addressed
to the material world’s “systems and embodiments” for study   
for sentience and for history. Materiality, after all, is about being   
a geologist or biologist, bread dough rising
while four boys on skateboards attempt to fly,
spinning to a halt micromillimeters before I watch them, my attention riveted
on getting tangled and forgetting the name of the chair, for example   
and the huge young man, he is covered with tattoos
I think. Life is a series of given situations
of which the living have to take note on site
and the storytellers give an account as the wind
tangles the rain or the invaders take over the transmitter. The exchange   
of ideas constitutes a challenge to the lyric ego. And so I am reporting   
that I was wrong. A real storyteller never asks what story one wants   
to hear, not the happy Joel nor the sleepy
Clara nor the dreamy Jane, the seductive Sam, the sullen
Robbie Jones. Nonetheless I have bought a bicycle. I have to remember   
to stop. Thank you. I hope you will enjoy it. A bike that is simply locked   
but freestanding will be immediately stolen. Of course
there can’t be much wrong in helping people get what they want   
but creeps and purveyors of negativity
and cruelty are tucked into every institution
and most corners and though my inclination is to vote
in favor of everyone’s dearest dreams of advancement I disagree   
with the remark that “deathlessness” and “fearlessness” don’t work.   
I think they do. “Deathlessness” immediately invokes the “breathlessness” we thought
we’d half heard in the panting of deathlessness whose dashing   
is life. “Writhing” is self-indulgent however
but the near-rhyme with “writing” is terrific. Don’t change that. Poetry   
can’t be about flight — that would make flight a perching
instead of a flight. When one thing becomes another
the other is free to become something
else. I remember just where
we were sitting
under the influence of the wind
watching a crow
becoming something else in this case
a crow.
The state of milk in jars takes place
and the state of world affairs
can now change. No cereal manufacturer intentionally includes angels
but marshmallow bits may look angelic in a bowl. Who knows? A poem
full of ruptures could be one from which all kinds of things are flying.

My father knows the proper way
The nation should be run;
He tells us children every day
Just what should now be done.
He knows the way to fix the trusts,
He has a simple plan;
But if the furnace needs repairs,
We have to hire a man. 
My father, in a day or two
Could land big thieves in jail;
There’s nothing that he cannot do,
He knows no word like “fail.”
“Our confidence” he would restore,
Of that there is no doubt;
But if there is a chair to mend,
We have to send it out. 
All public questions that arise,
He settles on the spot;
He waits not till the tumult dies,
But grabs it while it’s hot.
In matters of finance he can
Tell Congress what to do;
But, O, he finds it hard to meet
His bills as they fall due. 
It almost makes him sick to read
The things law-makers say;
Why, father’s just the man they need,
He never goes astray.
All wars he’d very quickly end,
As fast as I can write it;
But when a neighbor starts a fuss,
’Tis mother has to fight it. 
In conversation father can
Do many wondrous things;
He’s built upon a wiser plan
Than presidents or kings.
He knows the ins and outs of each
And every deep transaction;
We look to him for theories,
But look to ma for action.

“From a certain point onward there is no longer any turning back. That is the point that must be reached.”
FRANZ KAFKA



Father: 
On these occasions, the feelings surprise,   
Spontaneous as rain, and they compel   
Explicitness, embarrassed eyes——   Son: 
Father, you’re not Polonius, you’re reticent,   
But sure. I can already tell
The unction and falsetto of the sentiment   
Which gratifies the facile mouth, but springs   
From no felt, had, and wholly known things.   Father: 
You must let me tell you what you fear
When you wake up from sleep, still drunk with sleep:   
You are afraid of time and its slow drip,
Like melting ice, like smoke upon the air
In February’s glittering sunny day.
Your guilt is nameless, because its name is time,   
Because its name is death. But you can stop
Time as it dribbles from you, drop by drop.   Son: 
But I thought time was full of promises,   
Even as now, the emotion of going away——   Father: 
That is the first of all its menaces,
The lure of a future different from today;   
All of us always are turning away
To the cinema and Asia. All of us go   
To one indeterminate nothing.   Son:
                                          Must it be so?
I question the sentiment you give to me,
As premature, not to be given, learned alone   
When experience shrinks upon the chilling bone.   
I would be sudden now and rash in joy,
As if I lived forever, the future my toy.
Time is a dancing fire at twenty-one,
Singing and shouting and drinking to the sun,   
Powerful at the wheel of a motor-car,
Not thinking of death which is foreign and far.   Father: 
If time flowed from your will and were a feast   
I would be wrong to question your zest.   
But each age betrays the same weak shape.   
Each moment is dying. You will try to escape   
From melting time and your dissipating soul   
By hiding your head in a warm and dark hole.   
See the evasions which so many don,
To flee the guilt of time they become one,   
That is, the one number among masses,   
The one anonymous in the audience,
The one expressionless in the subway,
In the subway evening among so many faces,   
The one who reads the daily newspaper,   
Separate from actor and act, a member
Of public opinion, never involved.
Integrated in the revery of a fine cigar,   
Fleeing to childhood at the symphony concert,   
Buying sleep at the drugstore, grandeur   
At the band concert, Hawaii
On the screen, and everywhere a specious splendor:   
One, when he is sad, has something to eat,   
An ice cream soda, a toasted sandwich,   
Or has his teeth fixed, but can always retreat   
From the actual pain, and dream of the rich.   
This is what one does, what one becomes   
Because one is afraid to be alone,
Each with his own death in the lonely room.   
But there is a stay. You can stop
Time as it dribbles from you, drop by drop.   Son: 
Now I am afraid. What is there to be known?   Father: 
Guilt, guilt of time, nameless guilt.
Grasp firmly your fear, thus grasping your self,   
Your actual will. Stand in mastery,
Keeping time in you, its terrifying mystery.
Face yourself, constantly go back
To what you were, your own history.
You are always in debt. Do not forget
The dream postponed which would not quickly get   
Pleasure immediate as drink, but takes
The travail of building, patience with means.
See the wart on your face and on your friend’s face,   
On your friend’s face and indeed on your own face.   
The loveliest woman sweats, the animal stains   
The ideal which is with us like the sky ...   Son: 
Because of that, some laugh, and others cry.   Father: 
Do not look past and turn away your face.   
You cannot depart and take another name,   
Nor go to sleep with lies. Always the same,   
Always the same self from the ashes of sleep   
Returns with its memories, always, always,
The phoenix with eight hundred thousand memories!   Son: 
What must I do that is most difficult?   Father: 
You must meet your death face to face,   
You must, like one in an old play,
Decide, once for all, your heart’s place.   
Love, power, and fame stand on an absolute   
Under the formless night and the brilliant day,   
The searching violin, the piercing flute.   
Absolute! Venus and Caesar fade at that edge,   
Hanging from the fiftieth-story ledge,
Or diminished in bed when the nurse presses   
Her sickening unguents and her cold compresses.   
When the news is certain, surpassing fear,
You touch the wound, the priceless, the most dear.   
There in death’s shadow, you comprehend   
The irreducible wish, world without end.   Son: 
I begin to understand the reason for evasion,   
I cannot partake of your difficult vision.   Father: 
Begin to understand the first decision.   
Hamlet is the example; only dying
Did he take up his manhood, the dead’s burden,   
Done with evasion, done with sighing,   
Done with revery.
                           Decide that you are dying   
Because time is in you, ineluctable   
As shadow, named by no syllable.   
Act in that shadow, as if death were now:   
Your own self acts then, then you know.   Son: 
My father has taught me to be serious.   Father: 
Be guilty of yourself in the full looking-glass.

I have not ever seen my father’s grave. 
Not that his judgment eyes
have been forgotten
nor his great hands’ print
on our evening doorknobs
            one half turn each night
            and he would come
            drabbled with the world’s business   
            massive and silent
            as the whole day’s wish   
            ready to redefine
            each of our shapes
but now the evening doorknobs   
wait    and do not recognize us   
as we pass. 
Each week a different woman   
regular as his one quick glass
each evening
pulls up the grass his stillness grows   
calling it weed.
Each week    a different woman   
has my mother’s face
and he
who time has    changeless
must be amazed
who knew and loved
but one. 
My father died in silence   
loving creation
and well-defined response   
he lived    still judgments   
on familiar things
and died    knowing
a January 15th that year me. 
Lest I go into dust
I have not ever seen my father’s grave.

Out of a high meadow where flowers
bloom above cloud, come down;
pursue me with reasons for smiling without malice. 
Bring mimic pride like that of the seedling fir,
surprise in the perfect leg-stems
and queries unstirred by recognition or fear
pooled in the deep eyes. 
Come down by regions where rocks
lift through the hot haze of pain;
down landscapes darkened, crossed
by the rift of death-shock; place print
of a neat hoof on trampled ground
where not one leaf or root
remains unbitten; but come down
always, accompany me to the morass
of the decaying mind. There
we’ll share one rotted stump between us.

As a child I parleyed with animals, stuffed and real.
Making my kitten pilot of a boot, I guided
from one end of a string the dizzy flight and collapse.
I was fearful of people as well as things,
and my faithful toy shepherd with his painted face
sat by me on the bed in the gloom.
I was disdainful of dolls as weak people. 
In the favorite story I told myself my parents
were made over into fair-limbed, brave angels
who smiled into their god’s eyes when summoned.
I was benevolent, afraid to let go of this image
at night because I couldn’t hide deep enough
under the covers to be overlooked by death,
the angel bending over me who had been wronged. 
I read histories of queens, regal and barbarian,
whose leopard’s eyes restrained man or wild beast.
I rambled along tidal rivers and in the marshes
where the green-golden grasses dazzled the sun,
and felt the ache of sea-air in my lungs.
I saw water spume near Atlantic cliffs.
I examined lichen. I saw great light drown darkness. 
Then at thirteen I lay in the bleak bed before sleep
and heard the pleadings and the murderous kisses;
and burned, like a bear his fat, my soul.
I quaked at the sound of my voice whispering, No,
or turned my face to the wall
and wept salt onto my knuckles. 
In the serene light of sun-up, before sparrows
tumbled up from the earth, whispering and singing,
and the exquisite sea and sky mobilized
their heavy, blue currents, I was consoled.
I walked through beauty without knowing why
and told no one, wanting nothing else to touch me
and never to move anyone in any way. 
I hid away from the house and learned the dark
was not a dream but could show the pale gravel
of a real driveway. I saw for the first time
later the new moon and the full moon
in one piece. I no longer feared the night,
night like a bear at ease in his wide habitat.
In the greatness of such space I said, This is me.

I 
The coltish horseplay of the locker room,
Moist with the steam of the tiled shower stalls,   
With shameless blends of civet, musk and sweat,   
Loud with the cap-gun snapping of wet towels   
Under the steel-ribbed cages of bare bulbs,   
In some such setting of thick basement pipes   
And janitorial realities
Boys for the first time frankly eye each other,   
Inspect each others’ bodies at close range,   
And what they see is not so much another   
As a strange, possible version of themselves,   
And all the sparring dance, adrenal life,   
Tense, jubilant nimbleness, is but a vague,   
Busy, unfocused ballet of self-love.   II 
If the heart has its reasons, perhaps the body   
Has its own lumbering sort of carnal spirit,   
Felt in the tingling bruises of collision,   
And known to captains as esprit de corps.
What is this brisk fraternity of timing,   
Pivot and lobbing arc, or indirection,    Mens sana in men’s sauna, in the flush
Of health and toilets, private and corporal glee,   
These fleet caroms, plies and genuflections
Before the salmon-leap, the leaping fountain
All sheathed in glistening light, flexed and alert?   
From the vast echo-chamber of the gym,
Among the stumbled shouts and shrill of whistles,   
The bounced basketball sound of a leather whip.   III 
Think of those barren places where men gather   
To act in the terrible name of rectitude,   
Of acned shame, punk’s pride, muscle or turf,   
The bully’s thin superiority.
Think of the Sturm-Abteilungs Kommandant
Who loves Beethoven and collects Degas,
Or the blond boys in jeans whose narrowed eyes   
Are focussed by some hard and smothered lust,   
Who lounge in a studied mimicry of ease,   
Flick their live butts into the standing weeds,   
And comb their hair in the mirror of cracked windows
Of an abandoned warehouse where they keep   
In darkened readiness for their occasion   
The rope, the chains, handcuffs and gasoline.   IV 
Out in the rippled heat of a neighbor’s field,
In the kilowatts of noon, they’ve got one cornered.   
The bugs are jumping, and the burly youths   
Strip to the waist for the hot work ahead.   
They go to arm themselves at the dry-stone wall,   
Having flung down their wet and salty garments   
At the feet of a young man whose name is Saul.   
He watches sharply these superbly tanned   
Figures with a swimmer’s chest and shoulders,   
A miler’s thighs, with their self-conscious grace,   
And in between their sleek, converging bodies,   
Brilliantly oiled and burnished by the sun,   
He catches a brief glimpse of bloodied hair   
And hears an unintelligible prayer.

“Feel me to do right,” our father said on his deathbed.
We did not quite know—in fact, not at all—what he meant.
His last whisper was spent as through a slot in a wall.
He left us a key, but how did it fit? “Feel me
to do right.” Did it mean that, though he died, he would be felt
through some aperture, or by some unseen instrument
our dad just then had come to know? So, to do right always,
we need but feel his spirit? Or was it merely his apology
for dying? “Feel that I do right in not trying,
as you insist, to stay on your side. There is the wide
gateway and the splendid tower, and you implore me
to wait here, with the worms!” 
Had he defined his terms, and could we discriminate
among his motives, we might have found out how to “do right”
before we died—supposing he felt he suddenly knew
what dying was. “You do wrong because you do not feel
as I do now” was maybe the sense. “Feel me, and emulate
my state, for I am becoming less dense—I am feeling right
for the first time.” And then the vessel burst,
and we were kneeling around an emptiness. 
We cannot feel our father now. His power courses through us,
yes, but he—the chest and cheek, the foot and palm,
the mouth of oracle—is calm. And we still seek
his meaning. “Feel me,” he said, and emphasized that word.
Should we have heard it as a plea for a caress—
a constant caress, since flesh to flesh was all that we
could do right if we would bless him?
The dying must feel the pressure of that question—
lying flat, turning cold from brow to heel—the hot
cowards there above protesting their love, and saying,
“What can we do? Are you all right?” While the wall opens
and the blue night pours through. “What can we do?
We want to do what’s right.” 
“Lie down with me, and hold me, tight. Touch me. Be
with me. Feel with me. Feel me to do right.”

Babies must not eat the coal
And they must not make grimaces,
Nor in party dresses roll
And must never black their faces. 
They must learn that pointing’s rude,
They must sit quite still at table,
And must always eat the food
Put before them—if they’re able. 
If they fall, they must not cry,
Though it’s known how painful this is;
No—there’s always Mother by
Who will comfort them with kisses.

Fie pleasure, fie! thou cloyest me with delight, Thou fill’st my mouth with sweetmeats overmuch; I wallow still in joy both day and night: I deem, I dream, I do, I taste, I touch, No thing but all that smells of perfect bliss; Fie pleasure, fie! I cannot like of this.     To taste (sometimes) a bait of bitter gall, To drink a draught of soür ale (some season) To eat brown bread with homely hands in hall, Doth much increase men’s appetites, by reason, And makes the sweet more sugar’d that ensues, Since minds of men do still seek after news.     The pamper’d horse is seldom seen in breath, Whose manger makes his grace (oftimes) to melt; The crammed fowl comes quickly to his death; Such colds they catch in hottest haps that swelt; And I (much like) in pleasure scawled still, Do fear to starve although I feed my fill.     It might suffice that Love hath built his bower Between my lady’s lively shining eyes; It were enough that beauty’s fading flower Grows ever fresh with her in heavenly wise; It had been well that she were fair of face, And yet not rob all other dames of grace.     To muse in mind, how wise, how fair, how good, How brave, how frank, how courteous, and how true My lady is, doth but inflame my blood With humours such as bid my health adieu; Since hap always when it is clomb on high, Doth fall full low, though erst it reach’d the sky.     Lo, pleasure, lo! lo thus I lead a life That laughs for joy, and trembleth oft for dread; Thy pangs are such as call for change’s knife To cut the twist, or else to stretch the thread, Which holds yfeer the bundle of my bliss: Fie, pleasure, fie! I dare not trust to this.

You sway like a crane to the tunes of tossed stones.
I am what you made to live in
from what you had: hair matted as kelp, bad schools. 
Oh, you will never know me. I wave and you go

boys clap from erasers. I am the pebble
you tossed on the chalked space and war-
danced toward, one-leg two-leg, arms treading air. 
In this, your future, waves rechristen the sea
after its tiny jeweled lives
that hiss “Us Us” to the shore all day.
Where’s the kid called Kateydid? the moonfaced
Kewpiedoll? The excitable pouting
Zookie? The somber O-Be-Joyful? 
Lost girl, playing hopscotch, I will do what you could.
Name of father, son, ghost. Cross my heart and hope.
While the sea’s jewels build shells and shells
change to chalk and chalk to loam and gold
wheat grows where oceans teetered.

for Stephen



A blind girl steps over the red staves
Of a tub. Steam rising from her shoulders and hair,
She walks across a dirt floor to you.
I think you are not her grandfather.
You watch with her a pink man
Who has avoided taxes for two winters—
He is being judged by roosters
And has been chased this far into the countryside. Above him 
Burning sacks of bat dung are arranged
In the purple branches of the thistle trees.
The river is indifferent to him.
And so are we.
You tell your mistress the burning bags of shit
Are like inert buddhas
Dissolving in a field of merit. 
She giggles. A front tooth is loose.
With the river bottom clear as the night air,
The bargeman sings through the hungry vapors
Rising now like white snakes behind him.
You told his wife that Lord Buddha made wasps
From yellow stalks of tobacco with a dark spit. 
Down in the cold bamboo a starving woman
Has opened a small pig—
The old moons climb from its blue glistening stomach,
Or is it light
From the infinitely receding sacks of shit? 
Master, where is the difference?

                    The curtains part: it is a summer’s day. There a cow on a grassy slope watches as a bull charges an old aeroplane in a meadow. The bull is punching holes with its horns in the aeroplane’s fabric...
         Suddenly the aeroplane’s engine ignites; the meadow is dark blue smoke...
         The aeroplane shifts round and faces the charging bull.
         As the bull comes in the propeller takes off the end of its muzzle. The bloody nostrils, a ring through them, are flung to the grass with a shattered blossom of teeth.
         The bull, blood oozing from the stump of its face, backs off, and charges again. This time the propeller catches the bull behind its lower jaw and flings the head into a tree.
         The headless bull backs off once more, and then charges down again. The propeller beating at the headless bull, cutting the body away in a great halo of blood, until only the back legs are standing. These run widely away through the meadow in figure eights and zigzags, until at last they find the aeroplane again. And as they come running down the propeller whacks them apart.
         The legs, one with the tail still attached to it, the other somehow retaining both rectum and testicles, scamper off in opposite directions.
         The aeroplane turns away; the engine stops.
         The shadows are suddenly seen in lengthened form.
         The watching cow begins to low ...

This that is washed with weed and pebblestone
Curved once a dolphin’s length before the prow,
And I who read the land to which we bore
In its grave eyes, question my idol now,
What cold and marvelous fancy it may keep,
Since the salt terror swept us from our course,
Or if a wisdom later than the storm,
For old green ocean’s tinctured it so deep;
And with some reason to me on this strand
The waves, the ceremonial waves have come,
And stooped their barbaric heads, and all flung out
Their glittering arms before them, and are gone,
Leaving the murderous tribute lodged in sand.

Matilde, years or days   
sleeping, feverish,   
here or there,
gazing off,
twisting my spine,   
bleeding true blood,   
perhaps I awaken   
or am lost, sleeping:
hospital beds, foreign windows,
white uniforms of the silent walkers,
the clumsiness of feet. 
And then, these journeys   
and my sea of renewal:   
your head on the pillow,   
your hands floating
in the light, in my light,   
over my earth. 
It was beautiful to live   
when you lived! 
The world is bluer and of the earth   
at night, when I sleep
enormous, within your small hands.

(after Albert Cook)



All day, that
is forever, 
they fall, leaves,
pine needles, 
as blindly as
hours into hours 
colliding,
and the chill 
rain—what else
do you expect 
of October?—
spilling from one 
roof to another,
like words from 
lips to lips, your
long incertain 
say in all of this
unsure of where 
the camera is
and how the light 
is placed and what
it is that’s ending.


^^EOP^^

If they, more petite
   than the mice whose flittings
      have pillaged their robes’ sparkled trim, 
stood tiptoe
   on the plumped felt tops
      of their thimble-sized footstools 
to scrutinize
   the worn fabric
      of this room’s blue distances, 
would they locate
   the source of lightning bolts
      in our faces’ wrinkled pleats 
and construe the stars’
   dance from the tattered
      embroidery of our steps, 
or find in our seamless
   unravelling years
      the tissue of apocalypse?

All the angels of Tie Siding were on fire.
                                                            The famous sky was gone. 
Presumably the mountains were still there, invisible in haze.
                                                                                        OK,
there was only one angel, but she was a torch in the wind, beside
the wind-ripped American flag the post office flies.
                                                                            OK, she wasn't
literally on fire.
                           Maybe her angelic red hair made me think she was
ablaze as it flaunted the prairie and made a festival of itself.
                                                                                        There
was a fireworks stand nearby, entirely beside the point, as was the
Fourth of July.
                     It was really dry.
                                              It was fire season.
                                                                         It was the
wind festival, featuring an angel standing in it, letting her red hair
conflagrate history, reduce it to ash, bid it start anew, erase the sky
with atrocity's own smoke.
                                       She wore, besides her flame of hair,
blue jeans and a singlet.
                                    She was violent in the wind.
                                                                              I started
walking toward her.
                              I'm still walking toward her, no idea what to
say when I get there.

A single seedling, camp follower
         of arson...

Maybe a sin, indecent for sure—dope,
The storekeeper called it. Everyone agreed
That Manuel Lawrence, who drank
Through the side of his mouth, squinting
And chortling with pleasure, was hooked;
Furthermore, Aunt Brenda,
Who was so religious that she made
Her daughters bathe with their panties on,
Had dubbed it “toy likker, fool thing,”
And so might I be, holding the bottle
Out to the light, watching it bristle.
Watching the slow spume of bubbles
Die, I asked myself, could it be alive? 
When they electrocuted Edwin Dockery,
He sat there like a steaming, breathing
Bolt, the green muscles in his arms
Strained at the chair’s black straps,
The little finger of his right hand leapt up,
But the charge rose, the four minutes
And twenty-five hundred volts of his death,
Which in another month will be
Thirty-five years old. So the drink fizzed
With the promise of mixtures to come. 
There it was. If the hard-shell
Baptists of Alabama are good and content
That the monster has died, so am I.
I swallowed. Sweet darkness, one thing
Led to another, the usual life, waking
Sometimes lost, dried blood in the ear,
Police gabbling in a strange language.
How else would I ever gauge
How pleasure might end, walking
Past midnight in the vague direction
Of music. I am never satisfied.

The child’s assignment:
“What is a city?”
All dusk she sucks her pencil
while cars swish by
like ghosts, neighbors’ radios
forecast rain, high clouds,
diminishing winds: at last
she writes: “The city is everyone.”
       Now it’s time
for math, borrowing and exchanging,
the long discipleship
to zero, the stranger,
the force that makes us
what we study: father and child,
writing in separate books,
infinite and alone.

I ne’er was struck before that hour
   With love so sudden and so sweet,
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
   And stole my heart away complete.
My face turned pale as deadly pale,
   My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked, what could I ail?
   My life and all seemed turned to clay. 
And then my blood rushed to my face
   And took my eyesight quite away,
The trees and bushes round the place
   Seemed midnight at noonday.
I could not see a single thing,
   Words from my eyes did start—
They spoke as chords do from the string,
   And blood burnt round my heart. 
Are flowers the winter’s choice?
   Is love’s bed always snow?
She seemed to hear my silent voice,
   Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face
   As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling-place
   And can return no more.


^^EOP^^

I like to touch your tattoos in complete
darkness, when I can’t see them. I’m sure of
where they are, know by heart the neat
lines of lightning pulsing just above
your nipple, can find, as if by instinct, the blue
swirls of water on your shoulder where a serpent
twists, facing a dragon. When I pull you 
to me, taking you until we’re spent
and quiet on the sheets, I love to kiss
the pictures in your skin. They’ll last until
you’re seared to ashes; whatever persists
or turns to pain between us, they will still
be there. Such permanence is terrifying.
So I touch them in the dark; but touch them, trying.


^^EOP^^

First turn to me after a shower,
you come inside me sideways as always 
in the morning you ask me to be on top of you,   
then we take a nap, we’re late for school 
you arrive at night inspired and drunk,   
there is no reason for our clothes 
we take a bath and lie down facing each other,   
then later we turn over, finally you come 
we face each other and talk about childhood
as soon as I touch your penis I wind up coming 
you stop by in the morning to say hello
we sit on the bed indian fashion not touching 
in the middle of the night you come home   
from a nightclub, we don’t get past the bureau 
next day it’s the table, and after that the chair
because I want so much to sit you down & suck your cock 
you ask me to hold your wrists, but then when I   
touch your neck with both my hands you come 
it’s early morning and you decide to very quietly   
come on my knee because of the children 
you’ve been away at school for centuries, your girlfriend   
has left you, you come four times before morning 
you tell me you masturbated in the hotel before you came by   
I don’t believe it, I serve the lentil soup naked 
I massage your feet to seduce you, you are reluctant,   
my feet wind up at your neck and ankles 
you try not to come too quickly   
also, you dont want to have a baby 
I stand up from the bath, you say turn around   
and kiss the backs of my legs and my ass 
you suck my cunt for a thousand years, you are weary   
at last I remember my father’s anger and I come 
you have no patience and come right away
I get revenge and won’t let you sleep all night 
we make out for so long we can’t remember how   
we wound up hitting our heads against the wall 
I lie on my stomach, you put one hand under me   
and one hand over me and that way can love me 
you appear without notice and with flowers   
I fall for it and we become missionaries 
you say you can only fuck me up the ass when you are drunk   
so we try it sober in a room at the farm 
we lie together one night, exhausted couplets
and don’t make love. does this mean we’ve had enough? 
watching t.v. we wonder if each other wants to   
interrupt the plot; later I beg you to read to me 
like the Chinese we count 81 thrusts   
then 9 more out loud till we both come 
I come three times before you do
and then it seems you’re mad and never will 
it’s only fair for a woman to come more   
think of all the times they didn’t care

(January 7, 1915)



In the dregs of the year, all steam and rain,
In the timid time of the heart again,
When indecision is bold and thorough,
And action dreams of a dawn in vain, 
I saw high up over Bloxham vale
The ploughshare tilt to the next long trail,
And, spying a larder in every furrow,
The wagtails crowd like a dancing hail! 
A second wonder there on the hill:
Beneath the hedge, I saw with a thrill
The budding primroses laugh good-morrow
From a deep cradle rocked by a rill! 
Wagtail smart in his belted blue,
Primrose paying her gold ere due,—
(Out upon Winter! Down with Sorrow!)
These are the things that I know are true.

or The Unfortunate Story of the Unmarried Flora Carrillo
And the Man Who Loved Her Before He Died his Famous Death,
From Whose Single Liaison a Daughter Was Born
And the Advice, Rather the Explanation,
Both of Them Left for Her, And the Story Also
Of What She Became, and That She Was Happy  
1.
Three did not count.
A fourth was forgiven by the Father Torres
In exchange for reasonable payment,
Two full days of the Hail Mary.
Bigger than priests, the fifth
Indiscretion was born on a Thursday, early
Evening in a November not too cold.
No rain had fallen
And the birds had not yet gone.
She chose a black dress, this Flora, Florita 
+ here evoke the names of saints + 
Underneath which she carried tonight
An old blade, but of fine Toledo forging
Long as the member of this man
In love with this woman standing at his door.
Her head was filled with the vines of the jungle
The noises of a lion, the feel of ten birds
Trying with their beaks to get out.
All anger: that she had hoped he would
Come to her bedroom. 
And that he had.
Faster than !that she took from him his rolled tongue
Hanging there between his thin legs, his two-fingers,
This girl’s wrist and fist of his
Its central tendon and skin that moved on itself,
This small and second body of his
Which had found its way to her second mouth,
This part of himself which he had given her
Then taken back on this same day, earlier
His ugly afternoon of loving her too much.
He would scream as she had
When she had taken him in first as a leg-bone
And held him there too long, too much
Until he had become a pinky-finger 
+ here evoke the holy names + 
Which she !took now and put in the dowry
She would make for her new daughter.
With it she would write a note,
Nothing else was left to do: Daughter, you will be an only child.
The story of your birth will smell on you.
Do this: take baths filled with rosemary
With leaves, with pinched orange peels.
Keep secret the fact of yourself.
Be happy enough, happy with this much life.
Ask for nothing. Do not live for a long time.

I
         
Cook was a captain of the Admiralty
When sea-captains had the evil eye,
Or should have, what with beating krakens off
And casting nativities of ships;
Cook was a captain of the powder-days
When captains, you might have said, if you had been
Fixed by their glittering stare, half-down the side,
Or gaping at them up companionways,
Were more like warlocks than a humble man—
And men were humble then who gazed at them,
Poor horn-eyed sailors, bullied by devils’ fists
Of wind or water, or the want of both,
Childlike and trusting, filled with eager trust—
Cook was a captain of the sailing days
When sea-captains were kings like this,
Not cold executives of company-rules
Cracking their boilers for a dividend
Or bidding their engineers go wink
At bells and telegraphs, so plates would hold
Another pound. Those captains drove their ships
By their own blood, no laws of schoolbook steam,
Till yards were sprung, and masts went overboard—
Daemons in periwigs, doling magic out,
Who read fair alphabets in stars
Where humbler men found but a mess of sparks,
Who steered their crews by mysteries
And strange, half-dreadful sortilege with books,
Used medicines that only gods could know
The sense of, but sailors drank
In simple faith. That was the captain
Cook was when he came to the Coral Sea
And chose a passage into the dark. 
How many mariners had made that choice
Paused on the brink of mystery! ‘Choose now!’
The winds roared, blowing home, blowing home,
Over the Coral Sea. ‘Choose now!’ the trades
Cried once to Tasman, throwing him for choice
Their teeth or shoulders, and the Dutchman chose
The wind’s way, turning north. ‘Choose, Bougainville!’
The wind cried once, and Bougainville had heard
The voice of God, calling him prudently
Out of the dead lee shore, and chose the north,
The wind’s way. So, too, Cook made choice,
Over the brink, into the devil’s mouth,
With four months’ food, and sailors wild with dreams
Of English beer, the smoking barns of home.
So Cook made choice, so Cook sailed westabout,
So men write poems in Australia.   II 
Flowers turned to stone! Not all the botany
Of Joseph Banks, hung pensive in a porthole,
Could find the Latin for this loveliness,
Could put the Barrier Reef in a glass box
Tagged by the horrid Gorgon squint
Of horticulture. Stone turned to flowers
It seemed—you’d snap a crystal twig,
One petal even of the water-garden,
And have it dying like a cherry-bough.
They’d sailed all day outside a coral hedge,
And half the night. Cook sailed at night,
Let there be reefs a fathom from the keel
And empty charts. The sailors didn’t ask,
Nor Joseph Banks. Who cared? It was the spell
Of Cook that lulled them, bade them turn below,
Kick off their sea-boots, puff themselves to sleep,
Though there were more shoals outside
Than teeth in a shark’s head. Cook snored loudest himself. 
One day, a morning of light airs and calms,
They slid towards a reef that would have knifed
Their boards to mash, and murdered every man.
So close it sucked them, one wave shook their keel,
The next blew past the coral. Three officers,
In gilt and buttons, languidly on deck
Pointed their sextants at the sun. One yawned,
One held a pencil, one put eye to lens:
Three very peaceful English mariners
Taking their sights for longitude.
I’ve never heard
Of sailors aching for the longitude
Of shipwrecks before or since. It was the spell
Of Cook did this, the phylacteries of Cook.
Men who ride broomsticks with a mesmerist
Mock the typhoon. So, too, it was with Cook.   III 
Two chronometers the captain had,
One by Arnold that ran like mad,
One by Kendal in a walnut case,
Poor devoted creature with a hangdog face. 
Arnold always hurried with a crazed click-click
Dancing over Greenwich like a lunatic,
Kendal panted faithfully his watch-dog beat,
Climbing out of Yesterday with sticky little feet. 
Arnold choked with appetite to wolf up time,
Madly round the numerals his hands would climb,
His cogs rushed over and his wheels ran miles,
Dragging Captain Cook to the Sandwich Isles. 
But Kendal dawdled in the tombstoned past,
With a sentimental prejudice to going fast,
And he thought very often of a haberdasher’s door
And a yellow-haired boy who would knock no more. 
All through the night-time, clock talked to clock,
In the captain’s cabin, tock-tock-tock,
One ticked fast and one ticked slow,
And Time went over them a hundred years ago.   IV 
Sometimes the god would fold his wings
And, stone of Caesars turned to flesh,
Talk of the most important things
That serious-minded midshipmen could wish, 
Of plantains, and the lack of rum
Or spearing sea-cows—things like this
That hungry schoolboys, five days dumb,
In jolly-boats are wonted to discuss. 
What midshipman would pause to mourn
The sun that beat about his ears,
Or curse the tide, if he could horn
His fists by tugging on those lumbering oars? 
Let rum-tanned mariners prefer
To hug the weather-side of yards,
‘Cats to catch mice’ before they purr,
Those were the captain’s enigmatic words. 
Here, in this jolly-boat they graced,
Were food and freedom, wind and storm,
While, fowling-piece across his waist,
Cook mapped the coast, with one eye cocked for game.   V 
After the candles had gone out, and those
Who listened had gone out, and a last wave
Of chimney-haloes caked their smoky rings
Like fish-scales on the ceiling, a Yellow Sea
Of swimming circles, the old man,
Old Captain-in-the-Corner, drank his rum
With friendly gestures to four chairs. They stood
Empty, still warm from haunches, with rubbed nails
And leather glazed, like aged serving-men
Feeding a king’s delight, the sticky, drugged
Sweet agony of habitual anecdotes.
But these, his chairs, could bear an old man’s tongue,
Sleep when he slept, be flattering when he woke,
And wink to hear the same eternal name
From lips new-dipped in rum. 
‘Then Captain Cook,
I heard him, told them they could go
If so they chose, but he would get them back,
Dead or alive, he’d have them,’
The old man screeched, half-thinking to hear ‘Cook!
Cook again! Cook! It’s other cooks he’ll need,
Cooks who can bake a dinner out of pence,
That’s what he lives on, talks on, half-a-crown
A day, and sits there full of Cook.
Who’d do your cooking now, I’d like to ask,
If someone didn’t grind her bones away?
But that’s the truth, six children and half-a-crown
A day, and a man gone daft with Cook.’ 
That was his wife,
Elizabeth, a noble wife but brisk,
Who lived in a present full of kitchen-fumes
And had no past. He had not seen her
For seven years, being blind, and that of course
Was why he’d had to strike a deal with chairs,
Not knowing when those who chafed them had gone to sleep
Or stolen away. Darkness and empty chairs,
This was the port that Alexander Home
Had come to with his useless cutlass-wounds
And tales of Cook, and half-a-crown a day—
This was the creek he’d run his timbers to,
Where grateful countrymen repaid his wounds
At half-a-crown a day. Too good, too good,
This eloquent offering of birdcages
To gulls, and Greenwich Hospital to Cook,
Britannia’s mission to the sea-fowl. 
It was not blindness picked his flesh away,
Nor want of sight made penny-blank the eyes
Of Captain Home, but that he lived like this
In one place, and gazed elsewhere. His body moved
In Scotland, but his eyes were dazzle-full
Of skies and water farther round the world—
Air soaked with blue, so thick it dripped like snow
On spice-tree boughs, and water diamond-green,
Beaches wind-glittering with crumbs of gilt,
And birds more scarlet than a duchy’s seal
That had come whistling long ago, and far
Away. His body had gone back,
Here it sat drinking rum in Berwickshire,
But not his eyes—they were left floating there
Half-round the earth, blinking at beaches milked
By suck-mouth tides, foaming with ropes of bubbles
And huge half-moons of surf. Thus it had been
When Cook was carried on a sailor’s back,
Vengeance in a cocked hat, to claim his price,
A prince in barter for a longboat.
And then the trumpery springs of fate—a stone,
A musket-shot, a round of gunpowder,
And puzzled animals, killing they knew not what
Or why, but killing . . . the surge of goatish flanks
Armoured in feathers, like cruel birds:
Wild, childish faces, killing; a moment seen,
Marines with crimson coats and puffs of smoke
Toppling face-down; and a knife of English iron,
Forged aboard ship, that had been changed for pigs,
Given back to Cook between the shoulder-blades.
There he had dropped, and the old floundering sea,
The old, fumbling, witless lover-enemy,
Had taken his breath, last office of salt water. 
Cook died. The body of Alexander Home
Flowed round the world and back again, with eyes
Marooned already, and came to English coasts,
The vague ancestral darknesses of home,
Seeing them faintly through a glass of gold,
Dim fog-shapes, ghosted like the ribs of trees
Against his blazing waters and blue air.
But soon they faded, and there was nothing left,
Only the sugar-cane and the wild granaries
Of sand, and.palm-trees and the flying blood
Of cardinal-birds; and putting out one hand
Tremulously in the direction of the beach,
He felt a chair in Scotland. And sat down.

Ranks of electroplated cubes, dwindling to glitters,
Like the other pasture, the trigonometry of marble,
Death’s candy-bed. Stone caked on stone,
Dry pyramids and racks of iron balls.
Life is observed, a precipitate of pellets,
Or grammarians freeze it into spar,
Their rhomboids, as for instance, the finest crystal
Fixing a snowfall under glass. Gods are laid out
In alabaster, with horny cartilage
And zinc ribs; or systems of ecstasy
Baked into bricks. There is a gallery of sculpture,
Bleached bones of heroes, Gorgon masks of bushrangers;
But the quarries are of more use than this,
Filled with the rolling of huge granite dice,
Ideas and judgments: vivisection, the Baptist Church,
Good men and bad men, polygamy, birth-control . . . 
Frail tinkling rush
Water-hair streaming
Prickles and glitters
Cloudy with bristles
River of thought
Swimming the pebbles—
Undo, loosen your bubbles!

....
O heart, the equal poise of love’s both parts,Big alike with wounds and darts,Live in these conquering leaves; live all the same,And walk through all tongues one triumphant flame;Live here, great heart, and love and die and kill,And bleed and wound, and yield and conquer still.Let this immortal life, where’er it comes,Walk in a crowd of loves and martyrdoms;Let mystic deaths wait on ’t, and wise souls beThe love-slain witnesses of this life of thee.O sweet incendiary! show here thy art,Upon this carcass of a hard cold heart,Let all thy scatter’d shafts of light, that playAmong the leaves of thy large books of day,Combin’d against this breast, at once break inAnd take away from me my self and sin;This gracious robbery shall thy bounty be,And my best fortunes such fair spoils of me.O thou undaunted daughter of desires!By all thy dow’r of lights and fires,By all the eagle in thee, all the dove,By all thy lives and deaths of love,By thy large draughts of intellectual day,And by thy thirsts of love more large than they,By all thy brim-fill’d bowls of fierce desire,By thy last morning’s draught of liquid fire,By the full kingdom of that final kissThat seiz’d thy parting soul and seal’d thee his,By all the heav’ns thou hast in him,Fair sister of the seraphim!By all of him we have in thee,Leave nothing of my self in me:Let me so read thy life that IUnto all life of mine may die.

Boston Common, December 6, 1882 during the Transit of Venus



I love all sights of earth and skies, From flowers that glow to stars that shine; The comet and the penny show, All curious things, above, below, Hold each in turn my wandering eyes: I claim the Christian Pagan’s line, Humani nihil,—even so,— And is not human life divine?  When soft the western breezes blow, And strolling youths meet sauntering maids, I love to watch the stirring trades Beneath the Vallombrosa shades Our much-enduring elms bestow; The vender and his rhetoric’s flow, That lambent stream of liquid lies; The bait he dangles from his line, The gudgeon and his gold-washed prize. I halt before the blazoned sign That bids me linger to admire The drama time can never tire, The little hero of the hunch, With iron arm and soul of fire, And will that works his fierce desire,— Untamed, unscared, unconquered Punch! My ear a pleasing torture finds In tones the withered sibyl grinds,— The dame sans merci’s broken strain, Whom I erewhile, perchance, have known, When Orleans filled the Bourbon throne, A siren singing by the Seine.  But most I love the tube that spies The orbs celestial in their march; That shows the comet as it whisks Its tail across the planets’ disks, As if to blind their blood-shot eyes; Or wheels so close against the sun We tremble at the thought of risks Our little spinning ball may run, To pop like corn that children parch, From summer something overdone, And roll, a cinder, through the skies.  Grudge not to-day the scanty fee To him who farms the firmament, To whom the Milky Way is free; Who holds the wondrous crystal key, The silent Open Sesame That Science to her sons has lent; Who takes his toll, and lifts the bar That shuts the road to sun and star. If Venus only comes to time, (And prophets say she must and shall,) To-day will hear the tinkling chime Of many a ringing silver dime, For him whose optic glass supplies The crowd with astronomic eyes,— The Galileo of the Mall.  Dimly the transit morning broke; The sun seemed doubting what to do, As one who questions how to dress, And takes his doublets from the press, And halts between the old and new. Please Heaven he wear his suit of blue, Or don, at least, his ragged cloak, With rents that show the azure through!  I go the patient crowd to join That round the tube my eyes discern, The last new-comer of the file, And wait, and wait, a weary while, And gape, and stretch, and shrug, and smile, (For each his place must fairly earn, Hindmost and foremost, in his turn,) Till hitching onward, pace by pace, I gain at last the envied place, And pay the white exiguous coin: The sun and I are face to face; He glares at me, I stare at him; And lo! my straining eye has found A little spot that, black and round, Lies near the crimsoned fire-orb’s rim. O blessed, beauteous evening star, Well named for her whom earth adores,— The Lady of the dove-drawn car,— I know thee in thy white simar; But veiled in black, a rayless spot, Blank as a careless scribbler’s blot, Stripped of thy robe of silvery flame,— The stolen robe that Night restores When Day has shut his golden doors,— I see thee, yet I know thee not; And canst thou call thyself the same?  A black, round spot,—and that is all; And such a speck our earth would be If he who looks upon the stars Through the red atmosphere of Mars Could see our little creeping ball Across the disk of crimson crawl As I our sister planet see.  And art thou, then, a world like ours, Flung from the orb that whirled our own A molten pebble from its zone? How must thy burning sands absorb The fire-waves of the blazing orb, Thy chain so short, thy path so near, Thy flame-defying creatures hear The maelstroms of the photosphere! And is thy bosom decked with flowers That steal their bloom from scalding showers? And hast thou cities, domes, and towers, And life, and love that makes it dear, And death that fills thy tribes with fear?  Lost in my dream, my spirit soars Through paths the wandering angels know; My all-pervading thought explores The azure ocean’s lucent shores; I leave my mortal self below, As up the star-lit stairs I climb, And still the widening view reveals In endless rounds the circling wheels That build the horologe of time. New spheres, new suns, new systems gleam; The voice no earth-born echo hears Steals softly on my ravished ears: I hear them “singing as they shine”— A mortal’s voice dissolves my dream: My patient neighbor, next in line, Hints gently there are those who wait. O guardian of the starry gate, What coin shall pay this debt of mine? Too slight thy claim, too small the fee That bids thee turn the potent key The Tuscan’s hand has placed in thine. Forgive my own the small affront, The insult of the proffered dime; Take it, O friend, since this thy wont, But still shall faithful memory be A bankrupt debtor unto thee, And pay thee with a grateful rhyme.

We don’t get any too much light;       It’s pretty noisy, too, at that; The folks next door stay up all night;       There’s but one closet in the flat; The rent we pay is far from low;       Our flat is small and in the rear; But we have looked around, and so       We think we’ll stay another year.  Our dining-room is pretty dark;       Our kitchen’s hot and very small; The “view” we get of Central Park       We really do not get at all. The ceiling cracks and crumbles down       Upon me while I’m working here— But, after combing all the town,       We think we’ll stay another year.  We are not “handy” to the sub;       Our hall-boy service is a joke; Our janitor’s a foreign dub       Who never does a thing but smoke; Our landlord says he will not cut       A cent from rent already dear; And so we sought for better—but       We think we’ll stay another year.


^^EOP^^

We deemed the secret lost, the spirit gone,
Which spake in Greek simplicity of thought,
And in the forms of gods and heroes wrought
Eternal beauty from the sculptured stone,—
A higher charm than modern culture won
With all the wealth of metaphysic lore,
Gifted to analyze, dissect, explore.
A many-colored light flows from one sun;
Art, ’neath its beams, a motley thread has spun;
The prism modifies the perfect day;
But thou hast known such mediums to shun,
And cast once more on life a pure, white ray.
Absorbed in the creations of thy mind,
Forgetting daily self, my truest self I find.


^^EOP^^

Mark but this flea, and mark in this,   
How little that which thou deniest me is;   
It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,
And in this flea our two bloods mingled be;   
Thou know’st that this cannot be said
A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead,
    Yet this enjoys before it woo,
    And pampered swells with one blood made of two,
    And this, alas, is more than we would do. 
Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare,
Where we almost, nay more than married are.   
This flea is you and I, and this
Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is;   
Though parents grudge, and you, w'are met,   
And cloistered in these living walls of jet.
    Though use make you apt to kill me,
    Let not to that, self-murder added be,
    And sacrilege, three sins in killing three. 
Cruel and sudden, hast thou since
Purpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?   
Wherein could this flea guilty be,
Except in that drop which it sucked from thee?   
Yet thou triumph’st, and say'st that thou   
Find’st not thy self, nor me the weaker now;
    ’Tis true; then learn how false, fears be:
    Just so much honor, when thou yield’st to me,
    Will waste, as this flea’s death took life from thee.

We knew the rules and punishments:
three lashes for lack of diligence,
eight for disobeying mother 
or telling lies.... No blood, he’d say, and no remission. Came a day
he started keeping my account, 
as at a store. And came another
he called me to the tannery:
a Sunday, day of settlement. 
I’d paid one-third the owed amount
when he, to my astonishment,
handed the blue-beech switch to me. 
Always, the greatest of my fears
were not his whippings, but his tears,
and he was tearful now. I dared 
not disobey, nor strike him hard.
“I will consider a weak blow
no blow at all, rather a show 
of cowardice,” he said. No blood
and no remission

To the gentlemen from the south   
to the tourists from the north
who write poems about the south   
to the dumb-ass students
I’d like to ask one lousy question
have you ever seen a regatta of flies
sail around a pile of shit
and then come back and picnic on the shit
just once in your life have you heard
flies on shit
because I cut my eye teeth on flies
floating in shit


^^EOP^^

After all, there’s no need
to say anything 
at first. An orange, peeled
and quartered, flares 
like a tulip on a wedgewood plate
Anything can happen. 
Outside the sun
has rolled up her rugs 
and night strewn salt
across the sky. My heart 
is humming a tune
I haven’t heard in years! 
Quiet’s cool flesh—
let’s sniff and eat it. 
There are ways
to make of the moment 
a topiary
so the pleasure’s in 
walking through.

                    To the one who sets a second place at the table anyway.   

To the one at the back of the empty bus.

To the ones who name each piece of stained glass projected on a white wall.

To anyone convinced that a monologue is a conversation with the past.

To the one who loses with the deck he marked.   

To those who are destined to inherit the meek.   

To us.

How fresh, oh Lord, how sweet and clean Are thy returns! even as the flowers in spring;          To which, besides their own demean, The late-past frosts tributes of pleasure bring.                       Grief melts away                       Like snow in May,          As if there were no such cold thing.           Who would have thought my shriveled heart Could have recovered greenness? It was gone          Quite underground; as flowers depart To see their mother-root, when they have blown,                       Where they together                       All the hard weather,          Dead to the world, keep house unknown.           These are thy wonders, Lord of power, Killing and quickening, bringing down to hell          And up to heaven in an hour; Making a chiming of a passing-bell.                       We say amiss                       This or that is:          Thy word is all, if we could spell.           Oh that I once past changing were, Fast in thy Paradise, where no flower can wither!          Many a spring I shoot up fair, Offering at heaven, growing and groaning thither;                       Nor doth my flower                       Want a spring shower,          My sins and I joining together.           But while I grow in a straight line, Still upwards bent, as if heaven were mine own,          Thy anger comes, and I decline: What frost to that? what pole is not the zone                       Where all things burn,                       When thou dost turn,          And the least frown of thine is shown?           And now in age I bud again, After so many deaths I live and write;          I once more smell the dew and rain, And relish versing. Oh, my only light,                       It cannot be                       That I am he          On whom thy tempests fell all night.           These are thy wonders, Lord of love, To make us see we are but flowers that glide;          Which when we once can find and prove, Thou hast a garden for us where to bide;                       Who would be more,                       Swelling through store,          Forfeit their Paradise by their pride.

Where we almost, nay more than married are.
—John Donne



Pearl egg of fly intimates the curve of larva, its spine and claw point. The cellophane shell,
brittle pupa blanket where the almost fly 
lies like a spring. Coiled and tensile, its exertions will tear the sheet. Six black legs flutter
against the dry christening gown, I see his lambent eyes  cloistered in these living walls of jet. 
Small glider, his veined wings are sheer parasols, gauzy skirts that admit the light. The orange
down of his pelvis beneath this architecture, blood is the adhesive 
fastening flight, my sleek aviator presses his sucker feet to my lips. How little
he denies me, the drone in my ear and he swarms my heart if one 
two light steps from the tips of my fingers he bows his head and makes a violin, 
or hovers behind me when I circle the floor, lonely, he rests on shoulder, elbow, to
stare at me with swollen eyes, 
darkling, drop of ink. A currant in the sugar dish, he models in the painted flowers, black eye
of Susan, blunt thorn—he delights in my decadence, 
the slippery floor, tiles, and stairs haunted with illness: my sensual life and his intersect.
He comes on the wing of another spring, in slicks of grey water, the pendant sun. 
to navigate what is unknown to me, patiently, he regards the chrysalis of skin that envelops 
the arched veins. Incurious and constant, he is used to waiting for the modest blush, the rustle of disrobing 
the hush. Of silks unfolding, of gossamer veils drawn as tenderly as breath, from the fluent sea
of one blood made of two, the sweetness of his pestilent kiss.


^^EOP^^

Down milk-bright colonnades
the leper’s bell recedes. 
Shades lowered against the gleaming waste of ice,
I sit back, bathe in lukewarm acquiescence. 
Dutiful, prompt,
strapped, doped, a little drunk, 
squinting at international afternoon
I’ll soon pass GO again. 
And if these colored pencils, nose drops, passport
should plummet with the rest of the huge oval, 
giant time capsule soft for the shark’s maw,
will a notebook ambered back to front with words 
rescue me from oblivion?
Syrup of skittish travelers, fame. I yawn.


^^EOP^^

In a side booth at MacDonald’s before your music class
you go up and down in your seat like an arpeggio
under the poster of the talking hamburger:
two white eyes rolling around in the top bun, the thin
patty of beef imitating the tongue of its animal nature.
You eat merrily. I watch the Oakland mommies,
trying to understand what it means to be “single.” 
* 
Across from us, females of all ages surround the birthday girl.
Her pale lace and insufficient being
can’t keep them out of her circle.
Stripes of yellow and brown all over the place.
The poor in spirit have started to arrive,
the one with thick midwestern braids twisted like thought
on her head; usually she brings her mother.
This week, no mother. She mouths her words anyway
across the table, space-mama, time-mama,
mama who should be there. 
* 
Families in line: imagine all this
translated by the cry of time moving through us,
this place a rubble. The gardens new generations
will plant in this spot, and the food will go on
in another order. This thought cheers me immensely.
That we will be there together, you still seven,
bending over the crops pretending to be royalty,
that the huge woman with one blind eye
and dots like eyes all over her dress
will also be there, eating with pleasure
as she eats now, right up to the tissue paper,
peeling it back like bright exotic petals. 
* 
Last year, on the sun-spilled deck in Marin
we ate grapes with the Russians;
the KGB man fingered them quickly and dutifully,
then, in a sad tone to us
“We must not eat them so fast,
we wait in line so long for these,” he said. 
* 
The sight of food going into a woman’s mouth
made Byron sick. Food is a metaphor for existence.
When Mr. Egotistical Sublime, eating the pasta,
poked one finger into his mouth, he made a sound.
For some, the curve of the bell pepper
seems sensual but it can worry you,
the slightly greasy feel of it. 
* 
The place I went with your father had an apartment to the left, and in the window, twisted like a huge bowtie,
an old print bedspread. One day, when I looked over,
someone was watching us, a young girl.
The waiter had just brought the first thing:
an orange with an avocado sliced up CCCC
in an oil of forceful herbs. I couldn’t eat it.
The girl’s face stood for something
and from it, a little mindless daylight was reflected.
The businessmen at the next table
were getting off on each other and the young chardonnay.
Their briefcases leaned against their ankles.
I watched the young girl’s face because for an instant
I had seen your face there,
unterrified, unhungry, and a little disdainful.
Then the waiter brought the food,
bands of black seared into it like the memory of a cage. 
* 
You smile over your burger, chattering brightly.
So often, at our sunny kitchen table,
hearing the mantra of the refrigerator,
I’ve thought there was nothing I could do but feed you;
and I’ve always loved the way you eat,
you eat selfishly, humming, bending
the french fries to your will, your brown eyes
spotting everything: the tall boy
who has come in with his mother, repressed rage
in espadrilles, and now carries the tray for her.
Oh this is fun, says the mother,
You stand there with mommy’s purse.
And he stands there smiling after her,
holding all the patience in the world.

(SUGGESTED INSCRIPTION PROBABLY NOT SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE)



The hucksters haggle in the mart
The cars and carts go by;
Senates and schools go droning on;
For dead things cannot die. 
A storm stooped on the place of tombs
With bolts to blast and rive;
But these be names of many men
The lightning found alive. 
If usurers rule and rights decay
And visions view once more
Great Carthage like a golden shell
Gape hollow on the shore, 
Still to the last of crumbling time
Upon this stone be read
How many men of England died
To prove they were not dead.

After the clash of elevator gates
And the long sinking, she emerges where,
A slight thing in the morning’s crosstown glare,
She looks up toward the window where he waits,
Then in a fleeting taxi joins the rest
Of the huge traffic bound forever west. 
On such grand scale do lovers say good-bye—
Even this other pair whose high romance
Had only the duration of a dance,
And who, now taking leave with stricken eye,
See each in each a whole new life forgone.
For them, above the darkling clubhouse lawn, 
Bright Perseids flash and crumble; while for these
Who part now on the dock, weighed down by grief
And baggage, yet with something like relief,
It takes three thousand miles of knitting seas
To cancel out their crossing, and unmake
The amorous rough and tumble of their wake. 
We are denied, my love, their fine tristesse
And bittersweet regrets, and cannot share
The frequent vistas of their large despair,
Where love and all are swept to nothingness;
Still, there’s a certain scope in that long love
Which constant spirits are the keepers of, 
And which, though taken to be tame and staid,
Is a wild sostenuto of the heart,
A passion joined to courtesy and art
Which has the quality of something made,
Like a good fiddle, like the rose’s scent,
Like a rose window or the firmament.

Adam’s likeness, Lord, efface,Stamp thy image in its place.Second Adam from above,Reinstate us in thy love.
Let us thee, though lost, regain,Thee, the life, the inner man:O, to all thyself impart,Form’d in each believing heart.

Freely beside me the vineyards are running and unbridled
Remains the sky. Wildfires trade pinecones and one
Donkey bolts uphill
               for a little cloud
St. Heracleitos’s day and something’s up
That even noses can’t diagnose:
Tricks of a shoeless wind snagging the hem
Of Fate’s nightgown and leaving
Us in the open air of capricorns
               exposed
Secretly I go with all the loot in my mind
For a life unbowed from the beginning. No candles no
               chandeliers
Only a gold anemone’s engagement for a diamond
Feeling its way to where? Asking what? Our moon’s half-
               shadow needs
You to console even the graves
Homoethnic or not. The crux is that the scent of earth
Lost even to bloodhounds
With its weeds onions and creeks
Must be restored to its idiom 
So what! A word contains you peasant of night’s green
Efessos! Forefather sulphur phosphorus your fourteenth
               generation
Inside the orange groves gold words
Sharing the scalpel’s chisel
Tents as yet unpitched
                           others midair
Lost poles suddenly grinding. Sermons
Rise from the seafloor of the facing coves
Twin scythes for theater or temple
Fresh valley springs and other curly streams
Of thus and so. If ever wisdom
Planned circles of clover and dog grass
Another world might live just as before
               your fingerprint 
Letters will exist. People will read and grab
History’s tail once more. Just let the vineyards gallop and the sky
               remain
Unbridled as children want it
With roosters and pinecones and blue kites
               flags
On Saint Heracleitos’s day
                                       child’s is the kingdom.

Now you take ol Rufus. He beat drums,
was free and funky under the arms,
fucked white girls, jumped off a bridge
(and thought nothing of the sacrilege),
he copped out—and he was over twenty-one. 
Take Gerald. Sixteen years hadn’t even done
a good job on his voice. He didn’t even know
how to talk tough, or how to hide the glow
of life before he was thrown in as “pigmeat”
for the buzzards to eat. 
Gerald, who had no memory or hope of copper hot lips—
or firm upthrusting thighs
to reinforce his flow,
let tall walls and buzzards change the course
of his river from south to north. 
(No safety in numbers, like back on the block:
two’s aplenty. three? definitely not.
four? “you’re all muslims.”
five? “you were planning a race riot.”
plus, Gerald could never quite win
with his precise speech and innocent grin
the trust and fists of the young black cats.) 
Gerald, sun-kissed ten thousand times on the nose
and cheeks, didn’t stand a chance,
didn’t even know that the loss of his balls
had been plotted years in advance
by wiser and bigger buzzards than those
who now hover above his track
and at night light upon his back.

for Bobbie



Yesterday I wanted to
speak of it, that sense above   
the others to me
important because all 
that I know derives
from what it teaches me.   
Today, what is it that   
is finally so helpless, 
different, despairs of its own   
statement, wants to
turn away, endlessly
to turn away. 
If the moon did not ...
no, if you did not
I wouldn’t either, but   
what would I not 
do, what prevention, what   
thing so quickly stopped.   
That is love yesterday   
or tomorrow, not 
now. Can I eat
what you give me. I
have not earned it. Must   
I think of everything 
as earned. Now love also   
becomes a reward so
remote from me I have
only made it with my mind. 
Here is tedium,
despair, a painful
sense of isolation and   
whimsical if pompous 
self-regard. But that image   
is only of the mind’s
vague structure, vague to me   
because it is my own. 
Love, what do I think
to say. I cannot say it.
What have you become to ask,   
what have I made you into, 
companion, good company,   
crossed legs with skirt, or   
soft body under
the bones of the bed. 
Nothing says anything   
but that which it wishes   
would come true, fears   
what else might happen in 
some other place, some   
other time not this one.   
A voice in my place, an   
echo of that only in yours. 
Let me stumble into
not the confession but   
the obsession I begin with   
now. For you 
also (also)
some time beyond place, or   
place beyond time, no   
mind left to 
say anything at all,
that face gone, now.
Into the company of love   
it all returns.

Compose for Red a proper verse;
Adhere to foot and strict iamb;
Control the burst of angry words
Or they might boil and break the dam.
Or they might boil and overflow
And drench me, drown me, drive me mad.
So swear no oath, so shed no tear,
And sing no song blue Baptist sad.
Evoke no image, stir no flame,
And spin no yarn across the air.
Make empty anglo tea lace words—
Make them dead white and dry bone bare. 
Compose a verse for Malcolm man,
And make it rime and make it prim.
The verse will die—as all men do—
but not the memory of him!
Death might come singing sweet like C,
Or knocking like the old folk say,
The moon and stars may pass away,
But not the anger of that day.

Looking into my daughter’s eyes I read   
Beneath the innocence of morning flesh   
Concealed, hintings of death she does not heed.
Coldest of winds have blown this hair, and mesh
Of seaweed snarled these miniatures of hands;
The night’s slow poison, tolerant and bland,
Has moved her blood. Parched years that I have seen   
That may be hers appear: foul, lingering   
Death in certain war, the slim legs green.   
Or, fed on hate, she relishes the sting   
Of others’ agony; perhaps the cruel   
Bride of a syphilitic or a fool.   
These speculations sour in the sun.   
I have no daughter. I desire none.

I dreamt last night
the fright was over, that
the dust came, and then water,   
and women and men, together   
again, and all was quiet
in the dim moon’s light. 
A paean of such patience—
laughing, laughing at me,   
and the days extend over
the earth’s great cover,
grass, trees, and flower-
ing season, for no clear reason.

You must not wonder, though you think it strange,To see me hold my louring head so low,And that mine eyes take no delight to rangeAbout the gleams which on your face do grow.The mouse which once hath broken out of trapIs seldom ’ticèd with the trustless bait,But lies aloof for fear of more mishap,And feedeth still in doubt of deep deceit.The scorchèd fly, which once hath ’scaped the flame,Will hardly come to play again with fire,Whereby I learn that grievous is the gameWhich follows fancy dazzled by desire:
 So that I wink or else hold down my head,
 Because your blazing eyes my bale have bred.

where is the poetry of resistance,
                     the poetry of honorable defiance
unafraid of lies from career politicians and business men,
not respectful of journalist who write
official speak void of educated thought
without double search or sub surface questions
that war talk demands?
where is the poetry of doubt and suspicion
not in the service of the state, bishops and priests,
not in the service of beautiful people and late night promises,
not in the service of influence, incompetence and academic
         clown talk?

They will soon be down 
To one, but he still will be
For a little while    still will be stopping 
The flakes in the air with a look,
Surrounding himself with the silence
Of whitening snarls. Let him eat
The last red meal of the condemned 
To extinction, tearing the guts 
From an elk. Yet that is not enough
For me. I would have him eat 
The heart, and from it, have an idea
Stream into his gnarling head
That he no longer has a thing
To lose, and so can walk 
Out into the open, in the full 
Pale of the sub-Arctic sun
Where a single spruce tree is dying 
Higher and higher. Let him climb it
With all his meanness and strength.
Lord, we have come to the end
Of this kind of vision of heaven, 
As the sky breaks open 
Its fans around him and shimmers
And into its northern gates he rises 
Snarling    complete    in the joy of a weasel
With an elk’s horned heart in his stomach
Looking straight into the eternal
Blue, where he hauls his kind. I would have it all 
My way: at the top of that tree I place 
The New World’s last eagle
Hunched in mangy feathers    giving 
Up on the theory of flight.
Dear God of the wildness of poetry, let them mate
To the death in the rotten branches,
Let the tree sway and burst into flame 
And mingle them, crackling with feathers, 
In crownfire. Let something come
Of it    something gigantic    legendary 
Rise beyond reason over hills
Of ice    screaming    that it cannot die,
That it has come back, this time
On wings, and will spare no earthly thing: 
That it will hover, made purely of northern 
Lights, at dusk    and fall
On men building roads: will perch 
On the moose’s horn like a falcon
Riding into battle    into holy war against
Screaming railroad crews: will pull
Whole traplines like fibres from the snow 
In the long-jawed night of fur trappers. 
But, small, filthy, unwinged,
You will soon be crouching 
Alone, with maybe some dim racial notion
Of being the last, but none of how much
Your unnoticed going will mean:
How much the timid poem needs 
The mindless explosion of your rage, 
The glutton’s internal fire    the elk’s
Heart in the belly, sprouting wings, 
The pact of the “blind swallowing
Thing,” with himself, to eat
The world, and not to be driven off it
Until it is gone, even if it takes 
Forever. I take you as you are 
And make of you what I will,
Skunk-bear, carcajou, bloodthirsty 
Non-survivor.
                        Lord, let me die    but not die Out.

Talent is what they say
you have after the novel
is published and favorably
reviewed. Beforehand what
you have is a tedious
delusion, a hobby like knitting. 
Work is what you have done
after the play is produced
and the audience claps.
Before that friends keep asking
when you are planning to go
out and get a job. 
Genius is what they know you
had after the third volume
of remarkable poems. Earlier
they accuse you of withdrawing,
ask why you don’t have a baby,
call you a bum. 
The reason people want M.F.A.’s,
take workshops with fancy names
when all you can really
learn is a few techniques,
typing instructions and some-
body else’s mannerisms 
is that every artist lacks
a license to hang on the wall
like your optician, your vet
proving you may be a clumsy sadist
whose fillings fall into the stew
but you’re certified a dentist. 
The real writer is one
who really writes. Talent
is an invention like phlogiston
after the fact of fire.
Work is its own cure. You have to
like it better than being loved.

The harbingers are come. See, see their mark: White is their color, and behold my head. But must they have my brain? Must they dispark Those sparkling notions, which therein were bred?     Must dullness turn me to a clod? Yet have they left me, Thou art still my God.  Good men ye be, to leave me my best room, Ev’n all my heart, and what is lodgèd there:   I pass not, I, what of the rest become, So Thou art still my God be out of fear.     He will be pleasèd with that ditty: And if I please him, I write fine and witty.  Farewell sweet phrases, lovely metaphors. But will ye leave me thus? When ye before Of stews and brothels only knew the doors, Then did I wash you with my tears, and more,     Brought you to church well dressed and clad: My God must have my best, ev’n all I had.  Lovely enchanting language, sugar-cane, Honey of roses, wither wilt thou fly? Hath some fond lover ’ticed thee to thy bane? And wilt thou leave the church and love a sty?          Fie, thou wilt soil thy broidered coat, And hurt thyself, and him that sings the note.  Let foolish lovers, if they will love dung, With canvas, not with arras, clothe their shame: Let folly speak in her own native tongue. True beauty dwells on high: ours is a flame     But borrowed thence to light us thither. Beauty and beauteous words should go together.  Yet if you go, I pass not; take your way: For Thou art still my God is all that ye Perhaps with more embellishment can say. Go, birds of spring: let winter have his fee;     Let a bleak paleness chalk the door, So all within be livelier than before.

The name of the author is the first to go
followed obediently by the title, the plot,
the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novel
which suddenly becomes one you have never read, never even heard of, 
as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbor
decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain,
to a little fishing village where there are no phones. 
Long ago you kissed the names of the nine muses goodbye
and watched the quadratic equation pack its bag,
and even now as you memorize the order of the planets, 
something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps,
the address of an uncle, the capital of Paraguay. 
Whatever it is you are struggling to remember,
it is not poised on the tip of your tongue
or even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen. 
It has floated away down a dark mythological river
whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall 
well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those
who have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle. 
No wonder you rise in the middle of the night
to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war.
No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted   
out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.

Equisetum, horsetail, railway weed
Laid down in the unconscious of the hills;
Three hundred million years still buried 
In this hair-soft surviving growth that kills
Everything in the glorious garden except itself,
That thrives on starvation, and distils 
Black diamonds, the carboniferous shelf —
That was life before our animals,
With trilobite and coelacanth, 
A stratum of compressed time that tells
Truth without language and is the body store
Of fire, heat, night without intervals — 
That becomes people's living only when strange air
Fills out the folded lungs, the inert corpuscles.
Into the mute dark, light crawls once more. 
                              * 
So the hills must be pillaged and cored.
Such history as they hide must be hacked out
Urgent as money, the buried black seams uncovered. 
Rows of stunted houses under the smoke,
Soot black houses pressed back hard against pit
By fog, by smoke, by a cobra hood of smouldering coke 
Swayed from the nest of ovens huddled opposite.
Families, seven or ten to a household,
Growing up, breathing it, becoming it. 
On winter mornings, grey capped men in the cold,
Clatter of boots on tarmac, sharp and empty,
First shift out in thick frost simple as gold 
On the sulphurous roofs, on the stilted gantry,
Crossing to engine house and winding gear —
Helmet, pick, lamp, tin bottle of tea. 
A Nan or Nora slave to each black grate.
Washing on Monday, the water grimed in its well.
Iron and clean on Tuesday, roll out and bake 
Each Wednesday (that sweet bituminous smell
No child who grew up here forgets).
Thursdays, the Union and the Methodist Circle; 
Fishday on Friday (fryday), a queue of kids,
Thin, squabbling by the chippy. Resurfaced quarrels
After pay day — hard drinking and broken heads. 
Wheels within wheels, an England of working Ezekiels.
Between slag-heaps, coke-tarns and black sludgy leavings,
Forges roaring and reddening, hot irons glowing like jewels. 
No more, no more. They've swept up the workings
As if they were never meant to be part of memory.
A once way of being. A dead place. Hard livings 
That won't return, grim tales forgot as soon as told,
Streaming from the roofs in smoke from a lost century —
A veil of breath in which to survive the cold. 
                              * 
When the mine's shut down, habits prolong the story,
Habits and voices, till grandmothers' old ways pass,
And the terraces fold into themselves, so black, ugly 
And unloved that all but the saved (success
Has spared them, the angel of death-by-money) move away.
The town's inhabited by alien, washed up innocents. 
Children and animals, people too poor to stay
Anywhere else, stray, dazed, into this slum of Eden.
the church is without saints or statuary. 
The memorial is a pick, a hammer, a shovel, given
By the men of Harvey Seam and Victoria Seam. May
Their good bones wake in the living seams of Heaven.  He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn.
They are forgotten of the foot that passeth by.

The Chinese concubine feeling has left and the   
sky hovers like the preparation of a revolutionary speech.
You, my long walk with all that expectation   
the sexy lunches, thousands of them,
and then all that religion of eroticism.
Beneath the squeeze on my heart is a stranglehold.
You, like a little Italian porcelain village that’s all over the   
shop window saying admire this image of foreverness. 
The red scarf is factory-made but silky
and it’s what I’d flutter over your face if you were here   
and it would be cheap greasy hypnotism, my own malarkey
and we’d be on the southside, at the boat docks, and
I’d kiss you beside the stretch of a Russian grain ship, its   
hammer and sickle like the sending out of rescue choppers.

The wind blows east, the wind blows west, And the frost falls and the rain: A weary heart went thankful to rest, And must rise to toil again, ’gain, And must rise to toil again.  The wind blows east, the wind blows west, And there comes good luck and bad; The thriftiest man is the cheerfulest; ’Tis a thriftless thing to be sad, sad, ’Tis a thriftless thing to be sad.  The wind blows east, the wind blows west; Ye shall know a tree by its fruit: This world, they say, is worst to the best;— But a dastard has evil to boot, boot, But a dastard has evil to boot.  The wind blows east, the wind blows west; What skills it to mourn or to talk? A journey I have, and far ere I rest; I must bundle my wallets and walk, walk, I must bundle my wallets and walk.  The wind does blow as it lists alway; Canst thou change this world to thy mind? The world will wander its own wise way; I also will wander mine, mine, I also will wander mine.

At a small monastery—or what had been
a monastery—outside Obrégon, we stopped;   
you were suffering the hollow nausea of your first   
pregnancy, sleeping as best you could
through the thousand miles of pines
and rocky fields of northern Mexico, so I went ahead   
through the saddle-colored rooms, past
the broken church and the row of empty sheds,   
where Indian women, according to a sign,
once baked the flat bread called sapatos de Maria,
to a garden in the back, over the parapet of which
I could see the river through some willows: a rinsed   
bed of sand, dry now in winter.
                                                I didn’t want a child,   
and I was tired of closeness, tired
of being kind, so was glad to be alone
a while and lay down under a jacaranda tree,
and watched through leaves the changing pattern
of the sky, which I was tired of too, the scaly, stratospheric   
winter clouds, edged with light, like the tiny waves   
you pointed out, reflected on the bottom of a bridge   
we rowed under in a rented boat, the day you told me   
of the child—I was tired and slept. 
It was nearly evening when I woke, two mestizo women   
hurried talking through the tulip beds, the sky was pale.   
They’d set small plaques among the plants,
naming them, the ornamentals and the fruit. Some,
so the writing said, were descendants
of the cuttings brought from Spain by monks;   
intermingled here—Pinot grape with ocotillo,   
damascena rose—they thrived. I thought of certain   
tenderness, and forbearance, a man might bring
to vines and simple vegetables, cultivated
in memory of his home perhaps, in a foreign place;   
and thought how sometimes what passes on from us   
has little to do with what we hoped, but nonetheless   
carries word of who we were and what we found.
For a moment then, among the arbors and the flower beds,   
I did not feel so distant from this time and place,   
and the edge of my own local fears began to dull.   
I plucked a sprig—a leaf was all—
from a holly bush, and brought it out to you,   
a little stronger in a portion of myself, a little   
reconciled, though I couldn’t know then
that in a month we would lose the child,
and in time you would pass,
like a squandered fortune, from my life.

Fortune hath taken thee away, my love,My life’s soul and my soul’s heaven above;Fortune hath taken thee away, my princess;My only light and my true fancy’s mistress.
Fortune hath taken all away from me,Fortune hath taken all by taking thee.Dead to all joy, I only live to woe,So fortune now becomes my mortal foe.
In vain you eyes, you eyes do waste your tears,In vain you sighs do smoke forth my despairs,In vain you search the earth and heaven above,In vain you search, for fortune rules in love.
Thus now I leave my love in fortune’s hands,Thus now I leave my love in fortune’s bands,And only love the sorrows due to me;Sorrow henceforth it shall my princess be.
I joy in this, that fortune conquers kings;Fortune that rules on earth and earthly thingsHath taken my love in spite of Cupid’s might;So blind a dame did never Cupid right.
With wisdom’s eyes had but blind Cupid seen,Then had my love my love for ever been;But love farewell; though fortune conquer thee,No fortune base shall ever alter me.

Myths of the landscape—
the sun going down in the mouths of the furnaces,
the fires banked and cooling, ticking into dark, here and there the sudden flaring into roses,
then the light across the long factory of the field, the split and rusted castings,
across the low slant tin roofs of the buildings, across fallow and tar and burnt potato ground. . . .
Everything a little still on fire, in sunlight, then smoke, then cinder,
then the milling back to earth, rich earth, the silica of ash.
The times I can taste the iron in the air, the gray wash like exhaust, smell the burn-off,
my eyes begin to tear, and I'm leaning against a wall, short of breath,
my heart as large as my father's, alone in such poverty my body scars the light.
Arable fields, waste and stony places, waysides—
the day he got the job at the Wellbaum and Company Foundry he wept,
and later, in the truck, pulled the plug on a bottle.
In the metallurgy of ore and coal and limestone, in the conversion of the green world to gray,
in the face of the blue-white fires, I remember the fencerow, the white campion,
calyx and coronal scales, the hawthorns, cut to the size of hedge,
the haws so deep in the blood of the season they bled.
The year we were poor enough to dig potatoes we had to drive there,
then wait for the men to leave who let fires go out.
There'd be one good hour of daylight, the rough straight rows running into shade.
We'd work the ground until the sun was a single line.
I can see my father, now cut in half by the horizon, coming toward me, both arms weighted down.
I can see him bending over, gone.
Later, in the summer, I'd have painted the dead rust undulant sides of all the buildings aluminum,
which in the morning threw a glare like water on the garden.

Water: no matter how much, there is still not enough.
Cunning life keeps asking for more and then a drop more.
Our ankles are weighted with lead, we delve under the wave.
We bend to our spades, we survive the force of the gusher. 
Our bodies fountain with sweat in the deeps of the sea,
Our forehead aches and holds like a sunken prow.
We are out of breath, divining the heart of the geyser,
Constellations are bobbing like corks above on the swell. 
Earth is a waterwheel, the buckets go up and go down,
But to keep the whole aqueous architecture standing its ground
We must make a ring with our bodies and dance out a round
On the dreamt eye of water, the dreamt eye of water, the dreamt eye of water. 
Water: no matter how much, there is still not enough.
Come rain, come thunder, come deluged dams washed away,
Our thirst is unquenchable. A cloud in the water’s a siren.
We become two shades, deliquescent, drowning in song. 
My love, under the tall sky of hope
Our love and our love alone
Keeps dowsing for water.
Sinking the well of each other, digging together.
Each one the other’s phantom limb in the sea.

Beards of   water
                      some of them have.
         Others are blowing whistles of   water.
         Faces astonished that constant   water
                  jumps from their mouths.
                   Jaws of lions are snarling   water
through green teeth over chins of moss.

       coils from the S-shaped necks and spills
                        in flat foils from pincered bills.
                            A solemn curly-headed bull
                            puts out a swollen tongue of   water.

                               into a font that never is full.
                   A goddess is driving a chariot through   water.
                         Her reins and whips are tight white   water.
                         Bronze hoofs of horses wrangle with   water.
                              Marble faces half hidden in leaves.
                         Faces whose hair is leaves and grapes
                         of stone are peering from living leaves.
                                       Faces with mossy lips unlocked
                                                               always uttering   water,

                                           always uttered out of their mouths.

for Anselm Hollo



I 
what is most valued,
the cherished things
any moment in Iowa
settles so carelessly
upon you—cat stickers,
a coded signal Home
Orange Juice is trucking by,
some morning or any day
when winter spring summer
and the poem begin again   II 
who was it started laughing?
someone otherwise somber,
the Christmas lariateer
spinning double circles,
dancing through the lasso
at his side, bullwhipping
cigarettes from his lovely
assistant’s scarlet mouth
every hour on the hour
next to the howling Santa Claus   III 
would have thought other-
wise, conceded the point
at first argument; of course
there were mornings, the hills
went on to Cedar Rapids
and Davenport; in its own season
the corn’s pollen stung another
hand; brown rivers paled with ice;
those were the truck washes we had
known before, the spit of gravel
from the humming wheels; the patient
customer of truck stops knows the best
of these returns, hulks them into
the dark of his coffee with rounded
shoulders and extended forearms   IV 
it is the line of force or the vector
that sees us through our ambiguities,
diagram of rivers, path the semi
takes among its various winds, turn
the night makes at a neon sign, EATS,
locus of all points on the lasso’s rim,
itself remembered; somehow each of us
knows the double twist of brittle fiber
that holds the line together, knows
the turns the rain takes, heaves
the long land rests against our feet


^^EOP^^

                    
                    
                    1. Is it true that they dream?
      
      It is true, for the spaces of night surround them with shape and purpose, like a warm hollow below the shoulders, or between the curve of thigh and belly.   
      The land itself can lie like this. Hence our understanding of giants.
      The wind and the grass cry out to the arms of their sleep as the shore cries out, and buries its face in the bruised sea.
      We all have heard barns and fences splintering against the dark with a weight that is more than wood.
      The stars, too, bear witness. We can read their tails and claws as we would read the signs of our own dreams; a knot of sheets, scratches defining the edges of the body, the position of the legs upon waking.
      The cage and the forest are as helpless in the night as a pair of open hands holding rain.

2. Do they dream of the past or of the future?

      Think of the way a woman who wanders the roads could step into an empty farmhouse one afternoon and find a basket of eggs, some unopened letters, the pillowcases embroidered with initials that once were hers.
      Think of her happiness as she sleeps in the daylilies; the air is always heaviest at the start of dusk.
      Cows, for example, find each part of themselves traveling at a different rate of speed. Their bells call back to their burdened hearts the way a sparrow taunts an old hawk.
      As far as the badger and the owl are concerned, the past is a silver trout circling in the ice. Each night he swims through their waking and makes his way back to the moon.
    Clouds file through the dark like prisoners through an endless yard. Deer are made visible by their hunger.
    I could also mention the hopes of common spiders: green thread sailing from an infinite spool, a web, a thin nest, a child dragging a white rope slowly through the sand.

3. Do they dream of this world or of another?

    The prairie lies open like a vacant eye, blind to everything but the wind. From the tall grass the sky is an industrious map that bursts with rivers and cities. A black hawk waltzes against his clumsy wings, the buzzards grow bored with the dead.
    A screendoor flapping idly on an August afternoon or a woman fanning herself in church; this is how the tails of snakes and cats keep time even in sleep.
    There are sudden flashes of light to account for. Alligators, tormented by knots and vines, take these as a sign of grace. Eagles find solace in the far glow of towns, in the small yellow bulb a child keeps by his bed. The lightning that scars the horizon of the meadow is carried in the desperate gaze of foxes.
    Have other skies fallen into this sky? All the evidence seems to say so.
    Conspiracy of air, conspiracy of ice, the silver trout is thirsty for morning, the prairie dog shivers with sweat. Skeletons of gulls lie scattered on the dunes, their beaks still parted by whispering. These are the languages that fall beyond our hearing.
    Imagine the way rain falls around a house at night, invisible to its sleepers. They do not dream of us.

4. How can we learn more?   
      
    This is all we will ever know.

In the shape of a submarine
frost lengthens on a window.
Outside, winter sparrows perch
in rhinoceros-colored trees.
Mare's tails chase whitely
past brick chimneys.
I have seen those lights before,
small rectangular eyes
of far buildings, one church
steeple darkening the blue sky.    
      *
It looks like a stopped grey heart,
if hearts sport such delicate scallops
and trees wear hearts on their sleeves.
Now the first wasp of spring emerges,
its wings a transparency of fish scales,
old isinglass or vein-fretted windows—
wings of the first untranscendent angel
sentenced to death by the god frost.
How can some later spring reclaim this
paper city or repair its walls damaged
in the long drop from the one hundred
and twentieth odd year of a tree?    
      *
The sky wears that color through which
you expect a tornado's black drill.
Only cicadas try the air, a scratching
that cannon could not silence.
Beyond the barn with three siloes
and the wind pump stopped like a tin daisy,
carp lip the surface of reflected sky,
the promised violence.    
      *
I always imagined that place
as an orchard on a mountaintop,
its summer Delicious freckling
to a sunset by Seurat.
But the last time it was fall,
the sere grass bent one way
toward an open gate,
as though a great wind had swept
down stones of the garden walls.
Two posts bent where the orchard
had been, their purpose obscure.
They stood, I think, where flowers
had rivaled deepest
in their colors and scents.

         I
Under the makeshift arbor of leaves
a hot wind blowing smoke and laughter.
Music out of the renegade west,
too harsh and loud, many dark faces
moved among the sweating whites. 
         II
Wandering apart from the others,
I found an old Indian seated alone
on a bench in the flickering shade. 
He was holding a dented bucket;
three crayfish, lifting themselves
from the muddy water, stirred
and scraped against the greasy metal. 
         III
The old man stared from his wrinkled
darkness across the celebration,
unblinking, as one might see
in the hooded sleep of turtles. 
A smile out of the ages of gold
and carbon flashed upon his face
and vanished, called away
by the sound and the glare around him,
by the lost voice of a child
piercing that thronged solitude. 
         IV
The afternoon gathered distance
and depth, divided in the shadows
that broke and moved upon us . . . 
Slowly, too slowly, as if returned
from a long and difficult journey,
the old man lifted his bucket
and walked away into the sunlit crowd.

Only joy, now here you are,Fit to hear and ease my care;Let my whispering voice obtain,Sweet reward for sharpest pain;Take me to thee, and thee to me.No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.  Night hath closed all in her cloak,Twinkling stars love-thoughts provoke:Danger hence good care doth keep,Jealousy itself doth sleep;Take me to thee, and thee to me.No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.  Better place no wit can find,Cupid’s yoke to loose or bind:These sweet flowers on fine bed too,Us in their best language woo;Take me to thee, and thee to me.No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.  This small light the moon bestows,Serves thy beams but to disclose,So to raise my hap more high;Fear not else, none can us spy:Take me to thee, and thee to me.No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.  That you heard was but a mouse,Dumb sleep holdeth all the house;Yet asleep, methinks they say,Young folks, take time while you may:Take me to thee, and thee to me.No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.  Niggard Time threats, if we missThis large offer of our bliss,Long stay ere he grant the same;Sweet then, while each thing doth frame,Take me to thee, and thee to me.No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.  Your fair mother is abed,Candles out, and curtains spread:She thinks you do letters write.Write, but first let me indite:Take me to thee, and thee to me.No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.  Sweet, alas, why strive you thus?Concord better fitteth us:Leave to Mars the force of hands,Your power in your beauty stands;Take me to thee, and thee to me.No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.  Woe to me, and do you swearMe to hate, but I forbear,Cursèd by my destines allThat brought me so high to fall:Soon with my death I will please thee.No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.

At first all you see are the folds
of drapery, high grass close together, swaying
beads you parted as a child, field behind
the house, then river. Sky.
You were told finches lived there, red-
winged, tipsy, upside down their hold
on the reeds, even so
they sang, trilling over and over
your outstretched hands song
poured like seeds from a basket or from
a bowl, water.
                   There was a woman,
young, beautiful—you used to hug her
from behind, closing your hands
over the cry of surprise
she gave out
like perfume. Now here
she is, rising
from the dead
landscape of memory, just this
fragment of her, still   
kneeling.

note: Most of this journal, written on shipboard, seems to have been destroyed, probably by fire. What remains suggests that Mrs. Chandler journeyed to New Orleans without her husband's permission, thus becoming indirectly the cause of her baby's death.



August, 1849                      EN ROUTE FROM NEW YORK TO NEW ORLEANS
                                        ABOARD THE 'GENERAL WAYNE' 
Two weeks aboard the 'General Wayne'

                   Belle seems to recover. At least
                      fretful which indicates improvement.
                   struck by a nervous disorder.
I sleep very little and take no solid food.

Yesterday evening poor little Cookie died.
She was seized suddenly with spasms, poor thing,
and died in an hour. You will accuse me of
                        but it was truly frightful.
                        I have not slept for weeping.
                                 only a dog!

When it is finally ours, this freedom, this liberty, this beautiful
and terrible thing, needful to man as air,   
usable as earth; when it belongs at last to all,   
when it is truly instinct, brain matter, diastole, systole,   
reflex action; when it is finally won; when it is more   
than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians:   
this man, this Douglass, this former slave, this Negro   
beaten to his knees, exiled, visioning a world   
where none is lonely, none hunted, alien,   
this man, superb in love and logic, this man   
shall be remembered. Oh, not with statues’ rhetoric,   
not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone,
but with the lives grown out of his life, the lives   
fleshing his dream of the beautiful, needful thing.

They caught them.
They were sitting at a table in the kitchen.
It was early.
They had on bathrobes.
They were drinking coffee and smiling.
She had one of his cigarillos in her fingers.
She had her legs tucked up under her in the chair.
They saw them through the window.
She thought of them stepping out of a bath
And him wrapping cloth around her.
He thought of her waking up in a small white building,
He thought of stones settling into the ground.
Then they were gone.
Then they came in through the back.
Her cat ran out.
The house was near the road.
She didn’t like the cat going out.
They stayed at the table.
The others were out of breath.
The man and the woman reached across the table.
They were afraid, they smiled.
The others poured themselves the last of the coffee
Burning their tongues.
The man and the woman looked at them.
They didn’t say anything.
The man and the woman moved closer to each other,
The round table between them.
The stove was still on and burned the empty pot.
She started to get up.
One of them shot her.
She leaned over the table like a schoolgirl doing her lessons.
She thought about being beside him, being asleep.
They took her long grey socks
Put them over the barrel of a rifle
And shot him.
He went back in his chair, holding himself.
She told him hers didn’t hurt much,
Like in the fall when everything you touch
Makes a spark.
He thought about her getting up in the dark
Wrapping a quilt around herself
And standing in the doorway.
She asked the men if they shot them again
Not to hurt their faces.
One of them lit him one of his cigarettes.
He thought what it would be like
Being children together.
He was dead before he finished it.
She asked them could she take it out of his mouth.
So it wouldn’t burn his lips.
She reached over and touched his hair.
She thought about him walking through the dark singing.
She died on the table like that,
Smoke coming out of his mouth.

1. 
Someone plays
                     & the breaking mounts.
Raw material for worthy forthcoming;
indecipherable, discrete.
                                       Plays
rhapsodies as the air cools
and vanquishes: nothing sits still, yet.
The land is a result of its use, I explained.
Everything else rested while the kids made a girdle
removed from classical syntax. Shed, and 
something breaks, mounting
the small hill to its vista: I saw
a rope of trees in another country.
I could not say I am lost in the proper way.
The season is huge.
This house is haunted: I planted it.
Where? In the shed, and 
spoiled by attention. You see?
Every bit counts, when the morning displays
the serious ratio of the given stars.
What made us tear the hours into lines?
So things became a burden to shed, and 
astute as a hungry pilgrim
but not brave, not expert.
It is impolite to stare. Is unwise
to plunder the easily forgotten,
easily shed, and   2. 
They drummed and drummed, attached to a vestigial
clamor. The heat splayed; sparklers
ravished the fog. 
Morning tore the dead back to shore;
enemy ships floundered and were forgotten.
Still, nothing was appeased:
the living silhouette drifted into view
like an ephemeral sail promoting ease
between wreckages.
                              Not speaking a word of English
she animated the landscape
with abundance, a chosen self
lively translated into the color of her eyes.
Awkward and luminous, a stilted charm
separating figure from ground, and solving it.
What pushed up toward the abysmal
with such new appraisals, such sure interest?
The mute girl had seen glories
but what had she come to know?
A finite figure in a rainy field.
A naked figure in a pool.
A skipping figure across a bridge.
A lost figure on a city street.
A moaning figure on a huge bed.
A smiling face in a photograph.
All summer, I circled the garden for her sake.  
 
In memory of my sister Jennifer

                    Something needs to be done—like dragging a big black plastic sack through the upstairs rooms, emptying into it each waste basket, the trash of three lives for a week or so. I am careful and slow about it, so that this little chore will banish the big ones. But I leave the bag lying on the floor and I go into my daughter’s bedroom, into the north morning light from her windows, and while this minute she is at school counting or spelling a first useful word I sit down on her unmade bed and I look out the windows at nothing for a while, the unmoving buildings—houses and a church—in the cold street.
       Across it a dark young man is coming slowly down the white sidewalk with a snowshovel over his shoulder. He’s wearing a light coat, there’s a plastic showercap under his dirty navy blue knit hat, and at a house where the walk hasn’t been cleared he climbs the steps and rings the doorbell and stands waiting, squinting sideways at the wind. Then he half wakes and he says a few words I can’t hear to the storm door that doesn’t open, and he nods his head with the kindly farewell that is a habit he wears as disguise, and he goes back down the steps and on to the next house. All of this in pantomime, the way I see it through windows closed against winter and the faint sounds of winter.
       My daughter’s cross-eyed piggy bank is also staring out blankly, and in its belly are four dollar bills that came one at a time from her grandmother and which tomorrow she will pull out of the corked mouthhole. (It’s not like the piggy banks you have to fill before you empty them because to empty them you have to smash them.) Tomorrow she will buy a perfect piece of small furniture for her warm well-lit dollhouse where no one is tired or weak and the wind can’t get in.
       Sitting on her bed, looking out, I didn’t see a bundled-up lame child out of school and even turned out of the house for a while, or a blind woman with burns or a sick bald veteran—people who might have walked past stoop-shouldered with what’s happened and will keep happening to them. So much limping is not from physical pain—the pain is gone now, but the leg’s still crooked. The piggy bank and I see only the able young man whose straight back nobody needs.
       When he finally gets past where I can see him, it feels as if a kind of music has stopped, and it’s more completely quiet than it was, an emptiness more than a stillness, and I get up from the rumpled bed and I smooth the covers, slowly and carefully, and I look around the room for something to pick up or straighten, and I take a wadded dollar bill from my pocket and put it into the pig and I walk out.

The yolk went down my leg
Like a beautiful snail without a shell,
Went down the hill
To the skillet of water, to the nymphflies,
Into the lips of pond minnows,
Down the long belly of the gar – the hellbenders
Having dived and lost, then into
The paw of the lame panther
Who loped back to her lair with it.
As for the white, it stayed with me,
Mark of the beast, birth, and trade.

We sat across the table.

I said yes. 
Food grew cold on the table.

I like to be loved,

Eph. What Friendship is, Ardelia show.Ard. ’Tis to love, as I love you.Eph. This account, so short (tho’ kind)
    Suits not my inquiring mind.
    Therefore farther now repeat:
    What is Friendship when complete?Ard. ’Tis to share all joy and grief;
    ’Tis to lend all due relief
    From the tongue, the heart, the hand;
    ’Tis to mortgage house and land;
    For a friend be sold a slave;
    ’Tis to die upon a grave,
    If a friend therein do lie.Eph. This indeed, tho’ carried high,
    This, tho’ more than e’er was done
    Underneath the rolling sun,
    This has all been said before.
    Can Ardelia say no more?Ard. Words indeed no more can show:
But ’tis to love, as I love you.

1  Come, my Lucasia, since we see
   That Miracles Mens faith do move,By wonder and by prodigy
   To the dull angry world let’s prove
   There’s a Religion in our Love.
  2  For though we were design’d t’ agree,
   That Fate no liberty destroyes,But our Election is as free
   As Angels, who with greedy choice
   Are yet determin’d to their joyes.
  3  Our hearts are doubled by the loss,
   Here Mixture is Addition grown ;We both diffuse, and both ingross :
   And we whose minds are so much one,
   Never, yet ever are alone.
  4  We court our own Captivity
   Than Thrones more great and innocent :’Twere banishment to be set free,
   Since we wear fetters whose intent
   Not Bondage is, but Ornament.
  5  Divided joyes are tedious found,
   And griefs united easier grow :We are our selves but by rebound,
   And all our Titles shuffled so,
   Both Princes, and both Subjects too.
  6  Our Hearts are mutual Victims laid,
   While they (such power in Friendship lies)Are Altars, Priests, and Off’rings made :
   And each Heart which thus kindly dies,
   Grows deathless by the Sacrifice.

Aiee! It is the ceremony of the first blades of winter.
Horticulture, horticulture, the little steam train says puffing up the mountainside.
As if he had never known a home of his own, only ditches.
Three stomps with a stone stump and the colloquium started.
Beggars under the drainpipe, another hand’s cast of the bone dice.
Whatever name the event has, it can be understood as an invitation.
Epilepsy, epilepsy, the little steam train said, descending at evening.
They bowed so low that their wigs tangled and I had to laugh.

Be kind and tender to the Frog,
   And do not call him names,
As ‘Slimy skin,’ or ‘Polly-wog,’
   Or likewise ‘Ugly James,’
Or ‘Gape-a-grin,’ or ‘Toad-gone-wrong,’   
   Or ‘Billy Bandy-knees’:
The Frog is justly sensitive
   To epithets like these.
No animal will more repay
   A treatment kind and fair;
At least so lonely people say
Who keep a frog (and, by the way,   
They are extremely rare).

At dawn, down in the streets, from pavement grills,
Steam rises like the spent breath of the night.
At open windows, curtains stir on sills;
There’s caging drawn across a market’s face;
An empty crane, at its construction site,
Suspends a cable into chasmed space. 
The roof shows other rooftops, their plateaus
Marked with antennas from which lines are tied
And strung with water beads or hung with clothes.
And here and there a pigeon comes to peck
At opaque puddles, its stiff walk supplied
By herky-jerky motions of its neck. 
Downtown, tall buildings surmount a thinning haze.
The newest, the world center of a bank,
Has sides swept upward from a block-broad base,
Obsidian glass, fifty stories tall;
Against it hangs a window-washer’s plank,
An aerie on a frozen waterfall. 
Nearer and eastward, past still-sleeping blocks,
Crews on the waterfront are changing shifts.
Trucks load at warehouses at the foot of docks;
A tug out in the bay, gathering speed,
With a short hollow blast of puffed smoke, lifts
Gulls to a cawing and air-borne stampede. 
It is as if dawn pliantly compels
The city to relax to sounds and shapes,
To its diagonals and parallels:
Long streets with traffic signals blinking red,
Small squares of parks, alleys with fire escapes,
Rooftops above which cloudless day is spread. 
And it’s as if the roofs’ breeze-freshened shelves,
Their level surfaces of gravelled tar
Where glassy fragments glitter, are themselves
A measure of the intermediate worth
Of all the stories to the morning star
And all the stories to the morning earth.

People expected that the evil would finally drain away.
—Aleksander Wat, My Century



Faded and baked here to a tawny grit,
spills of blood and seed from humanity
called from it for its crimes against mute earth
gully in footpaths, dribble down to the sea,
payment now and forever drawn from birth
through flesh’s sunny darkness. Light yeasts in it. 
And if I find the slope to crumbled temples
of that light’s god dragging at me through heat,
shallow degrees of slant up to remnant stone,
then something more than burnt air, or the repeat
of weight known as time, pulls heavily in this zone,
something the bone brings, terrible through simple. 
Phoibos, slayer at distances with shock,
sower of plague and arrower of healing,
tension of bright-dark beyond spanning, love
will not quite cast out evil while revealing
your fissionables. The raven was your dove.
Heavy isotopes hum with crickets in rock.  Neither woman nor man, my driver laughed
when his lights torched writhings down the far shoulder,
cross-dresser in the night beyond Naples, huge,
sinuous, crooning as we shot past. Life seems older
in its variant forms, drawn by the centrifuge
to the rim and swinging, swayed in time’s dream uncalfed. 
For the vast thrower, shafter of quivering force,
sex was filigree in whoever served.
Pythoness, yes, wombed keeper of those coils
in the wet cellar where tongue darted and swerved.
But her own throat when it swelled with voice knew toils
past a man’s strength, torqued bulging from the source. 
And that young man fitted with bone and thong
and membrane from his withers by his father
the maze molder, when he climbed into flame
itself in the high nucleus, dripped as slather
down the sky’s maw. Union there, with an aim
at the center, crisped on a central soundless gong, 
sizzling from his overreach extended
back on itself and down, the soundless hurry
of the sea far below minutely riven,
trembling in place, diamonds in blue slurry
nowhere disturbed yet flecking everywhere, driven—
all this boy’s cry endlessly thin, suspended. 
The sybil when at last her throat disgorged
its burdens rumbled like a pawing bull,
or the bull-fiend on Krete, and shrilly warbled.
Birds ride the bull’s hump in stone graphs, that full
barbarity at poise piercing now the garbled
clang of Ikaros, over us tensile and forged. 
This is the crumbling whistle of shells and frags
in their close arc. Philosophy gets precise
when it turns practical. This in our background whir.
Archimedes, old Fermi in your eyes,
naked, ecstatic with theorems that assure
conclusion, your city falls, your hacked flesh sags. 
There was a sprig which, if you bore it in hand
on landing here, your pilot drowned and your herald
crushed in the surf, would bend and seem to listen—
there was a branch that trailed her voice through imperiled
corridors to throats of the dead, and glistened,
then brought you back to your breath near shining sand. 
And there was pelt from the solar scavenger,
its blond mane tossing with your workings, turning
catastrophe to triumph, lion crud
strewn now on waves, coat of the charger burning
obsidian cobalt platinum and mud
in craters of the shaker and avenger. 
Eroded skull of this squat promontory,
nubbled shrine over cave by surf hypnotized
before deeps enameled with fire’s mosaic,
you are the structure lucid though pulverized
behind the logics, and the omens prosaic
in their spelling out, and the blaze of story. 
Give me your light! I am the darkened thing
seeking it. Give me your fire and your cry!
But hood me from sulfurs she inhaled when she twisted
over the fissure, give me your hand from the sky
we have fallen into. Give, yes, what you insisted
she utter, rasped uncoilings of your spring! 
And then release me to the animal
shy of speech yet steady in ecstasies,
your cousin the outsider’s gaze through life,
the drink of it down, and finally mind as frieze
eternally in metamorphic strife
released, sea stone and cloud infinitely small. 
And there the migrant and his wanderers
may find the new land, and their future wars
may roll, exhausted in hissing foam, to sink
over the fish spines, and the blunderers
of fulfillment stare at samsaric wink
of ocean, stare and find sleep that dissolves the curse.

with an esophogeal vowel sound,
and a loneliness creeps
into the conversation by the hot tub. 
We don’t deserve pleasure
just as we don’t deserve pain,
but it’s pure sorcery the way the feathers of warm mist   
keep rising from the surface of the water
to wrap themselves around a sculpted
clavicle or wrist. 
It’s not just that we are on
the eighth story of the world
looking out through glass and steel
with a clarity of vision
in which imported coffee and
a knowledge of French painting
                                              are combined, 
but that we are atop a pyramid
of all the facts that make this possible:   
the furnace that heats the water,   
the truck that hauled the fuel,
the artery of highway
blasted through the mountains, 
the heart attack of the previous owner,   
the history of Western medicine   
that failed to save him,
the successful development of tourism,
the snow white lotions that counteract the chemistry   
of chlorine upon skin—our skin. 
Down inside history’s body,
the slaves are still singing in the dark;   
the roads continue to be built;
the wind blows and the building grips itself   
in anticipation of the next strong gust. 
So an enormous act of forgetting is required   
simply to kiss someone
or to open your mouth
for the fork of high-calorie paté
someone is raising to your lips, 
which, considering the price,   
it would be a sin   
not to enjoy.

Twenty-eight shotgun pellets
crater my thighs, belly and groin.
I gently thumb each burnt bead,
fingering scabbed stubs with ointment. 
Could have neutered me, made extinct
the volatile, romantic man I am.
“He’s dead,”
doctor at emergency room
could’ve easily told my wife that night.
Instead, “Soak him in a bath twice a day. Apply
this ointment to the sores. Here’s a month’s supply
of pain killers.” I remember the deep guttural groan
I gave, when the doctor pressed my groin.
                  Assured
I could still make love, morphine drowsed me
and in a dull stupor I don’t remember
police visiting my bed, or laughing so hard,
they scowled for a serious answer.
I howled a U.F.O. shot me along the Río Grande,
and they cursed and left. 
In the summer of ’88
I’d traded alfalfa for a bull calf.
Still smelling of milk udders,
I tied it to the truck rack and drove off.
Its hooves teethed
at pink roots
’til the whole lush field went bare dirt.
A magnificent bull.
Glowing wheel of heart
breathed brimming stream of white flame at dawn.
He wrangled his black brawn
like a battleshield to challenge the sun,
reared thick neck down and sideways,
lunged at me with dart and snort,
hoof-stamped and nostrilled dirt,
                  ’til I growled him back
                  whipping air
                  with a limber willow branch,
                  poured grain in trough
                  and spread alfalfa.
I respected his horns
and he the whistling
menace of willow. 
One afternoon my cousin Patricio
helped me band the bull’s scrotum,
usurp swollen sap
in his testicle sack. It withered
to a pink wattle and seeded
the garden to drive cornstalks
to bear hardy, golden horns. 
Thereafter, he grazed the fenceline,
with the tempered lust and peaceful grace
of a celibate priest.
His bearing now arranged itself
elegant as a wild flower
sprung over night.
                  ______________ 
Perfecto shot it.
Rasping on a black rope of blood
round its neck, it staggered,
bouldering convulsions.
Blood exploding
in bright lash of earthquaked air,
it stumble-butted stock trailer fender—
second and third shots glowed
its death. 
A quivering shadow of life-flame
darkened the air and it sputtered
a last drop of blood.
I drank long swigs
of whiskey and, thinking it was dead,
turned to walk away,
then
                  it gave a tremendous groan, tremendous groan,
                  a birth-letting groan . . . a moon groan . . .
                  blood spurted out, thick, thick, thick
                  alleys of dead star blood 
                  and I turned and said aloud to myself,
                                    “That’s the moon’s voice!
                                    That’s the moon’s voice!” 
And the white moon was in the sky,
and I looked at the moon for a long time.
                  ______________ 
I sat on the ground
and gulped whiskey, drank the steer’s death
still warm in my throat.
A beautiful animal! I allowed to be butchered.
When it trounced and galloped in the field,
its body was a dark, windy cliff edge,
and its eyes were doorways of a dream—
                  now it bled a charred scroll
                  of ancient chant in gravel, I would never know,
                  and its blackened logs of blood
                  smoldered dying vowels, I would never hear.
My heart’s creak-n-tremble rage
milled the steer’s death to red grist,
I grieved,
I wept drunkenly
that no one cared,
                  that humankind betrayed him,
                  that we were all cowards.
                  ______________ 
Perfecto, Valasquez and the butcher
tried to stop me
from driving,
                               but now was the time to settle
                               a bad feud with another friend.
                               Redeem the bull’s blood with ours.
                  I drove to Felipe’s house,
                  anger knotted in me
                  tight as the rope tied
                  to the stock trailer
                  steer strained against.
                  I pulled, but could not free myself.
                  (I had a dream night before—
                  I crossed black-iron footbridge,
                  partially collapsed by sea storm.
                  Left-hand railing swept out to sea,
                  I gripped bolt-studded right-hand railing,
                  finger-clutched wire netting sides,
                  carefully descended waist-high water. Waded
                  through slowly and ascended other side—
                  but had lost my sunglasses and wallet,
                  went back, groped bottom, found them and ascended again.) 
Had to cross that bridge again.
Full of significance . . . tonight,
deepest part of flooded bridge was danger . . . drowning . . .
represented years of my life collapsed
and destroyed, water the cleansing element,
my ascent from had healed, onto firm ground,
but I went back, to re-live
destruction…
                  “Felipe!” I yelled, porch light
                  flicked on, illuminating the yard.
                  “Came to fight,” I said, “take off
                  your glasses.” 
Bug-eyes glazed
bewildered, then gray slits of lips
snarled, “You motherless dog!”
He withdrew in darkness a moment,
reappeared on porch, serrated saw of his voice
cut the chill dark,
                  “¡Hijo de su pinche madre!
                   ¡Mátalo!   ¡¡Mátalo!!” 
First shot framed darkness round me
with a spillway of bright light,
eruption of sound, and second shot roared
a spray of brilliance and the third
gave an expanded halo-flash.
My legs woozed, and then
I buckled to the ground.
                  (I thought, holy shit, what ever happened
                  to the old yard-style fight between estranged friends!) 
I groaned with the steer,
and crawled my dead legs
to the truck, lunged on elbows into the cab,
hand lifting the dead stone beneath my waist
to clutch and brake. 
Following morning calls came,
“Tell us who did it Gato!”
“Our rifles are loaded!”
                  I said, “Leave it alone. What would you do
                            if a drunk man came into your yard,
                            threatened to beat you?”
I wanted peace,
wanted to diffuse the immovable core
of vengeance in my heart,
I had carried since a child,
dismantle the bloody wheel of violence
I had ridden since a child. 
During my week in bed,
pellets pollinated me
with a forgotten peace,
and between waking thoughts of anger and vengeance,
sleep was a small meadow of light,
a clearing I walked into and rested. Fragrance of peace
filled me as fragrance
of flowers and dirt permeate hands
that work in the garden all day.  Curandero came to visit, and said,
“The bull in ancient times was the symbol of females.
Did you know that? Killing the bull,
is killing the intuitive part of yourself,
the feminine part. Did you realize,
when Jesus was raising Lazarus,
he groaned in his spirit and that bull groaned,
and when you killed the bull, it was raising you.
The dying bull gave birth to you and now you are either
blessed or cursed. The flood of that bull’s blood,
is either going to drown you or liberate you,
but it will not be wasted.”

Apprentice morning come easily now,
silver with fog and the breakdowns
of neighbors: shouts from up hill
where the land curls under vines and under the porches   
of oaks, where even now
wintergreen and inkberry shiver forth
streamers of new growth, and the green frogs
suck at the dew and sing their bent songs. 
It is easy
to hear my own voice in the liquid
contraltos of rage, the vents
and accusations that feed fires
up the hill. It is all human enough,
the yelling, capacious
and frank, the doors slamming, cries
of betrayal. I too have betrayed,
lost my place among the condensations   
of commitment, dallied.
                                                I go among friends
who say with neither fear nor fury in their voices
that they too don’t know what’s next, that from the studied   
impactment of their lives
they have sallied small lines
of proposition, made a few calls. Slight affairs   
shiver and fail; we go for a walk
by the rotunda, where, on the perishable lawn,   
a band plays Dixieland—speaking,
not earnestly, but with steady intent,
of the play of choices, the simple chance
of another future somewhere else, perhaps a house   
in the hills above L.A., part-time work   
for the screen, a few avocado trees. For a while
it is as if the hazy play of evening light,
the splashes of music, the unbundled oaks
surrounding the Square, are enough
in themselves to sustain, as if mood
is itself sustenance, that our struggle to conceive   
a continuance is of no more moment
than the fuchsia and soft yellow clothes of the tourists. 
Perhaps it is possible
to be gentle no matter what, to seek not restraint   
but surrender entirely, to turn
from the snarling reproach not into the keening   
dismissal of hope but to whatever bright
fluttering is next, the bright fluttering
of wisteria petals, a felicitous
phrase, fingers touching
a face. How else to avoid
redemption,
or its opposite, which we stopped believing   
in one day in high school, suddenly startled   
over a steaming lunch tray by the way the fizzed   
flowers of a stunted mimosa
seemed to beg for release? We realized then
we could say whatever we wanted, that the world   
was no more particular
than anything else, it too could be out-argued,   
confused by refusal or lies, that it was no wonder   
people were stunned
by the eloquent permanence of death.
                                                                        So there is   
permission, not granted
but given, as a forsythia at the edge of the walk,   
having stolen more light
than it can contain, trembles, and the echoes
of argument fade into a fluttering
over the price of butterscotch floats,
and we are dazzled
by the gouge of perception, as if there was in fact a word   
we were waiting to hear, not
as completion but as synoptic
and inevitable entitlement—the drift
of some stranger’s conversation,
the memory of a thin mist
moored temporarily over the garden, that face
we saw from the window on the way to St. Albans: beautiful,   
indifferent, unequivocably doomed.

this is just to say I saw the icebox and wheels
rumbling through the figure 5
I saw the white chickens
in the dark city glazed with rain
I saw the figure 5 in the white chickens
the plums that were in gold on a red wheel barrow
the plums that you were probably
saving among the rain water
I have eaten the dark city so sweet
the plums that were so sweet
this is just to say I have eaten the figure 5
in the plums that so much depends
that were in gold on a red firetruck

Because the eye has a short shadow or
it is hard to see over heads in the crowd? 
If everyone else seems smarter
but you need your own secret? 
If mystery was never your friend? 
If one way could satisfy
the infinite heart of the heavens? 
If you liked the king on his golden throne
more than the villagers carrying baskets of lemons? 
If you wanted to be sure
his guards would admit you to the party? 
            The boy with the broken pencil
            scrapes his little knife against the lead
            turning and turning it as a point
            emerges from the wood again 
            If he would believe his life is like that
            he would not follow his father into war

The grammatical rules of this language can be learned in one
sitting. 
Nouns have no gender & end in -o; the plural terminates in -oj
(pronounced -oy) & the accusative, -on (plural 0ojn). 
Amiko, friend; amikoj, friends; amikon & amikojn, accusative
friend & friends. 
Adjectives end in –a & take plural & accusative endings to
agree with things. 
Ma amiko is my friend. 
All verbs are regular & have only one form for each tense or
mood; they are not altered for person or number. Mi havas
bonajn amikojn is simply to say I have good friends. 
Adverbs end in –e. 
La bonaj amiko estas ie. The good friend is here.  - 
A new book appears in Esperanto every week. Radio stations in
Europe, the United States, China, Russia & Brazil broadcast in
Esperanto, as does Vatican Radio. In 1959, UNESCO declared the
International Federation of Esperanto Speakers to be in accord with
its mission & granted this body consultative status. The youth
branch of the International Federation of Esperanto Speakers, UTA,
has offices in 80 different countries & organizes social events where
young people curious about the movement may dance to recordings
by Esperanto artists, enjoy complimentary soft drinks & take home
Esperanto versions of major literary works including the Old
Testament & A Midsummer Night’s Dream. William Shatner’s first
feature-length vehicle was a horror film shot entirely in Esperanto.
Esperanto is among the languages currently sailing into deep space
on board the Voyager spacecraft.  - 
Esperanto is an artificial language
constructed in 1887 by L.
    L. Zamenhof, a polish
         oculist. I first came
across Fundamento Esperanto, the text
    which introduced this system
            to the world, as I travelled abroad 
following a somewhat difficult period
in my life. It was twilight & snowing on the
    railway platform just outside
         Warsaw where I had missed
my connection. A man in a crumpled track suit
    & dark glasses pushed a cart
            piled high with ripped & weathered volumes— 
sex manuals, detective stories, yellowing
musical scores & outdated physics textbooks,
    old copies of Life, new smut,
         an atlas translated,
a grammar, The Mirror, Soviet-bloc comics,
    a guide to the rivers &
            mountains, thesauri, inscrutable 
musical scores & mimeographed physics books,
defective stories, obsolete sex manuals—
         one of which caught my notice
         (Dr. Esperanto,
Zamenhof’s pen name, translates as He Who Hopes) &
    since I had time, I traded
         my used Leaves of Grass for a copy.  - 
Mi amas vin, bela amiko.
I’m afraid I will never be lonely enough.
There’s a man from Quebec in my head, 
a friend to the purple martins.
Purple martins are the Cadillac of swallows.
All purple martins are dying or dead.
Brainscans of grown purple martins suggest
these creatures feel the same levels of doubt 
& bliss as an eight-year-old girl in captivity.
While driving home from the brewery
one night this man from Quebec heard a radio program
about purple martins & the next day he set out
to build them a house
in his own back yard. I’ve never built anything,
let alone a house, 
not to mention a home
for somebody else. 
I’ve never unrolled a blueprint onto a workbench,
sunk a post,
or sent the neighbor’s kid pedalling off
to the store for a bag full of nails. 
I’ve never waited ten years for a swallow. 
Never put in aluminum floors to smooth over the waiting.
Never piped sugar water through colored tubes
to each empty nest lined with newspaper shredded
with strong, tired hands.
Never dismantled the entire affair 
& put it back together again.
Still no swallows.
I never installed the big light that stays on through the night 
to keep owls away. Never installed lesser lights,
never rested on Sunday 
with a beer on the deck surveying
what I had done
& what yet remained to be done, listening to Styx 
while the neighbor kids ran through my sprinklers.
I have never collapsed in abandon.
Never prayed.
But enough about purple martins.  - 
As we speak, Esperanto is being corrupted
by upset languages such as Interlingua,
Klingon, Java & various cryptophasic tongues. 
Our only hope of reversing this trend is to write
the Esperanto epic. Through its grandeur
& homegrown humility, it will spur men 
to freeze the mutating patios so the children
of our children’s children may dwell in this song
& find comfort in its true texture & frame. 
It’s worth a try. As I imagine it, it ends
in the middle of things. Every line of the work
is a first & a last line & this is the spring 
of its action. Of course, there’s a journey
& inside that journey, an implicit voyage
through the underworld. There’s a bridge 
made of boats; a carp stuffed with flowers;
a comic dispute among sweetmeat vendors;
a digression on shadows; men clapping 
in fields to scare away crows; an unending list
of warships: The Unternehmen, The Impresa,
The Muyarchi, Viec Lam, The Przedsiebiorstwo, 
The Indarka, The Enterprise, L’Entreprise,
Entrepeno

Processionals in the exemplary cave,
Benediction of shadows. Pomfret. London.
The voice fragrant with mannered humility,
With an equable contempt for this world,
‘In honorem Trinitatis’. Crash. The head
Struck down into a meaty conduit of blood.
So these dispose themselves to receive each
Pentecostal blow from axe or seraph,
Spattering block-straw with mortal residue.
Psalteries whine through the empyrean. Fire
Flares in the pit, ghosting upon stone
Creatures of such rampant state, vacuous
Ceremony of possession, restless
Habitation, no man’s dwelling-place.  
2 
For whom do we scrape our tribute of pain—
For none but the ritual king? We meditate
A rueful mystery; we are dying
To satisfy fat Caritas, those
Wiped jaws of stone. (Suppose all reconciled
By silent music; imagine the future
Flashed back at us, like steel against sun,
Ultimate recompense.) Recall the cold
Of Towton on Palm Sunday before dawn,
Wakefield, Tewkesbury: fastidious trumpets
Shrilling into the ruck; some trampled
Acres, parched, sodden or blanched by sleet,
Stuck with strange-postured dead. Recall the wind’s
Flurrying, darkness over the human mire.  
3 
They bespoke doomsday and they meant it by
God, their curved metal rimming the low ridge.
But few appearances are like this. Once
Every five hundred years a comet’s
Over-riding stillness might reveal men
In such array, livid and featureless,
With England crouched beastwise beneath it all.
‘Oh, that old northern business …’ A field
After battle utters its own sound
Which is like nothing on earth, but is earth.
Blindly the questing snail, vulnerable
Mole emerge, blindly we lie down, blindly
Among carnage the most delicate souls
Tup in their marriage-blood, gasping ‘Jesus’.  
4 
Let mind be more precious than soul; it will not
Endure. Soul grasps its price, begs its own peace,
Settles with tears and sweat, is possibly
Indestructible. That I can believe.
Though I would scorn the mere instinct of faith,
Expediency of assent, if I dared,
What I dare not is a waste history
Or void rule. Averroes, old heathen,
If only you had been right, if Intellect
Itself were absolute law, sufficient grace,
Our lives could be a myth of captivity
Which we might enter: an unpeopled region
Of ever new-fallen snow, a palace blazing
With perpetual silence as with torches.  
5 
As with torches we go, at wild Christmas,
When we revel in our atonement
Through thirty feasts of unction and slaughter,
What is that but the soul’s winter sleep?
So many things rest under consummate
Justice as though trumpets purified law,
Spikenard were the real essence of remorse.
The sky gathers up darkness. When we chant
‘Ora, ora pro nobis’ it is not
Seraphs who descend to pity but ourselves.
Those righteously-accused those vengeful
Racked on articulate looms indulge us
With lingering shows of pain, a flagrant
Tenderness of the damned for their own flesh:  
6 
My little son, when you could command marvels
Without mercy, outstare the wearisome
Dragon of sleep, I rejoiced above all—
A stranger well-received in your kingdom.
On those pristine fields I saw humankind
As it was named by the Father; fabulous
Beasts rearing in stillness to be blessed.
The world’s real cries reached there, turbulence
From remote storms, rumour of solitudes,
A composed mystery. And so it ends.
Some parch for what they were; others are made
Blind to all but one vision, their necessity
To be reconciled. I believe in my
Abandonment, since it is what I have.  
7 
‘Prowess, vanity, mutual regard,
It seemed I stared at them, they at me.
That was the gorgon’s true and mortal gaze:
Averted conscience turned against itself.’
A hawk and a hawk-shadow. ‘At noon,
As the armies met, each mirrored the other;
Neither was outshone. So they flashed and vanished
And all that survived them was the stark ground
Of this pain. I made no sound, but once
I stiffened as though a remote cry
Had heralded my name. It was nothing …’
Reddish ice tinged the reeds; dislodged, a few
Feathers drifted across; carrion birds
Strutted upon the armour of the dead.  
8 
Not as we are but as we must appear,
Contractual ghosts of pity; not as we
Desire life but as they would have us live,
Set apart in timeless colloquy.
So it is required; so we bear witness,
Despite ourselves, to what is beyond us,
Each distant sphere of harmony forever
Poised, unanswerable. If it is without
Consequence when we vaunt and suffer, or
If it is not, all echoes are the same
In such eternity. Then tell me, love,
How that should comfort us—or anyone
Dragged half-unnerved out of this worldly place,
Crying to the end ‘I have not finished’.

Clora, come view my soul, and tell   Whether I have contrived it well.   Now all its several lodgings lie   Composed into one gallery; And the great arras-hangings, made   Of various faces, by are laid;   That, for all furniture, you’ll find   Only your picture in my mind.  Here thou are painted in the dress Of an inhuman murderess;   Examining upon our hearts   Thy fertile shop of cruel arts:   Engines more keen than ever yet   Adorned a tyrant’s cabinet; Of which the most tormenting are Black eyes, red lips, and curlèd hair.  But, on the other side, th’art drawn   Like to Aurora in the dawn; When in the East she slumbering lies,   And stretches out her milky thighs;   While all the morning choir does sing,   And manna falls, and roses spring;   And, at thy feet, the wooing doves   Sit pérfecting their harmless loves.  Like an enchantress here thou show’st,   Vexing thy restless lover’s ghost;   And, by a light obscure, dost rave   Over his entrails, in the cave;   Divining thence, with horrid care,   How long thou shalt continue fair; And (when informed) them throw’st away, To be the greedy vulture’s prey.  But, against that, thou sit’st afloat   Like Venus in her pearly boat. The halcyons, calming all that’s nigh,   Betwixt the air and water fly;   Or, if some rolling wave appears,   A mass of ambergris it bears. Nor blows more wind than what may well   Convoy the perfume to the smell.  These pictures and a thousand more Of thee my gallery do store In all the forms thou canst invent   Either to please me, or torment:   For thou alone to people me,   Art grown a numerous colony;   And a collection choicer far Than or Whitehall’s or Mantua’s were.  But, of these pictures and the rest, That at the entrance likes me best:   Where the same posture, and the look   Remains, with which I first was took:   A tender shepherdess, whose hair Hangs loosely playing in the air,   Transplanting flowers from the green hill,   To crown her head, and bosom fill.

I  You are clear O rose, cut in rock, hard as the descent of hail.  I could scrape the colour   from the petals like spilt dye from a rock.  If I could break you   I could break a tree.  If I could stir I could break a tree— I could break you.   II  O wind, rend open the heat,   cut apart the heat,   rend it to tatters.  Fruit cannot drop   through this thick air— fruit cannot fall into heat that presses up and blunts the points of pears   and rounds the grapes.  Cut the heat— plough through it, turning it on either side   of your path.

I saw the spot where our first parents dwelt;  And yet it wore to me no face of change,  For while amid its fields and groves, I felt  As if I had not sinned, nor thought it strange;  My eye seemed but a part of every sight,  My ear heard music in each sound that rose; Each sense forever found a new delight,  Such as the spirit’s vision only knows;  Each act some new and ever-varying joy  Did my Father’s love for me prepare;  To dress the spot my ever fresh employ,  And in the glorious whole with Him to share;  No more without the flaming gate to stray,  No more for sin’s dark stain the debt of death to pay.

for Peter Orr

When all the rooms of the house
fill with smoke, it’s not enough
to say an angel is sleeping on the chimney.



1. a night in the barn 
The deer carcass hangs from a rafter.
Wrapped in blankets, a boy keeps watch
from a pile of loose hay. Then he sleeps 
and dreams about a death that is coming:
Inside him, there are small bones
scattered in a field among burdocks and dead grass.
He will spend his life walking there,
gathering the bones together. 
Pigeons rustle in the eaves.
At his feet, the German shepherd
snaps its jaws in its sleep.  
          2
A father and his four sons
run down a slope toward
a deer they just killed.
The father and two sons carry
rifles. They laugh, jostle,
and chatter together.
A gun goes off
and the youngest brother
falls to the ground.
A boy with a rifle
stands beside him,
screaming.  
          3
I crouch in the corner of my room,
staring into the glass well
of my hands; far down
I see him drowning in air. 
Outside, leaves shaped like mouths
make a black pool
under a tree. Snails glide
there, little death-swans.  
          4. smoke
Something has covered the chimney
and the whole house fills with smoke.
I go outside and look up at the roof,
but I can’t see anything.
I go back inside. Everyone weeps,
walking from room to room.
Their eyes ache. This smoke
turns people into shadows.
Even after it is gone
and the tears are gone,
we will smell it in pillows
when we lie down to sleep.  
          5
He lives in a house of black glass.
Sometimes I visit him, and we talk.
My father says he is dead,
but what does that mean?
Last night I found a child
sleeping on a nest of bones.
He had a red, leaf-shaped
scar on his cheek.
I lifted him up
and carried him with me,
though I didn’t know where I was going.  
          6. the journey
Each night, I knelt on a marble slab
and scrubbed at the blood.
I scrubbed for years and still it was there.
But tonight the bones in my feet
begin to burn. I stand up
and start walking, and the slab
appears under my feet with each step,
a white road only as long as your body.  
          7. the distance
The winter I was eight, a horse
slipped on the ice, breaking its leg.
Father took a rifle, a can of gasoline.
I stood by the road at dusk and watched
the carcass burning in the far pasture. 
I was twelve when I killed him;
I felt my own bones wrench from my body.
Now I am twenty-seven and walk
beside this river, looking for them.
They have become a bridge
that arches toward the other shore.

[To be sung to the tune of The Blood of the Lamb with indicated instrument]



[BASS DRUM BEATEN LOUDLY]
Booth led boldly with his big bass drum—   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)   
The Saints smiled gravely and they said: “He’s come.”   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)   
Walking lepers followed, rank on rank,   
Lurching bravoes from the ditches dank,   
Drabs from the alleyways and drug fiends pale—   
Minds still passion-ridden, soul-powers frail:—   
Vermin-eaten saints with mouldy breath,   
Unwashed legions with the ways of Death—   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)    
[BANJOS]
Every slum had sent its half-a-score   
The round world over. (Booth had groaned for more.)   
Every banner that the wide world flies   
Bloomed with glory and transcendent dyes.   
Big-voiced lasses made their banjos bang,   
Tranced, fanatical they shrieked and sang:—   
“Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?”   
Hallelujah! It was queer to see   
Bull-necked convicts with that land make free.   
Loons with trumpets blowed a blare, blare, blare   
On, on upward thro’ the golden air!   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)    
[BASS DRUM SLOWER AND SOFTER]
Booth died blind and still by Faith he trod,   
Eyes still dazzled by the ways of God.   
Booth led boldly, and he looked the chief   
Eagle countenance in sharp relief,   
Beard a-flying, air of high command   
Unabated in that holy land.    
[SWEET FLUTE MUSIC]
Jesus came from out the court-house door,   
Stretched his hands above the passing poor.   
Booth saw not, but led his queer ones there   
Round and round the mighty court-house square.   
Yet in an instant all that blear review   
Marched on spotless, clad in raiment new.   
The lame were straightened, withered limbs uncurled   
And blind eyes opened on a new, sweet world.    
[BASS DRUM LOUDER]
Drabs and vixens in a flash made whole!   
Gone was the weasel-head, the snout, the jowl!   
Sages and sibyls now, and athletes clean,   
Rulers of empires, and of forests green!    
[GRAND CHORUS OF ALL INSTRUMENTS.
TAMBOURINES TO THE FOREGROUND]
The hosts were sandalled, and their wings were fire!   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)   
But their noise played havoc with the angel-choir.   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)   
O shout Salvation! It was good to see   
Kings and Princes by the Lamb set free.   
The banjos rattled and the tambourines   
Jing-jing-jingled in the hands of Queens.    
[REVERENTLY SUNG. NO INSTRUMENTS]
And when Booth halted by the curb for prayer   
He saw his Master thro’ the flag-filled air.   
Christ came gently with a robe and crown   
For Booth the soldier, while the throng knelt down.   
He saw King Jesus. They were face to face,   
And he knelt a-weeping in that holy place.   
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Cylinder sacks of water filling the oceans,
endless bullets of water,
skins full of water rolling and tumbling
as we came together.
As though light broke us apart.
As though light came with the rubble of words,
though we die among the husks of remembering.
It is as we knew it would be
in the echoes of endless terminals,
in the slow scaled guises of ourselves
when we came together in the envelopes of ourselves,
the bare shadow, the breath of words invisible;
as slight errors repeating themselves;
as degradation passes like madness through a crowd.
It was not ordained.
It was one drop of salt water against another.

Thus every Creature, and of every Kind,The secret Joys of sweet Coition find:Not only Man’s Imperial Race; but theyThat wing the liquid Air, or swim the Sea,Or haunt the Desert, rush into the flame:For Love is Lord of all; and is in all the same.
  ’Tis with this rage, the Mother Lion stung,Scours o’re the Plain; regardless of her young:Demanding Rites of Love, she sternly stalks;And hunts her Lover in his lonely Walks.
  ’Tis then the shapeless Bear his Den forsakes;In Woods and Fields a wild destruction makes.Boars whet their Tusks; to battle Tygers move;Enrag’d with hunger, more enrag’d with love.Then wo to him, that in the desert LandOf Lybia travels, o’re the burning Sand.The Stallion snuffs the well-known Scent afar;And snorts and trembles for the distant Mare:Nor bitts nor Bridles, can his rage restrain;And rugged Rocks are interpos’d in vain.
He makes his way o’re Mountains, and contemnsUnruly Torrents, and unfoorded Streams.The bristled Boar, who feels the pleasing wound,New grinds his arming Tusks, and digs the ground.The sleepy Leacher shuts his little Eyes;About his churning Chaps the frothy bubbles rise:He rubs his sides against a Tree; preparesAnd hardens both his Shoulders for the Wars.

In the close covert of a groveBy nature formed for scenes of love,Said Susan in a lucky hour:‘Observe yon sweet geranium flower.How straight upon its stalk it stands,And tempts our violating hands,Whilst the soft bud, as yet unspread,Hangs down its pale declining head.Yet soon as it is ripe to blow,The stems shall rise, the head shall glow.’‘Nature,’ said I, ‘my lovely Sue,To all her followers lends a clue.Her simple laws themselves explainAs links of one continued chain;For her the mysteries of creationAre but the works of generation.Yon blushing, strong, triumphant flowerIs in the crisis of its power:But short, alas, its vigorous reign;He sheds his seed, and drops again.The bud that hangs in pale decayFeels not, as yet, the plastic ray.Tomorrow’s sun shall bid him rise,Then, too, he sheds his seed, and dies.But words, my love, are vain and weak; For proof, let bright example speak.’Then straight before the wondering maidThe tree of life I gently laid.‘Observe, sweet Sue, his drooping head,How pale, how languid, and how dead.Yet let the sun of thy bright eyesShine but a moment, it shall rise.Let but the dew of thy soft handRefresh the stem, it straight shall stand.Already, see, it swells, it grows,Its head is redder than the rose,Its shriveled fruit, of dusky hue,Now glows—a present fit for Sue.The balm of life each artery fills,And in o’erflowing drops distils.’‘Oh, me!’ cried Susan, ‘When is this?What strange tumultuous throbs of bliss!Sure, never mortal till this hourFelt such emotion at a flower!Oh, serpent, cunning to deceive,Sure ’tis this tree that tempted Eve.The crimson apples hang so fairAlas! what woman could forbear?’‘Well hast thou guessed, my love,’ I cried,‘It is the tree by which she died –The tree which could alone content her.All nature, Susan, seeks the centre.Yet let us still poor Eve forgive,It’s the tree by which we live.For lovely women still it grows,And in the centre only blows.But chief for thee it spreads its charms,For paradise is in thy arms …’I ceased, for nature kindly hereBegan to whisper in her ear,And lovely Sue lay softly pantingWhile the geranium tree was planting,’Til in the heat of amorous strifeShe burst the mellow tree of life.‘Oh, heaven!’ cried Susan with a sigh,‘The hour we taste – we surely die.Strange raptures seize my fainting frame,And all my body glows with flame.Yet let me snatch one parting kissTo tell my love I die with bliss –That pleased thy Susan yields her breath;Oh, who would live, if this be death?’

for Gabriele Mintz



As Billy goes higher all the balloons
Get marooned on the other side of the
Lunar landscape. The module’s broke—
It seems like for an eternity, but who’s
Counting—and Sally’s joined the Moonies
So we don’t see so much of her anyhow.
Notorious novelty—I’d settle for a good
Cup of Chase & Sand-borne—though when
The strings are broken on the guitar
You can always use it as a coffee table.
Vienna was cold at that time of year.
The sachertorte tasted sweet but the memory
burned in the colon. Get a grip, get a grip, before
The Grippe gets you. Glad to see the picture
Of ink—the pitcher that pours before
Throwing the Ball, with never a catcher in sight.
Never a catcher but sometimes a catch, or
A clinch or a clutch or a spoon—never a
Catcher but plenty o’flack, ’till we meet
On this side of the tune.

1914-1918



The Garden called Gethsemane   
   In Picardy it was,   
And there the people came to see   
   The English soldiers pass.
We used to pass—we used to pass   
   Or halt, as it might be,
And ship our masks in case of gas   
   Beyond Gethsemane. 
The Garden called Gethsemane,   
   It held a pretty lass,
But all the time she talked to me
   I prayed my cup might pass.   
The officer sat on the chair,
   The men lay on the grass,   
And all the time we halted there
   I prayed my cup might pass. 
It didn’t pass—it didn’t pass-
   It didn’t pass from me.
I drank it when we met the gas   
   Beyond Gethsemane!

Very sad,
Having to
Come out of nowhere, 
The rain
We’ve been waiting for
Is waiting too. 
Trees,
By now,
Have had enough daylight. 
They’d like,
Please,
To sleep it off. 
If nothing
Else, nothing
Else. 
Behind our backs
Things mean themselves.
Violins crack 
From wanting to exist.
It’s hard, getting a word in.
I’m waiting 
To arrive inside my clothes,
If nothing else,
Willing 
To be (having to
Come out of nowhere)
Very sad.

Awake in a giant night
is where I am
                   There is a river where my soul,   
hungry as a horse drinks beside me 
An hour of immense possibility flies by   
and I do nothing but sit in the present   
which keeps changing moment to moment 
How can I tell you my mind is a blanket? 
It is an amazing story you won’t believe   
and a beautiful land
where something is always doing in the barns   
especially in autumn
                         Sliding down the hayrick! 
By March the sun is lingering and the land turns wet 
Brooks grow loud
The eddies fill with green scum   
Crocuses lift their heads to say hello 
Soon it is good to be planting
By then the woods are overflowing
with dogwood, redbud, hickory, red and white oaks,   
hazelnut bushes, violets, jacks-in-the-pulpit,   
skunk cabbages, pawpaws and May apples
whose names thrill you because you can name them! 
There are quail and rabbits too—but I go on too long 
Like the animal, I must stop by the water’s edge   
to have a drink and think things over 
* 
That was good. The drink I mean
I feel refreshed and ready for anything
Though I’m not in Vermont or Kentucky unfortunately   
but in New York City, the toughest place in the world 
And it’s December 
Here someone is always weeping, including me
though I tend to cry in monster waves then turn into a fish   
wallowing in my own salty
                         Puddle! Look out
If you aren’t wearing boots you’ll be sorry
and soggy too 
* 
This season’s cruelty hurts me
and others, I’m sure, who’d rather be elsewhere but can’t   
because of their jobs, families, friends, money
It’s rough anyway you look at it 
But what can you do? 
It’s worse elsewhere, I’m sure    
Take Vietnam 
No thanks 
I think about Vietnam a lot, however   
and wonder if I’ll ever “see” it   
The way I’ve seen Europe, I mean 
Those pretty Dutch girls!   
They all ride bicycles 
In Venice you travel by boat or foot 
The metro and the underground register like the names   
in connection with them: 
Hugo, Stephen, Stuart, Larry, Lee, Harry, David, Maxine    
What does it all mean?
I never ask that, being shy 
In this apartment in which I dwell these thoughts pass by    
I hope you won’t mind the mess when you do too    
* 
You just walk in up a flight and you’re in paradise 
A cup of coffee, an easy chair, a loving person waiting for you   
who’s washing the dishes, reading a book 
Outside someone’s worrying about love and not sitting down either 
He’s probably freezing his ass off right now!
And other vital parts which would feel great in the country,   
taking a walk, a hike, shoveling snow 
Though you can do that right here 
* 
The hub of the universe is where I am in a night whose promise   
grows with me, unlike the snow melting in the gutter 
Whatever I do, it is beside me 
I look out the window, there is night
I sit in this lighted room knowing this night   
Night! Night! I wish you’d go so I could go
to the post office, the bank, the supermarket 
Why aren’t they open at night? I wonder   
Then realize I’m not the only person who’s   
considered in the grand scope of daily living 
There are those fast asleep who want to be and would be horrified   
if the post office, the bank, and the supermarket
were only open at night
for you can’t be all there all the time
I myself am only here part of the time   
which is enough
                  For there are other places to run to 
Uptown, for example, where energy rushes you   
like some hideous but intriguing chemical
you can’t ignore
and you want to absorb the wisdom these buildings have 
How do they feel so high up like that? 
Pretty good, they seem to say in their absolute way   
But it’s the people inside who turn us on 
By then you are gone off in a cab   
and you are not alone 
                        I am beside you 
The streets are familiar from just traveling through   
We rarely stop and when we do there’s a reason 
Which is too bad
We miss a lot for this same reason 
* 
They’re probably feeding the chickens about this time   
The smell of chicken feed overwhelms me
The rooster crows on a 7th Street fire escape
Breakfast is ready
                         There is a forest by the river near the barn   
where things are happening,
a whole new world on the edge of dawn 
* 
My little world goes on St. Mark’s Place    
To be not tired, but elated, I sing this song 
I think of The Beatles and The Beach Boys   
and the songs they sing 
It is a different thing to be behind the sound   
then leave it forever
and it goes on without them, needing only you and me 
Here I am, though you are asleep 
The morning of December 3rd dawns on me   
in the shape of a poem called “Giant Night” 
It must end before it is too late 
All over the world children will celebrate Christmas
And families will gather together to give and take this season 
Other religions and customs will prevail in their own separate ways   
having nothing to do with Christmas 
Soldiers will cease fire 
Some won’t know the difference but might be able to sense it   
    in the air 
The smell of holly, pine, eggnog
The friendly faces of Santa and his elves 
All these will add up to something and be gone forever    
Just like what is here one minute and not the next.

... who can bear the idea of Eternal Recurrence?



I 
Even as you went over, Nietzsche,
in your last letter, as ever, you tried
to reach him:
                     “Dear Herr Professor,
When it comes to it I too would very much
prefer a professorial chair in Basel
to being God; but I did not dare to go
so far in my private egoism as to refrain
for its sake from the creation of the world.” 
The past before him, the hateful present
stifling no end of futures with noisy smoke,
what could the Dear Herr Professor, magnificently
sober Jacob Burckhardt, do or do for you;
how thrust pitiful hands into what proclaimed
itself a sacred solitude?
                                       Maybe too at times,
syringa blowing through his classroom (gape-
mouthed angels Paracelsus pressed into his lectures
in this very room, throwing all Basel
into an uproar and a hatred that finally
drove him out,
                      familiars also like a rout
of mornings bickering to swell the retinue
of Dr. Faustus after breakfast), trumpeting
through the profundity of his pauses, 
maybe he could let that host, with nothing
to lose in being, be themselves, especially
as there sprang among them heroes out of Raphael
with everything to gain.
                                     Even now Astorre
the horseman, in the twinkle of that scholar
eye, spurs quarrying the dark, falcon-plumed,
plunges, a warrior of Heaven, to the rescue
of a youth, fallen with copious wounds,
by this aid exalted.  
             II 
                              Alas, for all Astorre’s
audacious charging down the margin of the page,
the Professor’s age, parading with its Sunday
family-walks and the thundrous drummers of Basel
in trim, upholstered parks, benumbed him. 
What was there for him to do who saw
his begetters, fighting men, furious, mighty
in their pride, tumbled to such petty end? 
That beauty being slain on the high places
in the midst of its noblest battle, should he,
exclaiming, dare to tell it, publish it
in the streets so prim and polished, to see
the daughters of the philistines rejoice? 
He let you go, best emparadised,
or so you said, in the sparkling shadow
of a sword, retiring into frozen heights,
a terrible loneliness, enhanced by sun.  
             III 
At the end, rocks breaking their doors for you,
out poured the shaggy men, hordes of flame
and drunkenness. Solitude, dressed in winds
and falcons, rang, a honeycomb of voices
hailing:
             dancer David; Agamemnon, amethyst
with proud and deadly twisting; Dr. Faustus;
Borgia and Astorre, those human hours,
sowing splendors with their wily wrists. 
The peaks, much moved, conscious of the love
that guides by the same capricious path as stars
the agony, the maggot’s tooth, hurtling
to your beloved town, stormed its arcades
past the drowsiest beds. God was dead,
long live the gods.
                              In that third-floor room,
still going about in your academic jacket
and down at heel, all the heavens rejoicing,
laughing, lifting up your legs,
into the middle of the rout you leaped,
a satyr’s dance, as always, the conclusion
of the tragic truth . . .  
             IV 
                                    You in what we are,
alas, and by your effort that had to fail
have reached us.
                         And we go, perhaps as the Dear
Herr Professor did, saddened that we cannot
give ourselves,
                        the Greeks at last, Paul,
St. Augustine, Luther, Calvin too, surpassed
by the resolution—not time could tame it,
not the mob’s indifference—of your fury.


^^EOP^^

You ask me what since we must partYou shall bring back to me.Bring back a pure and faithful heartAs true as mine to thee.
You talk of gems from foreign lands,Of treasure, spoil, and prize.Ah love! I shall not search your handsBut look into your eyes.

There’s a mystery
By the river, in one of the cabins
Shuttered with planks, its lock
Twisted; a bunch of magazines flipped open,
A body. A blanket stuffed with leaves
Or lengths of rope, an empty gin bottle.
Put down your newspaper. Look out
Beyond the bluffs, a coal barge is passing,
Its deck nearly
Level with the water, where it comes back riding
High. You start talking about nothing,
Or that famous party, where you went dressed
As a river. They listen,
The man beside you touching his odd face
In the countertop, the woman stirring tonic
In your glass. Down the bar the talk’s divorce,
The docks, the nets
Filling with branches and sour fish. Listen,
I knew a woman who’d poke a hole in an egg, suck
It clean and fill the shell with gin,
Then walk around all day disgusting people
Until she was so drunk
The globe of gin broke in her hand. She’d stay
Alone at night on the boat, come back
Looking for another egg. That appeals to you, rocking
For hours carving at a hollow stone. Or finding
A trail by accident, walking the bluff’s
Face. You know, your friends complain. They say
You give up only the vaguest news, and give a bakery
As your phone. Even your stories
Have no point, just lots of detail: The room
Was long and bright, small and close, angering Gaston;
They turned away to embrace him; She wore
The color out of season,
She wore hardly anything at all; Nobody died; Saturday.
These disguises of omission. Like forgetting
To say obtuse when you talk about the sun, leaving
Off the buttons as you’re sewing up the coat. So,
People take the little
They know to make a marvelous stew;
Sometimes, it even resembles you. It’s not so much
You cover your tracks, as that they bloom
In such false directions. This way friends who awaken
At night, beside you, awaken alone.

Am I the only one
                           watching
my neighbour’s
                      frolicksome goat,
Ginger,
            tied to a pecan tree?
All morning
                  it has been examining
an empty bushel basket
                                  and has lifted
one leg delicately
                            like a circus horse
as if to roll it,
                           but whether to do that
or to butt it
                     with its small horns,
that is the question.
                                 Not of great moment,
no signing of the Charter,
                                        but like air music,
quickest of the elements.
                                       Towards which I leaped! 
In form
            its own grace,
appearing,
                as it passed
in retrospect, classical. 
The real goat stayed,
                                 imperturbable,
the body solid
                      as a four-square loom
and delivered me
                         from abstraction.
His coloring,
                     greyish-soft shades,
their dark and light
                        passing into each other
as in an antique rubbing. 
I now found myself
                            sitting so near,
my shade,
               as in the Inferno,
sensed his,
                  but he gave no sign
of my presence,
                        even when I stroked him
and my heart leaped
                              at the gentle fleece,
too fine for a hard life.
He continued nibbling
                                 on a dry bush. 
I would not have believed
                                       unconcern
could bolster the man in me
                                          and be so enduring. Sic transit, not caring
                                    whether it is recognized,
The Divine
                (from another age). 
He was poking
                     into the underbush now
and reached across my head
                                        for the small spiny twigs. 
At that the phase
                           changed
and a sensuous trembling
                                     hung in the air,
as when a bee is about
                                  to descend
on blossoming clover,
                                 and I
felt myself being pulled
                                     as by a line
from the invisible
                            other side
to enter goathood,
                            deeper than sight.

She came to see the bones
whiten in a summer,
and one year later a narrow
mummy with a dusty skin
and flaking scales
would break apart in her hand. 
She wanted to see if sunlight
still glinted in those eyes,
to know what it lighted
from a window on the mallow roots,
leaf mold and fallen casques. 
And to ask if a single tongue,
one forked flicker in the dark,
had found any heat in death:
in the closed space and chill
of that burial, what speech,
what sign would there be. 
She who walked in the canyon early,
parted the grass and halted
upon the living snake, coiled
and mottled by a bitter pool, 
unearthed her jar in another spring,
to find the snake spirit gone,
only a little green water standing,
some dust, or a smell. 
                                                    (1974)

came in an envelope with no return address;
she was small, wore wrinkled dress of figured
cotton, full from neck to ankles, with a button
of bone at the throat, a collar of torn lace.
She was standing before a monumental house—
on the scale you see in certain English films:
urns, curved drives, stone lions, and an entrance far
too vast for any home. She was not of that place,
for she had a foreign look, and tangled black hair,
and an ikon, heavy and strange, dangling from
an oversize chain around her neck, that looked
as if some tall adult had taken it from his,
and hung it there as a charm to keep her safe
from a world of infinite harm that soon
would take him far from her, and leave her
standing, as she stood now—barefoot, gazing
without expression into distance, away
from the grandeur of that house, its gravel
walks and sculpted gardens. She carried a basket
full of flames, but whether fire or flowers
with crimson petals shading toward a central gold,
was hard to say—though certainly, it burned,
and the light within it had nowhere else
to go, and so fed on itself, intensified its red
and burning glow, the only color in the scene.
The rest was done in grays, light and shadow
as they played along her dress, across her face,
and through her midnight hair, lively with bees.
At first they seemed just errant bits of shade,
until the humming grew too loud to be denied
as the bees flew in and out, as if choreographed
in a country dance between the fields of sun
and the black tangle of her hair.
                                                   Without warning
a window on one of the upper floors flew open—
wind had caught the casement, a silken length
of curtain filled like a billowing sail—the bees
began to stream out from her hair, straight
to the single opening in the high facade. Inside,
a moment later—the sound of screams. 
The girl—who had through all of this seemed
unconcerned and blank—all at once looked up.
She shook her head, her mane of hair freed
of its burden of bees, and walked away,
out of the picture frame, far beyond
the confines of the envelope that brought her
image here—here, where the days grow longer
now, the air begins to warm, dread grows to
fear among us, and the bees swarm.

Give all to love; Obey thy heart; Friends, kindred, days, Estate, good-fame, Plans, credit and the Muse,— Nothing refuse.  ’T is a brave master; Let it have scope: Follow it utterly, Hope beyond hope: High and more high It dives into noon, With wing unspent, Untold intent: But it is a god, Knows its own path And the outlets of the sky.  It was never for the mean; It requireth courage stout. Souls above doubt, Valor unbending, It will reward,— They shall return More than they were, And ever ascending.  Leave all for love; Yet, hear me, yet, One word more thy heart behoved, One pulse more of firm endeavor,— Keep thee to-day, To-morrow, forever, Free as an Arab Of thy beloved.  Cling with life to the maid; But when the surprise, First vague shadow of surmise Flits across her bosom young, Of a joy apart from thee, Free be she, fancy-free; Nor thou detain her vesture’s hem, Nor the palest rose she flung From her summer diadem.  Though thou loved her as thyself, As a self of purer clay, Though her parting dims the day, Stealing grace from all alive; Heartily know, When half-gods go,   The gods arrive.

The woman across from me looks so familiar,
but when I turn, her look glances off. At the last
subway stop we rise. I know her, she gives manicures
at Vogue Nails. She has held my hands between hers
several times. She bows and smiles. There the women
wear white smocks like technicians, and plastic tags
with their Christian names. Susan. No, not Susan,
whose hair is cropped short, who is short and stocky.
This older lady does my hands while classical music,
often Mozart, plays. People passing by outside are
doubled in the wall mirror. Two of everyone walk
forward, backward, vanish at the edge of the shop.
Susan does pedicures, pumice on my heels as I sit
on the stainless-steel throne. She bends over, she
kneads my feet in the water like laundry. She pounds
my calves with her fists and her cupped palms slap
a working beat, p’ansori style. She talks to the others
without turning her head, a call in a language shouted
hoarse across fields where a swallow flew and flew
across the ocean, and then fetched back to Korea
a magic gourd seed, back to the farmer’s empty house
where the seed flew from its beak to sprout a green vine.
When the farmer’s wife cut open the ripe fruit, out spilled
seeds of gold. Choi Don Mee writes that some girls
in that country crush petals on their nails, at each tip
red flowers unfold. Yi Yon-ju writes that some women
there, as here, dream of blades, knives, a bowl of blood.

For Ann Saddlemyer,
our heartiest welcomer



I
Vowels ploughed into other: opened ground.   
The mildest February for twenty years   
Is mist bands over furrows, a deep no sound   
Vulnerable to distant gargling tractors.
Our road is steaming, the turned-up acres breathe.   
Now the good life could be to cross a field   
And art a paradigm of earth new from the lathe   
Of ploughs. My lea is deeply tilled.
Old ploughsocks gorge the subsoil of each sense   
And I am quickened with a redolence   
Of farmland as a dark unblown rose.
Wait then...Breasting the mist, in sowers’ aprons,   
My ghosts come striding into their spring stations.   
The dream grain whirls like freakish Easter snows. 
                                  II
Sensings, mountings from the hiding places,   
Words entering almost the sense of touch   
Ferreting themselves out of their dark hutch—
‘These things are not secrets but mysteries,’   
Oisin Kelly told me years ago
In Belfast, hankering after stone
That connived with the chisel, as if the grain   
Remembered what the mallet tapped to know.   
Then I landed in the hedge-school of Glanmore   
And from the backs of ditches hoped to raise
A voice caught back off slug-horn and slow chanter   
That might continue, hold, dispel, appease:   
Vowels ploughed into other, opened ground,   
Each verse returning like the plough turned round. 
                                  III
This evening the cuckoo and the corncrake   
(So much, too much) consorted at twilight.   
It was all crepuscular and iambic.   
Out on the field a baby rabbit
Took his bearings, and I knew the deer
(I’ve seen them too from the window of the house,   
Like connoisseurs, inquisitive of air)   
Were careful under larch and May-green spruce.   
I had said earlier, ‘I won’t relapse   
From this strange loneliness I’ve brought us to.   
Dorothy and William—’ She interrupts:   
‘You’re not going to compare us two...?’   
Outside a rustling and twig-combing breeze   
Refreshes and relents. Is cadences. 
                                  IV
I used to lie with an ear to the line
For that way, they said, there should come a sound   
Escaping ahead, an iron tune
Of flange and piston pitched along the ground,   
But I never heard that. Always, instead,
Struck couplings and shuntings two miles away   
Lifted over the woods. The head
Of a horse swirled back from a gate, a grey   
Turnover of haunch and mane, and I’d look   
Up to the cutting where she’d soon appear.
Two fields back, in the house, small ripples shook   
Silently across our drinking water
(As they are shaking now across my heart)
And vanished into where they seemed to start. 
                                  V
Soft corrugations in the boortree’s trunk,
Its green young shoots, its rods like freckled solder:   
It was our bower as children, a greenish, dank
And snapping memory as I get older.
And elderberry I have learned to call it.
I love its blooms like saucers brimmed with meal,   
Its berries a swart caviar of shot,
A buoyant spawn, a light bruised out of purple.   
Elderberry? It is shires dreaming wine.
Boortree is bower tree, where I played ‘touching tongues’
And felt another’s texture quick on mine.
So, etymologist of roots and graftings,
I fall back to my tree-house and would crouch
Where small buds shoot and flourish in the hush. 
                                  VI
He lived there in the unsayable lights.
He saw the fuchsia in a drizzling noon,
The elderflower at dusk like a risen moon
And green fields greying on the windswept heights.   
‘I will break through,’ he said, ‘what I glazed over   
With perfect mist and peaceful absences’—
Sudden and sure as the man who dared the ice   
And raced his bike across the Moyola River.   
A man we never saw. But in that winter
Of nineteen forty-seven, when the snow
Kept the country bright as a studio,
In a cold where things might crystallize or founder,   
His story quickened us, a wild white goose
Heard after dark above the drifted house. 
                                  VII
Dogger, Rockall, Malin, Irish Sea:
Green, swift upsurges, North Atlantic flux   
Conjured by that strong gale-warning voice,   
Collapse into a sibilant penumbra.
Midnight and closedown. Sirens of the tundra,
Of eel-road, seal-road, keel-road, whale-road, raise   
Their wind-compounded keen behind the baize   
And drive the trawlers to the lee of Wicklow.    L’Etoile, Le Guillemot, La Belle Hélène   
Nursed their bright names this morning in the bay   
That toiled like mortar. It was marvellous   
And actual, I said out loud, ‘A haven,’   
The word deepening, clearing, like the sky   
Elsewhere on Minches, Cromarty, The Faroes. 
                                  VIII
Thunderlight on the split logs: big raindrops   
At body heat and lush with omen
Spattering dark on the hatchet iron.
This morning when a magpie with jerky steps   
Inspected a horse asleep beside the wood   
I thought of dew on armour and carrion.
What would I meet, blood-boltered, on the road?   
How deep into the woodpile sat the toad?
What welters through this dark hush on the crops?   
Do you remember that pension in Les Landes   
Where the old one rocked and rocked and rocked   
A mongol in her lap, to little songs?   
Come to me quick, I am upstairs shaking.   
My all of you birchwood in lightning. 
                                  IX
Outside the kitchen window a black rat
Sways on the briar like infected fruit:
‘It looked me through, it stared me out, I’m not   
Imagining things. Go you out to it.’
Did we come to the wilderness for this?
We have our burnished bay tree at the gate,
Classical, hung with the reek of silage
From the next farm, tart-leafed as inwit.
Blood on a pitchfork, blood on chaff and hay,
Rats speared in the sweat and dust of threshing—
What is my apology for poetry?
The empty briar is swishing
When I come down, and beyond, inside, your face   
Haunts like a new moon glimpsed through tangled glass. 
                                  X
I dreamt we slept in a moss in Donegal
On turf banks under blankets, with our faces   
Exposed all night in a wetting drizzle,   
Pallid as the dripping sapling birches.   
Lorenzo and Jessica in a cold climate.   
Diarmuid and Grainne waiting to be found.   
Darkly asperged and censed, we were laid out   
Like breathing effigies on a raised ground.
And in that dream I dreamt—how like you this?—
Our first night years ago in that hotel   
When you came with your deliberate kiss   
To raise us towards the lovely and painful   
Covenants of flesh; our separateness;   
The respite in our dewy dreaming faces.


^^EOP^^

I 
I can hear little clicks inside my dream.
Night drips its silver tap
down the back.
At 4 A.M. I wake. Thinking 
of the man who
left in September.
His name was Law. 
My face in the bathroom mirror
has white streaks down it.
I rinse the face and return to bed.
Tomorrow I am going to visit my mother.  
SHE 
She lives on a moor in the north.
She lives alone.
Spring opens like a blade there.
I travel all day on trains and bring a lot of books— 
some for my mother, some for me
including The Collected Works Of Emily Brontë.
This is my favourite author. 
Also my main fear, which I mean to confront.
Whenever I visit my mother
I feel I am turning into Emily Brontë, 
my lonely life around me like a moor,
my ungainly body stumping over the mud flats with a look of transformation
that dies when I come in the kitchen door.
What meat is it, Emily, we need?   
THREE 
Three silent women at the kitchen table.
My mother’s kitchen is dark and small but out the window
there is the moor, paralyzed with ice.
It extends as far as the eye can see 
over flat miles to a solid unlit white sky.
Mother and I are chewing lettuce carefully.
The kitchen wall clock emits a ragged low buzz that jumps 
once a minute over the twelve.
I have Emily p. 216 propped open on the sugarbowl
but am covertly watching my mother. 
A thousand questions hit my eyes from the inside.
My mother is studying her lettuce.
I turn to p. 217. 
“In my flight through the kitchen I knocked over Hareton
who was hanging a litter of puppies
from a chairback in the doorway. . . .” 
It is as if we have all been lowered into an atmosphere of glass.
Now and then a remark trails through the glass.
Taxes on the back lot. Not a good melon, 
too early for melons.
Hairdresser in town found God, closes shop every Tuesday.
Mice in the teatowel drawer again.
Little pellets. Chew off 
the corners of the napkins, if they knew
what paper napkins cost nowadays.
Rain tonight. 
Rain tomorrow.
That volcano in the Philippines at it again. What’s her name
Anderson died no not Shirley 
the opera singer. Negress.
Cancer.
Not eating your garnish, you don’t like pimento? 
Out the window I can see dead leaves ticking over the flatland
and dregs of snow scarred by pine filth.
At the middle of the moor 
where the ground goes down into a depression,
the ice has begun to unclench.
Black open water comes 
curdling up like anger. My mother speaks suddenly.
That psychotherapy’s not doing you much good is it?
You aren’t getting over him. 
My mother has a way of summing things up.
She never liked Law much
but she liked the idea of me having a man and getting on with life. 
Well he’s a taker and you’re a giver I hope it works out,
was all she said after she met him.
Give and take were just words to me 
at the time. I had not been in love before.
It was like a wheel rolling downhill.
But early this morning while mother slept 
and I was downstairs reading the part in Wuthering Heights
where Heathcliff clings at the lattice in the storm sobbing
Come in! Come in! to the ghost of his heart’s darling, 
I fell on my knees on the rug and sobbed too.
She knows how to hang puppies,
that Emily. 
It isn’t like taking an aspirin you know, I answer feebly.
Dr. Haw says grief is a long process.
She frowns. What does it accomplish 
all that raking up the past?
Oh—I spread my hands—
I prevail! I look her in the eye.
She grins. Yes you do.  
WHACHER 
Whacher,
Emily’s habitual spelling of this word,
has caused confusion.
For example 
in the first line of the poem printed Tell me, whether, is it winter?
in the Shakespeare Head edition.
But whacher is what she wrote. 
Whacher is what she was.
She whached God and humans and moor wind and open night.
She whached eyes, stars, inside, outside, actual weather. 
She whached the bars of time, which broke.
She whached the poor core of the world,
wide open. 
To be a whacher is not a choice.
There is nowhere to get away from it,
no ledge to climb up to—like a swimmer 
who walks out of the water at sunset
shaking the drops off, it just flies open.
To be a whacher is not in itself sad or happy, 
although she uses these words in her verse
as she uses the emotions of sexual union in her novel,
grazing with euphemism the work of whaching. 
But it has no name.
It is transparent.
Sometimes she calls it Thou. 
“Emily is in the parlour brushing the carpet,”
records Charlotte in 1828.
Unsociable even at home 
and unable to meet the eyes of strangers when she ventured out,
Emily made her awkward way
across days and years whose bareness appalls her biographers. 
This sad stunted life, says one.
Uninteresting, unremarkable, wracked by disappointment
and despair, says another. 
She could have been a great navigator if she’d been male,
suggests a third. Meanwhile
Emily continued to brush into the carpet the question, 
Why cast the world away.
For someone hooked up to Thou,
the world may have seemed a kind of half-finished sentence. 
But in between the neighbour who recalls her
coming in from a walk on the moors
with her face “lit up by a divine light” 
and the sister who tells us
Emily never made a friend in her life,
is a space where the little raw soul 
slips through.
It goes skimming the deep keel like a storm petrel,
out of sight. 
The little raw soul was caught by no one.
She didn’t have friends, children, sex, religion, marriage, success, a salary
or a fear of death. She worked 
in total six months of her life (at a school in Halifax)
and died on the sofa at home at 2 P.M. on a winter afternoon
in her thirty-first year. She spent 
most of the hours of her life brushing the carpet,
walking the moor
or whaching. She says 
it gave her peace.
“All tight and right in which condition it is to be hoped we shall all be this   
    day 4 years,”
she wrote in her Diary Paper of 1837. 
Yet her poetry from beginning to end is concerned with prisons,
vaults, cages, bars, curbs, bits, bolts, fetters,
locked windows, narrow frames, aching walls. 
“Why all the fuss?” asks one critic.
“She wanted liberty. Well didn’t she have it?
A reasonably satisfactory homelife, 
a most satisfactory dreamlife—why all this beating of wings?
What was this cage, invisible to us,
which she felt herself to be confined in?” 
Well there are many ways of being held prisoner,
I am thinking as I stride over the moor.
As a rule after lunch mother has a nap 
and I go out to walk.
The bare blue trees and bleached wooden sky of April
carve into me with knives of light. 
Something inside it reminds me of childhood—
it is the light of the stalled time after lunch
when clocks tick 
and hearts shut
and fathers leave to go back to work
and mothers stand at the kitchen sink pondering 
something they never tell.
You remember too much,
my mother said to me recently. 
Why hold onto all that? And I said,
Where can I put it down?
She shifted to a question about airports. 
Crops of ice are changing to mud all around me
as I push on across the moor
warmed by drifts from the pale blue sun. 
On the edge of the moor our pines
dip and coast in breezes
from somewhere else. 
Perhaps the hardest thing about losing a lover is
to watch the year repeat its days.
It is as if I could dip my hand down 
into time and scoop up
blue and green lozenges of April heat
a year ago in another country. 
I can feel that other day running underneath this one
like an old videotape—here we go fast around the last corner
up the hill to his house, shadows 
of limes and roses blowing in the car window
and music spraying from the radio and him
singing and touching my left hand to his lips. 
Law lived in a high blue room from which he could see the sea.
Time in its transparent loops as it passes beneath me now
still carries the sound of the telephone in that room 
and traffic far off and doves under the window
chuckling coolly and his voice saying,
You beauty. I can feel that beauty’s 
heart beating inside mine as she presses into his arms in the high blue room—
No, I say aloud. I force my arms down
through air which is suddenly cold and heavy as water 
and the videotape jerks to a halt
like a glass slide under a drop of blood.
I stop and turn and stand into the wind, 
which now plunges towards me over the moor.
When Law left I felt so bad I thought I would die.
This is not uncommon. 
I took up the practice of meditation.
Each morning I sat on the floor in front of my sofa
and chanted bits of old Latin prayers.  De profundis clamavi ad te Domine.
Each morning a vision came to me.
Gradually I understood that these were naked glimpses of my soul. 
I called them Nudes.
Nude #1. Woman alone on a hill.
She stands into the wind. 
It is a hard wind slanting from the north.
Long flaps and shreds of flesh rip off the woman’s body and lift
and blow away on the wind, leaving 
an exposed column of nerve and blood and muscle
calling mutely through lipless mouth.
It pains me to record this, 
I am not a melodramatic person.
But soul is “hewn in a wild workshop”
as Charlotte Brontë says of Wuthering Heights. 
Charlotte’s preface to Wuthering Heights is a publicist’s masterpiece.
Like someone carefully not looking at a scorpion
crouched on the arm of the sofa Charlotte 
talks firmly and calmly
about the other furniture of Emily’s workshop—about
the inexorable spirit (“stronger than a man, simpler than a child”), 
the cruel illness (“pain no words can render”),
the autonomous end (“she sank rapidly, she made haste to leave us”)
and about Emily’s total subjection 
to a creative project she could neither understand nor control,
and for which she deserves no more praise nor blame
than if she had opened her mouth 
“to breathe lightning.” The scorpion is inching down
the arm of the sofa while Charlotte
continues to speak helpfully about lightning 
and other weather we may expect to experience
when we enter Emily’s electrical atmosphere.
It is “a horror of great darkness” that awaits us there 
but Emily is not responsible. Emily was in the grip.
“Having formed these beings she did not know what she had done,”
says Charlotte (of Heathcliff and Earnshaw and Catherine). 
Well there are many ways of being held prisoner.
The scorpion takes a light spring and lands on our left knee
as Charlotte concludes, “On herself she had no pity.” 
Pitiless too are the Heights, which Emily called Wuthering
because of their “bracing ventilation”
and “a north wind over the edge.” 
Whaching a north wind grind the moor
that surrounded her father’s house on every side,
formed of a kind of rock called millstone grit, 
taught Emily all she knew about love and its necessities—
an angry education that shapes the way her characters
use one another. “My love for Heathcliff,” says Catherine, 
“resembles the eternal rocks beneath
a source of little visible delight, but necessary.”
Necessary? I notice the sun has dimmed 
and the afternoon air sharpening.
I turn and start to recross the moor towards home.
What are the imperatives 
that hold people like Catherine and Heathcliff
together and apart, like pores blown into hot rock
and then stranded out of reach 
of one another when it hardens? What kind of necessity is that?
The last time I saw Law was a black night in September.
Autumn had begun, 
my knees were cold inside my clothes.
A chill fragment of moon rose.
He stood in my living room and spoke 
without looking at me. Not enough spin on it,
he said of our five years of love.
Inside my chest I felt my heart snap into two pieces 
which floated apart. By now I was so cold
it was like burning. I put out my hand
to touch his. He moved back. 
I don’t want to be sexual with you, he said. Everything gets crazy.
But now he was looking at me.
Yes, I said as I began to remove my clothes. 
Everything gets crazy. When nude
I turned my back because he likes the back.
He moved onto me. 
Everything I know about love and its necessities
I learned in that one moment
when I found myself 
thrusting my little burning red backside like a baboon
at a man who no longer cherished me.
There was no area of my mind 
not appalled by this action, no part of my body
that could have done otherwise.
But to talk of mind and body begs the question. 
Soul is the place,
stretched like a surface of millstone grit between body and mind,
where such necessity grinds itself out. 
Soul is what I kept watch on all that night.
Law stayed with me.
We lay on top of the covers as if it weren’t really a night of sleep and time, 
caressing and singing to one another in our made-up language
like the children we used to be.
That was a night that centred Heaven and Hell, 
as Emily would say. We tried to fuck
but he remained limp, although happy. I came
again and again, each time accumulating lucidity, 
until at last I was floating high up near the ceiling looking down
on the two souls clasped there on the bed
with their mortal boundaries 
visible around them like lines on a map.
I saw the lines harden.
He left in the morning. 
It is very cold
walking into the long scraped April wind.
At this time of year there is no sunset
just some movements inside the light and then a sinking away.  
KITCHEN 
Kitchen is quiet as a bone when I come in.
No sound from the rest of the house.
I wait a moment
then open the fridge. 
Brilliant as a spaceship it exhales cold confusion.
My mother lives alone and eats little but her fridge is always crammed.
After extracting the yogurt container 
from beneath a wily arrangement of leftover blocks of Christmas cake
wrapped in foil and prescription medicine bottles
I close the fridge door. Bluish dusk 
fills the room like a sea slid back.
I lean against the sink.
White foods taste best to me 
and I prefer to eat alone. I don’t know why.
Once I heard girls singing a May Day song that went: 
                                 Violante in the pantry
                                 Gnawing at a mutton bone
                                 How she gnawed it
                                 How she clawed it
                                 When she felt herself alone. 
Girls are cruelest to themselves.
Someone like Emily Brontë,
who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman, 
had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow.
We can see her ridding herself of it at various times
with a gesture like she used to brush the carpet. 
Reason with him and then whip him!
was her instruction (age six) to her father
regarding brother Branwell. 
And when she was 14 and bitten by a rabid dog she strode (they say)
into the kitchen and taking red hot tongs from the back of the stove applied
them directly to her arm. 
Cauterization of Heathcliff took longer.
More than thirty years in the time of the novel,
from the April evening when he runs out the back door of the kitchen
and vanishes over the moor 
because he overheard half a sentence of Catherine’s
(“It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff”)
until the wild morning 
when the servant finds him stark dead and grinning
on his rainsoaked bed upstairs in Wuthering Heights.
Heathcliff is a pain devil. 
If he had stayed in the kitchen
long enough to hear the other half of Catherine’s sentence
(“so he will never know how I love him”) 
Heathcliff would have been set free.
But Emily knew how to catch a devil.
She put into him in place of a soul 
the constant cold departure of Catherine from his nervous system
every time he drew a breath or moved thought.
She broke all his moments in half, 
with the kitchen door standing open.
I am not unfamiliar with this half-life.
But there is more to it than that. 
Heathcliff’s sexual despair
arose out of no such experience in the life of Emily Brontë,
so far as we know. Her question, 
which concerns the years of inner cruelty that can twist a person into a pain
    devil,
came to her in a kindly firelit kitchen
(“kichin” in Emily’s spelling) where she 
and Charlotte and Anne peeled potatoes together
and made up stories with the old house dog Keeper at their feet.
There is a fragment 
of a poem she wrote in 1839
(about six years before Wuthering Heights) that says: 
                            That iron man was born like me
                            And he was once an ardent boy:
                            He must have felt in infancy
                            The glory of a summer sky. 
Who is the iron man?
My mother’s voice cuts across me,
from the next room where she is lying on the sofa. 
Is that you dear?
Yes Ma.
Why don’t you turn on a light in there? 
Out the kitchen window I watch the steely April sun
jab its last cold yellow streaks
across a dirty silver sky.
Okay Ma. What’s for supper?  
LIBERTY 
Liberty means different things to different people.
I have never liked lying in bed in the morning.
Law did.
My mother does. 
But as soon as the morning light hits my eyes I want to be out in it—
moving along the moor
into the first blue currents and cold navigation of everything awake. 
I hear my mother in the next room turn and sigh and sink deeper.
I peel the stale cage of sheets off my legs
and I am free. 
Out on the moor all is brilliant and hard after a night of frost.
The light plunges straight up from the ice to a blue hole at the top of the sky.
Frozen mud crunches underfoot. The sound 
startles me back into the dream I was having
this morning when I awoke,
one of those nightlong sweet dreams of lying in Law’s 
arms like a needle in water—it is a physical effort
to pull myself out of his white silk hands
as they slide down my dream hips—I 
turn and face into the wind
and begin to run.
Goblins, devils and death stream behind me. 
In the days and months after Law left
I felt as if the sky was torn off my life.
I had no home in goodness anymore. 
To see the love between Law and me
turn into two animals gnawing and craving through one another
towards some other hunger was terrible. 
Perhaps this is what people mean by original sin, I thought.
But what love could be prior to it?
What is prior? 
What is love?
My questions were not original.
Nor did I answer them. 
Mornings when I meditated
I was presented with a nude glimpse of my lone soul,
not the complex mysteries of love and hate. 
But the Nudes are still as clear in my mind
as pieces of laundry that froze on the clothesline overnight.
There were in all thirteen of them. 
Nude #2. Woman caught in a cage of thorns.
Big glistening brown thorns with black stains on them
where she twists this way and that way 
unable to stand upright.
Nude #3. Woman with a single great thorn implanted in her forehead.
She grips it in both hands 
endeavouring to wrench it out.
Nude #4. Woman on a blasted landscape
backlit in red like Hieronymus Bosch. 
Covering her head and upper body is a hellish contraption
like the top half of a crab.
With arms crossed as if pulling off a sweater 
she works hard at dislodging the crab.
It was about this time
I began telling Dr. Haw 
about the Nudes. She said,
When you see these horrible images why do you stay with them?
Why keep watching? Why not 
go away? I was amazed.
Go away where? I said.
This still seems to me a good question. 
But by now the day is wide open and a strange young April light
is filling the moor with gold milk.
I have reached the middle 
where the ground goes down into a depression and fills with swampy water.
It is frozen.
A solid black pane of moor life caught in its own night attitudes. 
Certain wild gold arrangements of weed are visible deep in the black.
Four naked alder trunks rise straight up from it
and sway in the blue air. Each trunk 
where it enters the ice radiates a map of silver pressures—
thousands of hair-thin cracks catching the white of the light
like a jailed face 
catching grins through the bars.
Emily Brontë has a poem about a woman in jail who says 
                A messenger of Hope, comes every night to me
                And offers, for short life, eternal Liberty. 
I wonder what kind of Liberty this is.
Her critics and commentators say she means death
or a visionary experience that prefigures death. 
They understand her prison
as the limitations placed on a clergyman’s daughter
by nineteenth-century life in a remote parish on a cold moor 
in the north of England.
They grow impatient with the extreme terms in which she figures prison life.
“In so much of Brontë’s work 
the self-dramatising and posturing of these poems teeters
on the brink of a potentially bathetic melodrama,”
says one. Another 
refers to “the cardboard sublime” of her caught world.
I stopped telling my psychotherapist about the Nudes
when I realized I had no way to answer her question, 
Why keep watching?
Some people watch, that’s all I can say.
There is nowhere else to go, 
no ledge to climb up to.
Perhaps I can explain this to her if I wait for the right moment,
as with a very difficult sister. 
“On that mind time and experience alone could work:
to the influence of other intellects it was not amenable,”
wrote Charlotte of Emily. 
I wonder what kind of conversation these two had
over breakfast at the parsonage.
“My sister Emily 
was not a person of demonstrative character,” Charlotte emphasizes,
“nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings,
even those nearest and dearest to her could, 
with impunity, intrude unlicensed. . . .” Recesses were many.
One autumn day in 1845 Charlotte
“accidentally lighted on a MS. volume of verse in my sister Emily’s   
    handwriting.” 
It was a small (4 x 6) notebook
with a dark red cover marked 6d.
and contained 44 poems in Emily’s minute hand. 
Charlotte had known Emily wrote verse
but felt “more than surprise” at its quality.
“Not at all like the poetry women generally write.” 
Further surprise awaited Charlotte when she read Emily’s novel,
not least for its foul language.
She gently probes this recess 
in her Editor’s Preface to Wuthering Heights.
“A large class of readers, likewise, will suffer greatly
from the introduction into the pages of this work 
of words printed with all their letters,
which it has become the custom to represent by the initial and final letter
    only—a blank
line filling the interval.” 
Well, there are different definitions of Liberty.
Love is freedom, Law was fond of saying.
I took this to be more a wish than a thought 
and changed the subject.
But blank lines do not say nothing.
As Charlotte puts it, 
“The practice of hinting by single letters those expletives
with which profane and violent persons are wont to garnish their discourse,
strikes me as a proceeding which, 
however well meant, is weak and futile.
I cannot tell what good it does—what feeling it spares—
what horror it conceals.” 
I turn my steps and begin walking back over the moor
towards home and breakfast. It is a two-way traffic, 
the language of the unsaid. My favourite pages
of The Collected Works Of Emily Brontë
are the notes at the back 
recording small adjustments made by Charlotte
to the text of Emily’s verse,
which Charlotte edited for publication after Emily’s death.
“Prison for strongest [in Emily’s hand] altered to lordly by Charlotte.”  
HERO 
I can tell by the way my mother chews her toast
whether she had a good night
and is about to say a happy thing
or not. 
Not.
She puts her toast down on the side of her plate.
You know you can pull the drapes in that room, she begins.  
This is a coded reference to one of our oldest arguments,
from what I call The Rules Of Life series.
My mother always closes her bedroom drapes tight before going to bed at night. 
I open mine as wide as possible.
I like to see everything, I say.
What’s there to see? 
Moon. Air. Sunrise.
All that light on your face in the morning. Wakes you up.
I like to wake up. 
At this point the drapes argument has reached a delta
and may advance along one of three channels.
There is the What You Need Is A Good Night’s Sleep channel, 
the Stubborn As Your Father channel
and random channel.
More toast? I interpose strongly, pushing back my chair. 
Those women! says my mother with an exasperated rasp.
Mother has chosen random channel.
Women? 
Complaining about rape all the time
I see she is tapping one furious finger on yesterday’s newspaper
lying beside the grape jam. 
The front page has a small feature
about a rally for International Women’s Day—
have you had a look at the Sears Summer Catalogue? 
Nope.
Why, it’s a disgrace! Those bathing suits—
cut way up to here! (she points) No wonder! 
You’re saying women deserve to get raped
because Sears bathing suit ads
have high-cut legs? Ma, are you serious? 
Well someone has to be responsible.
Why should women be responsible for male desire? My voice is high.
Oh I see you’re one of Them. 
One of Whom? My voice is very high. Mother vaults it.
And whatever did you do with that little tank suit you had last year the green
    one?
It looked so smart on you. 
The frail fact drops on me from a great height
that my mother is afraid.
She will be eighty years old this summer. 
Her tiny sharp shoulders hunched in the blue bathrobe
make me think of Emily Brontë’s little merlin hawk Hero
that she fed bits of bacon at the kitchen table when Charlotte wasn‘t around. 
So Ma, we’ll go—I pop up the toaster
and toss a hot slice of pumpernickel lightly across onto her plate—
visit Dad today? She eyes the kitchen clock with hostility. 
Leave at eleven, home again by four? I continue.
She is buttering her toast with jagged strokes.
Silence is assent in our code. I go into the next room to phone the taxi. 
My father lives in a hospital for patients who need chronic care
about 50 miles from here.
He suffers from a kind of dementia 
characterized by two sorts of pathological change
first recorded in 1907 by Alois Alzheimer.
First, the presence in cerebral tissue 
of a spherical formation known as neuritic plaque,
consisting mainly of degenerating brain cells.
Second, neurofibrillary snarlings 
in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus.
There is no known cause or cure.
Mother visits him by taxi once a week 
for the last five years.
Marriage is for better or for worse, she says,
this is the worse. 
So about an hour later we are in the taxi
shooting along empty country roads towards town.
The April light is clear as an alarm. 
As we pass them it gives a sudden sense of every object
existing in space on its own shadow.
I wish I could carry this clarity with me 
into the hospital where distinctions tend to flatten and coalesce.
I wish I had been nicer to him before he got crazy.
These are my two wishes. 
It is hard to find the beginning of dementia.
I remember a night about ten years ago
when I was talking to him on the telephone. 
It was a Sunday night in winter.
I heard his sentences filling up with fear.
He would start a sentence—about weather, lose his way, start another.
It made me furious to hear him floundering— 
my tall proud father, former World War II navigator!
It made me merciless.
I stood on the edge of the conversation, 
watching him thrash about for cues,
offering none,
and it came to me like a slow avalanche 
that he had no idea who he was talking to.
Much colder today I guess. . . .
his voice pressed into the silence and broke off, 
snow falling on it.
There was a long pause while snow covered us both.
Well I won’t keep you, 
he said with sudden desperate cheer as if sighting land.
I’ll say goodnight now,
I won’t run up your bill. Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Who are you?
I said into the dial tone. 
At the hospital we pass down long pink halls
through a door with a big window
and a combination lock (5—25—3) 
to the west wing, for chronic care patients.
Each wing has a name.
The chronic wing is Our Golden Mile 
although mother prefers to call it The Last Lap.
Father sits strapped in a chair which is tied to the wall
in a room of other tied people tilting at various angles. 
My father tilts least, I am proud of him.
Hi Dad how y’doing?
His face cracks open it could be a grin or rage 
and looking past me he issues a stream of vehemence at the air.
My mother lays her hand on his.
Hello love, she says. He jerks his hand away. We sit. 
Sunlight flocks through the room.
Mother begins to unpack from her handbag the things she has brought for him,
grapes, arrowroot biscuits, humbugs. 
He is addressing strenuous remarks to someone in the air between us.
He uses a language known only to himself,
made of snarls and syllables and sudden wild appeals. 
Once in a while some old formula floats up through the wash—
You don’t say! or Happy birthday to you!—
but no real sentence 
for more than three years now.
I notice his front teeth are getting black.
I wonder how you clean the teeth of mad people. 
He always took good care of his teeth. My mother looks up.
She and I often think two halves of one thought.
Do you remember that gold-plated toothpick 
you sent him from Harrod’s the summer you were in London? she asks.
Yes I wonder what happened to it.
Must be in the bathroom somewhere. 
She is giving him grapes one by one.
They keep rolling out of his huge stiff fingers.
He used to be a big man, over six feet tall and strong, 
but since he came to hospital his body has shrunk to the merest bone house—
except the hands. The hands keep growing.
Each one now as big as a boot in Van Gogh, 
they go lumbering after the grapes in his lap.
But now he turns to me with a rush of urgent syllables
that break off on a high note—he waits, 
staring into my face. That quizzical look.
One eyebrow at an angle.
I have a photograph taped to my fridge at home. 
It shows his World War II air crew posing in front of the plane.
Hands firmly behind backs, legs wide apart,
chins forward. 
Dressed in the puffed flying suits
with a wide leather strap pulled tight through the crotch.
They squint into the brilliant winter sun of 1942. 
It is dawn.
They are leaving Dover for France.
My father on the far left is the tallest airman, 
with his collar up,
one eyebrow at an angle.
The shadowless light makes him look immortal, 
for all the world like someone who will not weep again.
He is still staring into my face.
Flaps down! I cry.
His black grin flares once and goes out like a match.  
HOT 
Hot blue moonlight down the steep sky.
I wake too fast from a cellar of hanged puppies
with my eyes pouring into the dark.
Fumbling 
and slowly
consciousness replaces the bars.
Dreamtails and angry liquids 
swim back down to the middle of me.
It is generally anger dreams that occupy my nights now.
This is not uncommon after loss of love— 
blue and black and red blasting the crater open.
I am interested in anger.
I clamber along to find the source. 
My dream was of an old woman lying awake in bed.
She controls the house by a system of light bulbs strung above her on wires.
Each wire has a little black switch. 
One by one the switches refuse to turn the bulbs on.
She keeps switching and switching
in rising tides of very hot anger. 
Then she creeps out of bed to peer through lattices
at the rooms of the rest of the house.
The rooms are silent and brilliantly lit 
and full of huge furniture beneath which crouch
small creatures—not quite cats not quite rats
licking their narrow red jaws 
under a load of time.
I want to be beautiful again, she whispers
but the great overlit rooms tick emptily 
as a deserted oceanliner and now behind her in the dark
a rustling sound, comes—
My pajamas are soaked. 
Anger travels through me, pushes aside everything else in my heart,
pouring up the vents.
Every night I wake to this anger, 
the soaked bed,
the hot pain box slamming me each way I move.
I want justice. Slam. 
I want an explanation. Slam.
I want to curse the false friend who said I love you forever. Slam.
I reach up and switch on the bedside lamp. Night springs 
out the window and is gone over the moor.
I lie listening to the light vibrate in my ears
and thinking about curses. 
Emily Brontë was good at cursing.
Falsity and bad love and the deadly pain of alteration are constant topics in
    her verse. 
                     Well, thou halt paid me back my love!
                     But if there be a God above
                     Whose arm is strong, whose word is true,
                     This hell shall wring thy spirit too! 
The curses are elaborate: 
            There go, Deceiver, go! My hand is streaming wet;
            My heart’s blood flows to buy the blessing—To forget!
            Oh could that lost heart give back, back again to thine,
            One tenth part of the pain that clouds my dark decline! 
But they do not bring her peace: 
       Vain words, vain frenzied thoughts! No ear can hear me call—
       Lost in the vacant air my frantic curses fall. . . . 
       Unconquered in my soul the Tyrant rules me still—
       Life bows to my control, but Love I cannot kill! 
Her anger is a puzzle.
It raises many questions in me,
to see love treated with such cold and knowing contempt 
by someone who rarely left home
“except to go to church or take a walk on the hills”
(Charlotte tells us) and who 
had no more intercourse with Haworth folk
than “a nun has
of the country people who sometimes pass her convent gates.” 
How did Emily come to lose faith in humans?
She admired their dialects, studied their genealogies,
“but with them she rarely exchanged a word.” 
Her introvert nature shrank from shaking hands with someone she met on the moor.
What did Emily know of lover’s lies or cursive human faith?
Among her biographers 
is one who conjectures she bore or aborted a child
during her six-month stay in Halifax,
but there is no evidence at all for such an event 
and the more general consensus is that Emily did not touch a man in her 31
    years.
Banal sexism aside,
I find myself tempted 
to read Wuthering Heights as one thick stacked act of revenge
for all that life withheld from Emily.
But the poetry shows traces of a deeper explanation. 
As if anger could be a kind of vocation for some women.
It is a chilly thought.
                           
                              The heart is dead since infancy.
                              Unwept for let the body go. 
Suddenly cold I reach down and pull the blanket back up to my chin.
The vocation of anger is not mine.
I know my source. 
It is stunning, it is a moment like no other,
when one’s lover comes in and says I do not love you anymore.
I switch off the lamp and lie on my back, 
thinking about Emily’s cold young soul.
Where does unbelief begin?
When I was young 
there were degrees of certainty.
I could say, Yes I know that I have two hands.
Then one day I awakened on a planet of people whose hands occasionally   
    disappear— 
From the next room I hear my mother shift and sigh and settle
back down under the doorsill of sleep.
Out the window the moon is just a cold bit of silver gristle low on fading banks
    of sky. 
          Our guests are darkly lodged, I whispered, gazing through
          The vault . . .  
THOU 
The question I am left with is the question of her loneliness.
And I prefer to put it off.
It is morning. 
Astonished light is washing over the moor from north to east.
I am walking into the light.
One way to put off loneliness is to interpose God. 
Emily had a relationship on this level with someone she calls Thou. She describes Thou as awake like herself all night
and full of strange power. 
Thou woos Emily with a voice that comes out of the night wind.
Thou and Emily influence one another in the darkness,
playing near and far at once. 
She talks about a sweetness that “proved us one.”
I am uneasy with the compensatory model of female religious experience and yet,
there is no question, 
it would be sweet to have a friend to tell things to at night,
without the terrible sex price to pay.
This is a childish idea, I know. 
My education, I have to admit, has been gappy.
The basic rules of male-female relations
were imparted atmospherically in our family, 
no direct speech allowed.
I remember one Sunday I was sitting in the backseat of the car.
Father in front. 
We were waiting in the driveway for mother,
who came around the corner of the house
and got into the passenger side of the car 
dressed in a yellow Chanel suit and black high heels.
Father glanced sideways at her.
Showing a good bit of leg today Mother, he said 
in a voice which I (age eleven) thought odd.
I stared at the back of her head waiting for what she would say.
Her answer would clear this up. 
But she just laughed a strange laugh with ropes all over it.
Later that summer I put this laugh together with another laugh
I overheard as I was going upstairs. 
She was talking on the telephone in the kitchen.
Well a woman would be just as happy with a kiss on the cheek
most of the time but YOU KNOW MEN, 
she was saying. Laugh.
Not ropes, thorns.
I have arrived at the middle of the moor 
where the ground goes down into a low swampy place.
The swamp water is frozen solid.
Bits of gold weed 
have etched themselves
on the underside of the ice like messages. 
                        I’ll come when thou art saddest,
                        Laid alone in the darkened room;
                        When the mad day’s mirth has vanished,
                        And the smile of joy is banished, 
                         I’ll come when the heart’s real feeling
                         Has entire, unbiased sway,
                         And my influence o’er thee stealing
                         Grief deepening, joy congealing,
                         Shall bear thy soul away. 
                         Listen! ’tis just the hour,
                         The awful time for thee:
                         Dost thou not feel upon thy soul
                         A flood of strange sensations roll,
                         Forerunners of a sterner power,
                         Heralds of me? 
Very hard to read, the messages that pass
between Thou and Emily.
In this poem she reverses their roles, 
speaking not as the victim but to the victim.
It is chilling to watch Thou move upon thou,
who lies alone in the dark waiting to be mastered. 
It is a shock to realize that this low, slow collusion
of master and victim within one voice
is a rationale 
for the most awful loneliness of the poet’s hour.
She has reversed the roles of thou and Thou
not as a display of power 
but to force out of herself some pity
for this soul trapped in glass,
which is her true creation. 
Those nights lying alone
are not discontinuous with this cold hectic dawn.
It is who I am. 
Is it a vocation of anger?
Why construe silence
as the Real Presence? 
Why stoop to kiss this doorstep?
Why be unstrung and pounded flat and pine away
imagining someone vast to whom I may vent the swell of my soul? 
Emily was fond of Psalm 130.
“My soul waiteth on Thou more than they that watch for the morning,
I say more than they that watch for the morning.” 
I like to believe that for her the act of watching provided a shelter, 
that her collusion with Thou gave ease to anger and desire:
”In Thou they are quenched as a fire of thorns,“ says the psalmist. 
But for myself I do not believe this, I am not quenched—
with Thou or without Thou I find no shelter.
I am my own Nude. 
And Nudes have a difficult sexual destiny.
I have watched this destiny disclose itself
in its jerky passage from girl to woman to who I am now, 
from love to anger to this cold marrow,
from fire to shelter to fire.
What is the opposite of believing in Thou— 
merely not believing in Thou? No. That is too simple.
That is to prepare a misunderstanding.
I want to speak more clearly. 
Perhaps the Nudes are the best way.
Nude #5. Deck of cards.
Each card is made of flesh. 
The living cards are days of a woman’s life.
I see a great silver needle go flashing right through the deck once from end to
    end.
Nude #6 I cannot remember. 
Nude #7. White room whose walls,
having neither planes nor curves nor angles,
are composed of a continuous satiny white membrane 
like the flesh of some interior organ of the moon.
It is a living surface, almost wet.
Lucency breathes in and out. 
Rainbows shudder across it.
And around the walls of the room a voice goes whispering, Be very careful. Be very careful. 
Nude #8. Black disc on which the fires of all the winds
are attached in a row.
A woman stands on the disc 
amid the winds whose long yellow silk flames
flow and vibrate up through her.
Nude #9. Transparent loam. 
Under the loam a woman has dug a long deep trench.
Into the trench she is placing small white forms, I don’t know what they are.
Nude #10. Green thorn of the world poking up 
alive through the heart of a woman
who lies on her back on the ground.
The thorn is exploding 
its green blood above her in the air. Everything it is it has, the voice says.
Nude #11. Ledge in outer space. 
Space is bluish black and glossy as solid water
and moving very fast in all directions,
shrieking past the woman who stands pinned 
to nothing by its pressure.
She peers and glances for some way to go, trying to lift her hand but cannot.
Nude #12. Old pole in the wind. 
Cold currents are streaming over it
and pulling out
into ragged long horizontal black lines 
some shreds of ribbon
attached to the pole.
I cannot see how they are attached— 
notches? staples? nails? All of a sudden the wind changes
and all the black shreds rise straight up in the air
and tie themselves into knots, 
then untie and float down.
The wind is gone.
It waits. 
By this time, midway through winter,
I had become entirely fascinated with my spiritual melodrama.
Then it stopped. 
Days passed, months passed and I saw nothing.
I continued to peer and glance, sitting on the rug in front of my sofa
in the curtainless morning 
with my nerves open to the air like something skinned.
I saw nothing.
Outside the window spring storms came and went. 
April snow folded its huge white paws over doors and porches.
I watched a chunk of it lean over the roof and break off
and fall and I thought, 
How slow! as it glided soundlessly past,
but still—nothing. No nudes.
No Thou. 
A great icicle formed on the railing of my balcony
so I drew up close to the window and tried peering through the icicle,
hoping to trick myself into some interior vision, 
but all I saw
was the man and woman in the room across the street
making their bed and laughing. 
I stopped watching.
I forgot about Nudes.
I lived my life, 
which felt like a switched-off TV.
Something had gone through me and out and I could not own it.
“No need now to tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind. 
Emily does not feel them,”
wrote Charlotte the day after burying her sister.
Emily had shaken free. 
A soul can do that.
Whether it goes to join Thou and sit on the porch for all eternity
enjoying jokes and kisses and beautiful cold spring evenings, 
you and I will never know. But I can tell you what I saw.
Nude #13 arrived when I was not watching for it.
It came at night. 
Very much like Nude #1.
And yet utterly different.
I saw a high hill and on it a form shaped against hard air. 
It could have been just a pole with some old cloth attached,
but as I came closer
I saw it was a human body 
trying to stand against winds so terrible that the flesh was blowing off the bones.
And there was no pain.
The wind 
was cleansing the bones.
They stood forth silver and necessary.
It was not my body, not a woman’s body, it was the body of us all.
It walked out of the light.

The man with the red hat
And the polar bear, is he here too?   
The window giving on shade,   
Is that here too?
And all the little helps,
My initials in the sky,
The hay of an arctic summer night? 
The bear
Drops dead in sight of the window.
Lovely tribes have just moved to the north.
In the flickering evening the martins grow denser.   
Rivers of wings surround us and vast tribulation.

A glimpse through an interstice caught,Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove late of a winter night, and I unremark’d seated in a corner,Of a youth who loves me and whom I love, silently approaching and seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand,A long while amid the noises of coming and going, of drinking and oath and smutty jest,There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little, perhaps not a word.


^^EOP^^

Upon a bank, easeless with knobs of gold, 
 Beneath a canopy of noonday smoke,I saw a measureless Beast, morose and bold,
 With eyes like one from filthy dreams awoke, Who stares upon the daylight in despair For very terror of the nothing there.
This beast in one flat hand clutched vulture-wise 
 A glittering image of itself in jet,And with the other groped about its eyes
 To drive away the dreams that pestered it; And never ceased its coils to toss and beat The mire encumbering its feeble feet.
Sharp was its hunger, though continually
 It seemed a cud of stones to ruminate, And often like a dog let glittering lie
 This meatless fare, its foolish gaze to sate; Once more convulsively to stoop its jaw, Or seize the morsel with an envious paw.
Indeed, it seemed a hidden enemy
 Must lurk within the clouds above that bank,It strained so wildly its pale, stubborn eye,
 To pierce its own foul vapours dim and dank; Till, wearied out, it raved in wrath and foam, Daring that Nought Invisible to come.
Ay, and it seemed some strange delight to find 
 In this unmeaning din, till, suddenly, As if it heard a rumour on the wind,
 Or far away its freer children cry,Lifting its face made-quiet, there it stayed, Till died the echo its own rage had made.
That place alone was barren where it lay;
 Flowers bloomed beyond, utterly sweet and fair; And even its own dull heart might think to stay 
 In livelong thirst of a clear river there,Flowing from unseen hills to unheard seas, Through a still vale of yew and almond trees.
And then I spied in the lush green below
 Its tortured belly, One, like silver, pale, With fingers closed upon a rope of straw,
 That bound the Beast, squat neck to hoary tail; Lonely in all that verdure faint and deep, He watched the monster as a shepherd sheep.
I marvelled at the power, strength, and rage
 Of this poor creature in such slavery bound; Fettered with worms of fear; forlorn with age;
 Its blue wing-stumps stretched helpless on the ground; While twilight faded into darkness deep, And he who watched it piped its pangs asleep.

In his malodorous brain what slugs and mire,Lanthorned in his oblique eyes, guttering burned!His body lodged a rat where men nursed souls.The world flashed grape-green eyes of a foiled catTo him. On fragments of an old shrunk power,On shy and maimed, on women wrung awry,He lay, a bullying hulk, to crush them more.But when one, fearless, turned and clawed like bronze,Cringing was easy to blunt these stern paws,And he would weigh the heavier on those after.
Who rests in God’s mean flattery now? Your wealthIs but his cunning to make death more hard.Your iron sinews take more pain in breaking.And he has made the market for your beautyToo poor to buy, although you die to sell.Only that he has never heard of sleep;And when the cats come out the rats are sly.Here we are safe till he slinks in at dawn
But he has gnawed a fibre from strange roots,And in the morning some pale wonder ceases.Things are not strange and strange things are forgetful.Ah! if the day were arid, somehow lostOut of us, but it is as hair of us,And only in the hush no wind stirs it.And in the light vague trouble lifts and breathes,And restlessness still shadows the lost ways.The fingers shut on voices that pass through,Where blind farewells are taken easily ....
Ah! this miasma of a rotting God!

When they confess that they have lost the penial bone and outer space is
Once again a numinous void, when they’re kept out of Other Places,
And Dr Fieser falls asleep at last and dreams of unburnt faces,
When gold medals are won by the ton for forgetting about the different races,  God Bless America.   
When in the Latin shanties the scented priesthood suffers metempsychosis
And with an organ entry tutti copula the dollar uncrosses
Itself and abdicates, when the Pax Americana cuts its losses
And a Pinkville memorial’s built in furious shame by Saigon’s puppet bosses,  God Bless America.   
When they can be happy without noise, without knowing where on earth they’ve been,
When they cease to be intellectual tourists and stop wanting to be clean,
When they send their children to bed at the proper time and say just what they mean,
And no longer trust the Quarterly Symposium and the Vicarious Screen,  God Bless America.   
When they feel thoroughly desolated by the short-haired Christ they pray to,
When they weep over their plunder of Europe stone by stone, releasing Plato
And other Freshman Great Books, when they switch off their Hoover and unplug Nato,
Pulling the chain on the CIA and awarding Time a rotten potato,  God Bless America.   
When qua-birds, quickhatches and quinnets agree at last to admit the quail,
When Captain Queeg is seen descending from the bridge as small and pale
As everyone else, and is helped with sympathetic murmurs to the rail,
When the few true defenders of love and justice survive to tell the tale,  Then, perhaps then, God Bless America.

We have been cruising, half a block
at a time, my wife, my two children,
all morning, and I have been pointing out
unhurriedly and with some feeling
places of consequence, sacred places,
backyards, lush fields, garages, alleyways.
“There,” I say, “by this big cottonwood,
That’s where I dropped the fly ball, 1959.”
“And in 1961,” I say, “at this very corner,
Barry Sapolsky tripped me up with his gym bag.”
My son has fallen asleep, my daughter
has been nodding “yes” indiscriminately
for the last half hour, and my wife
has the frozen, wide-eyed look of the undead.
“Maybe lunch,” I say, though I’m making now
my fourth approach to Curtin Jr. High School,
yellow-bricked, large-windowed, gothic,
where Frank Marone preyed on our terror once
and Janice Lehman walked in beauty.
“Salute, everyone,” I say, “salute,”
bringing my hand up to my brow as we pass
the gilded entrance, “This is where things
of importance happened,” and I am pulling out
from under the car seat a photo album
of old school pictures, “Page 8,” I say,
“Fred Decker, John Carlson by the bike rack,
Mr. Burkett … ,” and driving on, following
the invisible map before my eyes.
Now we are drifting toward my boyhood house
and I am showing my wife trellised porches,
bike routes, more than she’d care to see;
“Why this longing?” she says, “What about now,
the kids, our lives together, lunch, me?”
I give her a kiss and turn right on Cherry
and there in front of our eyes, barely changed,
is the house where all my memories converge.
“Look at the windows of my room,” I say,
“see, there, the shadowy figure moving behind them?”
And before anyone can hope to answer,
I have grabbed my camera, I am snapping
pictures through the windshield, bricks,
dormers, railings, fences, streets, all
are falling thrall to my aim.
“We could be happy here,” I say, putting
another roll of film in and beginning
to nose my car toward Bill Corson’s house.
“Really, Daddy,” my daughter says; “No chance,”
my wife tacks on, but all I’m hearing
is the crack of bats in the neighborhood lot
and Danny’s pearl-handled cap gun going off
and the drone of bees around honeysuckle
and Dewey Waugh’s gravelly voice
urging on his mower, and the sound
of wind in the cottonwoods is like water,
I am coasting, there is time for everything.


^^EOP^^

Even in fortunate times,
The nectar is spiked with woe.
Gods are incorrigibly
Capricious, and the needy
Beg in Nineveh or sleep
In paper-gusting plazas
Of the New World’s shopping malls. 
Meantime, the tyrant battens
On conquest, while advisers,
Angling for preferment, seek
Expedient paths. Heartbroken,
The faithful advocate looks
Back on cities of the plain
And trudges into exile. 
And if any era thrives,
It’s only because, somewhere,
In a plane tree’s shade, friends sketch
The dust with theorems and proofs,
Or because, instinctively,
A man puts his arm around
The shoulder of grief and walks
It (for an hour or an age)
Through all its tears and telling.


^^EOP^^

Fetch? Balls and sticks capture my attention
seconds at a time. Catch? I don’t think so.
Bunny, tumbling leaf, a squirrel who’s—oh
joy—actually scared. Sniff the wind, then 
I’m off again: muck, pond, ditch, residue
of any thrillingly dead thing. And you?
Either you’re sunk in the past, half our walk,
thinking of what you never can bring back, 
or else you’re off in some fog concerning
—tomorrow, is that what you call it? My work:
to unsnare time’s warp (and woof!), retrieving,
my haze-headed friend, you. This shining bark, 
a Zen master’s bronzy gong, calls you here,
entirely, now: bow-wow, bow-wow, bow-wow.

I

To see my father
lying in pink velvet, a rosary   
twined around his hands, rouged,   
lipsticked, his skin marble ...

My mother said, “He looks the way he did   
thirty years ago, the day we got married,—
I’m glad I went;
I was afraid: now I can remember him   
like that ...”

Ruth, your last girlfriend, who wouldn’t sleep with you   
or marry, because you wanted her
to pay half the expenses, and “His drinking
almost drove me crazy—”
                                    Ruth once saw you
staring into a mirror,
in your ubiquitous kerchief and cowboy hat,
say:
       “Why can’t I look like a cowboy?”

You left a bag of money; and were   
the unhappiest man   
I have ever known well.


II

It’s in many ways
a relief to have you dead.
                                        I have more money.
Bakersfield is easier: life isn’t so nude,   
now that I no longer have to
face you each evening: mother is progressing   
beautifully in therapy, I can almost convince myself   
a good analyst would have saved you:

for I need to believe, as
always, that your pervasive sense of disappointment

proceeded from
trivial desires: but I fear
that beneath the wish to be a movie star,   
cowboy, empire builder, all those
cheap desires, lay
radical disaffection
                               from the very possibilities   
of human life ...

Your wishes were too simple:
                        or too complex.


III

I find it difficult to imagine you
in bed, making love to a woman ...

By common consensus, you were a good lover:   
and yet,
mother once said: “Marriage would be better   
if it weren’t mixed up with sex ...”

Just after the divorce,—when I was   
about five,—I slept all night with you

in a motel, and again and again   
you begged me
to beg her to come back ...

I said nothing; but she went back
several times, again and again
you would go on a binge, there would be   
another woman,
mother would leave ...

You always said,
“Your mother is the only woman I’ve ever loved.”


IV

Oh Shank, don’t turn into the lies   
of mere, neat poetry ...

I’ve been reading Jung, and he says that we can   
never get to the bottom   
of what is, or was ...

But why things were as they were   
obsesses; I know that you   
the necessity to contend with you
your helplessness
before yourself,
                        —has been at the center   
of how I think my life ...

                                        And yet your voice, raw,
demanding, dissatisfied,   
saying over the telephone:

               “How are all those bastards at Harvard?”

remains, challenging: beyond all the   
patterns and paradigms
                                  I use to silence and stop it.


V

I dreamed I had my wish:
                                    —I seemed to see
the conditions of my life, upon
a luminous stage: how I could change,   
how I could not: the root of necessity,   
and choice.
                  The stage was labelled   
“Insight”.
                The actors there
had no faces, I cannot remember   
the patterns of their actions, but   
simply by watching,

I knew that beneath my feet   
the fixed stars
governing my life

had begun to fall, and melt ...
                                                —Then your face appeared,

laughing at the simplicity of my wish.


VI

Almost every day
I take out the letter you wrote me in Paris.   
... Why?

It was written
the year before you married Shirley; Myrtle,   
your girlfriend, was an ally of mine
because she “took care of you,”
but you always
made it clear
she was too dumpy and crude to marry ...

In some ways “elegant,”
with a pencil-thin, neatly clipped moustache,   
chiselled, Roman nose, you were
a millionaire
and always pretended
you couldn’t afford to go to Europe ...

When I was a child,
you didn’t seem to care if I existed.

 
Bakersfield, Calif
 

July 9, 1961

Dear Pinon,
       Sorry I haven’t wrote to you sooner but glad to hear that you are well and enjoying Paris.
       I got your fathers day wire in the hospital where I put in about twelve days but I am very well now. I quit the ciggeretts but went through ten days of hell quitting and my back had been giving me hell.
       It had been very hot here but the last few days has been very nice. Emily just got out of the hospital yesterday. She had her feet worked on. I guess she will tell you about it. Glad to hear you are learning some French.
       We are just about through with potatoes. Crop was very good but no price at all which made it a poor year. Cattle are cheap too. It look like a bad year for all farmer’s.
       I don’t know anything else to tell you. Take care of your self and enjoy it. Maybe you will never have another chance for another trip. I don’t think I’ll ever get the chance to go, so if you run into a extra special gal between 28 & 35 send her over here to me as all I know over here don’t amount to mutch. Well I guess I’ll close now as I am going over to see Emily.
       Hoping to hear from you right away.
       This address is 4019 Eton St. be sure and get it straight. Myrtle would like to know how much that watch amounts to. Let us know   
       Will close now and write soon.

                                                    Love ‘Shank’

P.S. Excuse this writing as its about 30 years since I wrote a letter.


VII

How can I say this?
                              I think my psychiatrist   
likes me: he knows
the most terrible things I’ve done, every stupidity,   
inadequacy, awkwardness,
ignorance, the mad girl I screwed
because she once again and again
teased and rejected me, and whose psychic incompetence   
I grimly greeted as an occasion for revenge;   
he greets my voice

with an interest, and regard, and affection,   
which seem to signal I’m worth love;

—you finally
forgave me for being your son, and in the nasty   
shambles of your life, in which you had less and less   
occasion for pride, you were proud
of me, the first Bidart
who ever got a B.A.; Harvard, despite
your distrust, was the crown;—but the way   
you eyed me:
                   the bewilderment, unease:
the somehow always
tentative, suspended judgment ...

—however much you tried (and, clearly,   
you did try)
                   you could not remake your   
taste, and like me: could not remake   
yourself, to give me

the grace
needed to look in a mirror, as I often can   
now, with some equanimity ...


VIII

When did I begin to substitute   
insight, for prayer? ...

                                     —You believed in neither:   
but said, “My life is over,”
after you had married Shirley,
twenty-five years younger, with three
small children, the youngest
six months old; she was unfaithful
within two months, the marriage was simply   
annulled ...
                   A diabetic, you didn’t
take your insulin when you drank, and
almost managed to die
many times ...
                      You punished Ruth
when she went to Los Angeles for a weekend, by   
beginning to drink; she would return home   
either to find you in the hospital,
or in a coma on the floor ...

                                             The exacerbation   
of this seeming necessity
for connection—;
                         you and mother taught me   
there’s little that’s redemptive or useful
in natural affections ...
I must unlearn; I must believe

you were merely a man
with a character, and a past—;
                                              you wore them,   
                                              unexamined,
like a nimbus of
furies

round your
greying, awesome head ...


IX

What should I have done? In 1963,
you wanted to borrow ten thousand dollars   
from me, so that we could buy cattle   
together, under the name “Bidart and Son,”—
most of your money was tied up   
in the increasingly noxious “Bidart Brothers,”   
run by your brother, Johnny ...

I said no,
that I wanted to use the money
for graduate school; but I thought
if you went on a binge, and as had happened   
before, simply threw it away ...

The Bidarts agreed
you were not to be trusted; you accepted   
my answer, with an air
of inevitability I was shocked at ...

I didn’t want to see your self-disgust;   
—somehow, your self-congratulation   
had eroded more deeply, much
more deeply, than even I had wished,—

but for years, how I had wished! ...

I have a friend who says
that he has never felt a conflict
between something deeply wished or desired,   
and what he thought was “moral” ...

Father, such innocence
surely is a kind of Eden—; but,
somehow, I can’t regret that we
are banished from that company—;   
in the awareness, the
history of our contradictions and violence,   
insofar as I am “moral” at all,
is the beginning of my moral being.


X

When I began this poem,
                                    to see myself
as a piece of history, having a past
which shapes, and informs, and thus inevitably   
limits—
          at first this seemed sufficient, the beginning of   
freedom ...
                  The way to approach freedom
was to acknowledge necessity:—   
I sensed I had to become not merely
a speaker, the “eye,” but a character ...

And you had to become a character: with a past,   
with a set of internal contradictions and necessities   
which if I could once define, would at least   
begin to release us from each other ...

But, of course, no such knowledge is possible;—   
as I touch your photographs, they stare back at me   
with the dazzling, impenetrable, glitter of mere life ...

You stand smiling, at the end of the twenties,   
in a suit, and hat,
cane and spats, with a collie at your feet,   
happy to be handsome, dashing, elegant:—   

and though I cannot connect this image
with the end of your life, with the defensive   
gnarled would-be cowboy,—   

you seem happy at that fact, happy
to be surprising; unknowable; unpossessable ...

You say it’s what you always understood by freedom.
 
1968-69.

“Good morning, dear students,” the principal said.
“Please put down your pencils and go back to bed.
Today we will spend the day playing outside,
then take the whole school on a carnival ride. 
“We’ll learn to eat candy while watching TV,
then listen to records and swing from a tree.
We’ll also be learning to draw on the walls,
to scream in the classrooms and run in the halls. 
“So bring in your skateboard, your scooter, your bike.
It’s time to be different and do what you like.
The teachers are going to give you a rest.
You don’t have to study. There won’t be a test. 
“And if you’d prefer, for a bit of a change,
feel free to go wild and act really strange.
Go put on a clown suit and dye your hair green,
and copy your face on the Xerox machine. 
“Tomorrow it’s back to the regular grind.
Today, just go crazy. We really don’t mind.
So tear up your homework. We’ll give you an A.
Oh wait. I’m just kidding. It’s April Fools’ Day.”

Genial poets, pink-faced   
earnest wits—
you have given the world   
some choice morsels,
gobbets of language presented
as one presents T-bone steak
and Cherries Jubilee.   
Goodbye, goodbye,
                            I don’t care
if I never taste your fine food again,   
neutral fellows, seers of every side.   
Tolerance, what crimes
are committed in your name. 
And you, good women, bakers of nicest bread,   
blood donors. Your crumbs
choke me, I would not want
a drop of your blood in me, it is pumped   
by weak hearts, perfect pulses that never   
falter: irresponsive
to nightmare reality. 
It is my brothers, my sisters,
whose blood spurts out and stops
forever
because you choose to believe it is not your business. 
Goodbye, goodbye,
your poems
shut their little mouths,   
your loaves grow moldy,   
a gulf has split
                     the ground between us,
and you won’t wave, you’re looking
another way.
We shan’t meet again—
unless you leap it, leaving   
behind you the cherished   
worms of your dispassion,   
your pallid ironies,
your jovial, murderous,   
wry-humored balanced judgment,
leap over, un-
balanced? ... then
how our fanatic tears
would flow and mingle   
for joy ...

(dirt stolen from an infant’s grave around midnight)



Do not try to take it from my child’s grave, nor
from the grave
of my childhood,
nor from any infant’s grave I guard—voodoo, juju, boo-hoo rites
calling for it or not! This dust, this dirt, will not
be taken at dawn or noon
or at the dusky time,
and if you approach
this sacred place near midnight,
then I will chop,
one by one, your fingers off
with which you do your harm. Goofer-dust: if you want it,
if you need it, then
erect downwind from a baby’s grave
a fine-meshed net
and gather it
one-half grain, a flaky mote, an infinitesimally small fleck
of a flake at a time
and in such a way
it is given to you
by the day, the wind, the world,
it is given to you, thereby
diminishing the need to steal
this dirt displaced by a child
in a child’s grave.

Trailing her father, bearing his hand axe,
      the girl thought she had never
   guessed what earthly majesty
         was before 
then, as he strode unconcernedly
      holding a vicious gander
   by the horny mitts and let
         the big wings 
batter his knees. She was also surprised
      to feel a liberating
   satisfaction in the coming
         bloodshed, and 
that notwithstanding all the times she had
      been beleaguered and
   had fled, today she did not fear
         the barnyard hubub. 
Yet, as her father’s clever stroke fell, as
      the pronged head skipped sideways
   and the neck plumes stiffened with blood
         from the cleft, 
she was angry; and, when the headless goose
      ran to the brook and was
   carried off into the woods alive,
         she rejoiced, 
and subsequently frequented those woods
      and avoided her father.
   When the goose began to mend she
         brought him small 
hominy, which was welcome though she had
      to press the kernels one
   by one into the pink neck that
         throbbed into 
her palm; when haemorrhage occurred she would
      not spare handkerchiefs,
   and stanching the spot she felt a thrill
         of sympathy. 
But for the most part there was steady progress,
      and growing vigor was
   accompanied by restlessness,
         and one cool day 
the blind thing was batted out of existence
      by a motorcycle.
   She had no time for tears. She ran
         upstairs to miss 
her father’s barytone commiseration,
      then out onto the fields,
   and, holding an old red pinwheel,
         ran ran ran ran.

Goya drew a pig on a wall.
The five-year-old hairdresser’s son
Saw, graved on a silver tray,
The lion; and sunsets were begun. 
Goya smelt the bull-fight blood.
The pupil of the Carmelite
Gave his hands to a goldsmith, learned
To gild an aureole aright. 
Goya saw the Puzzel’s eyes:
Sang in the street (with a guitar)
And climbed the balcony; but Keats
(Under the halyards) wrote ‘Bright star.’ 
Goya saw the Great Slut pick
The chirping human puppets up,
And laugh, with pendulous mountain lip,
And drown them in a coffee cup; 
Or squeeze their little juices out
In arid hands, insensitive,
To make them gibber . . . Goya went
Among the catacombs to live. 
He saw gross Ronyons of the air,
Harelipped and goitered, raped in flight
By hairless pimps, umbrella-winged:
Tumult above Madrid at night. 
He heard the seconds in his clock
Crack like seeds, divulge, and pour
Abysmal filth of Nothingness
Between the pendulum and the floor: 
Torrents of dead veins, rotted cells,
Tonsils decayed, and fingernails:
Dead hair, dead fur, dead claws, dead skin:
Nostrils and lids; and cauls and veils; 
And eyes that still, in death, remained
(Unlidded and unlashed) aware
Of the foul core, and, fouler yet,
The region worm that ravins there. 
Stench flowed out of the second’s tick.
And Goya swam with it through Space,
Sweating the fetor from his limbs,
And stared upon the unfeatured face 
That did not see, and sheltered naught,
But was, and is. The second gone,
Goya returned, and drew the face;
And scrawled beneath it, ‘This I have known’ . . . 
And drew four slatterns, in an attic,
Heavy, with heads on arms, asleep:
And underscribed it, ‘Let them slumber,
Who, if they woke, could only weep’ . . .

My father had several times expressed a fear of being
buried alive. I insisted that the doctor should do whatever
was necessary. The doctor asked me to leave the
room. When I came back, he was able to assure me that
Renoir was dead!

jean renoir



It is not 1937 for long. A clump of ash trees and a walk
Down the the boathouse: inside linen is tacked up
In a long blank mural; the children sit on the wings
Of the dry dock, and then, over the water in a circle
Of rowboats, the aunts and uncles wait while
At their center the projectionist, Jean Renoir,
On a cedar raft, casts silhouettes of rabbits, birds,
And turtles for the sleepy children. Corks
Come out of old bottles, it is a few minutes past sunset
And, now, a swimmer beside the raft looks 
Into the boathouse to the linens: at last, it is 1915!
A bird screams over the lake, two bats
Flitter back and forth through the beam of the lamp,
Interrupting the images, the grand illusion, cast over
Water the the acceptance of white tablecloths
On the darkening shore of the lake. A torch is lit
For its kerosene smoke is repugnant to the swarming insects.
This film and its prisoners exist between extreme borders,
Not music and algebra but
A war and, then, yet another war. . . 
But we begin with the captured officers digging
A tunnel that will soon be outside the garden wall.
The Boches observe the Frenchmen working
With their hoes as from the trousers of a boy
Dirt from the tunnel secretly spills onto horse manure!
The prisoners dream of crossing a meadow filled
With snow, in the moonlight it is jade-green snow
While Germans with rifles on a hill
Are unable to kill them, for they have escaped
Into Switzerland with its feather-brushed trees 
And patina of copper rooftops along a hillside village.
Isn’t this the ending of the film?
No! I’m sorry but
There is a single blossom
On the geranium, and when it falls, Captain de Boeldieu
Dies, discovering his afterlife along a November road—
He does not know that two men are hiding in the marsh
Beside him; nevertheless, it is at this moment that the film
Suffers its true conclusion. The two men hiding
In the marsh will escape across the border, only
To be returned to the continuing war. This is why there
Is no importance to your version of the story. And there
Will be another war. And more horror for the geranium!
So, to pass the time, the imprisoned soldiers receive
A steamer trunk filled with women’s clothing,
They will all perform in a revue: a chorus
Of boys and men, rouge and talcum, black stockings,
Garters, the tonneau dresses, false breasts and
Large paper carnations riding up like epaulets 
On their broad shoulders. These poignant inversions
Are not ridiculous: the third boy from the right
Has delicate milky thighs, these women are not ridiculous
Until they begin to stiffen into men as they sing,
In this comedy, their national anthem! The Russian
Prisoners have been given a trunk, also, from their
Mysterious Czarina; the men open it expecting vodka
And sausages. The box is filled with straw
And books on cooking, painting, and algebra. In disgust
They burn these books—kiss good-bye the frontier 
Of algebra and the desire for wedding tripe!
Now, these officers who are escape artists are moved
As an elite corps and north to Wintersborn. Later,
They are taken to a damp limestone castle   
From which no one will escape. The Commandant
Is the stoic aristocrat, Rauffenstein, his head is in
A brace like a white egg in a silver teaspoon.
I mean no disrespect, but the balding Rauffenstein is
An abject picture of suffering. His villa has but one
Flower, a tall laden geranium. 
Rauffenstein and the other aristocrat, Boeldieu,
Are friends. Both would know that to clear a monocle
One uses spirits of vinegar. They stand confirmed
In manner beside a squirrel cage. Rauffenstein feels
Superior to the other two principals, the rich
Jew, Rosenthal, and the charming emotional Marechal.
These two hide in the marsh while Boeldieu dies
Of a bullet wound. Only a king may kill a king!
And Rauffenstein did it with his pistol; taking aim
But missing the leg; he severed in three places
Boeldieu’s intestine! 
The Captain is given a room in the turret that holds
The flowering geranium. Now comes the oratio obliqua
Of the marksman, Rauffenstein; the disfigured Commandant
Is sincerely saddened
At having killed the noble Captain. But before
The shooting and escape we sensed the Captain’s
Sacrifice was not sacrifice, or suicide, but
The grand escape—a country road into another landscape. . .
There are bells tolling down in the village.
Rosenthal and Marechal with ropes have dropped 
Past the castle’s battlements to the ground.
They run away across snowy farmland. Marechal’s teeth
Are stained from chewing licorice-flavored tobacco.
Rosenthal and Marechal are extremes who have
Strong feelings for each other. They are befriended
By a German widow, Ulsa, and her daughter, Lotte;
Ulsa sleeps with the tall handsome Jew. He promises
To return for her when the war is over. He
Will lose both his legs at Mégéglise.
This is not known within the story, but he’ll bleed 
To death beside a little bridge. He lived his illusion
In the Orient of Delacroix, his servants were Syrians
And Negroes. He loved the little ivory spoons that
Chinese women in the open markets use to bathe
And freshen the exotic tiny fish they sell out
Of huge clay bowls. . .
In the boathouse the children sleep, while Jean’s
Oldest cousin, drunken, falls out of a rowboat.
The lone swimmer has joined Renior on the raft.
The film now reveals the first diversion
As all of the prisoners of the fortress begin playing
Several hundred wooden flutes, the noise is like women
Crying over the fresh mounds at Verdun. This diversion
Is not illusion
And as the Boches collect the flutes, the drunken cousin
Tries to join Renior on the raft. Boeldieu flees
To the heights of the castle, the second diversion!
We hear: Halt! Halt! Halt!
A gunshot, and chowder with blood falls from Boeldieu’s
Opened stomach all the way down to the courtyard. 
There are small fish bones in the viscera on the cobbled
Courtyard floor. Scissors cut the blue blossom
From the geranium. Boeldieu will die. . . dead,   
He awakens on a country road where, now a peasant,
He walks a white horse under the looming, bare trees.
Rosenthal and Marechal are watching
As they hide in the dead marsh flowers of
An early November. They are alive. They do not
Recognize their friend. Renoir’s cousin, asking for
More wine, climbing onto the raft, spills 
Everything, and the projector with its crude lamp
Sinks slowly to the bottom of the lake—
Its dusky lighted windows like a bathysphere
Lost off a cable that frayed, whoever is alive
Inside the iron bell is experiencing
An eternal falling through water without the promise
Of a bottom. . . it’s 1937, the children
Asleep in the boathouse are being aroused, they wake
To a bat caught in the wall of linen, they think it’s
Their uncle still casting images of animals for them. . .

To My Noble Friend, Mr. Charles Cotton



O thou that swing’st upon the waving hair    Of some well-fillèd oaten beard, Drunk every night with a delicious tear    Dropped thee from heaven, where now th’ art reared;  The joys of earth and air are thine entire,    That with thy feet and wings dost hop and fly; And, when thy poppy works, thou dost retire    To thy carved acorn-bed to lie.  Up with the day, the sun thou welcom’st then,    Sport’st in the gilt-plats of his beams, And all these merry days mak’st merry men,    Thyself, and melancholy streams.  But ah, the sickle! Golden ears are cropped;    Ceres and Bacchus bid good night; Sharp, frosty fingers all your flowers have topped,    And what scythes spared, winds shave off quite.  Poor verdant fool, and now green ice! thy joys,    Large and as lasting as thy perch of grass, Bid us lay in ’gainst winter rain, and poise    Their floods with an o’erflowing glass.  Thou best of men and friends! we will create    A genuine summer in each other’s breast, And spite of this cold time and frozen fate,    Thaw us a warm seat to our rest.  Our sacred hearths shall burn eternally,    As vestal flames; the North Wind, he Shall strike his frost-stretched wings, dissolve, and fly    This Etna in epitome.  Dropping December shall come weeping in,    Bewail th’usurping of his reign: But when in showers of old Greek we begin,    Shall cry he hath his crown again!  Night, as clear Hesper, shall our tapers whip    From the light casements where we play, And the dark hag from her black mantle strip,    And stick there everlasting day.  Thus richer than untempted kings are we,    That, asking nothing, nothing need: Though lords of all what seas embrace, yet he    That wants himself is poor indeed.

Be like a bear in the forest of yourself.
Even sleeping you are powerful in your breath.
Every hair has life
and standing, as you do, swaying
from one foot to the other
all the forest stands with you.
Each minute sound, one after another,
is distinct in your ear. Here
in the blur of mixed sensations, you can
feel the crisp outline of being, particulate.
Great as you are, huge as you are and
growling like the deepest drum,
the continual vibration that makes music
what it is,
not some light stone skipped on the surface of things,
you travel below
sounding the depths where only the dauntless go.
Be like the bear and
do not forget
how you rounded your
massive shape over the just ripened
berry which burst
in your mouth that moment
how you rolled in
the wet grass, cool and silvery, mingling
with your sensate skin,
how you shut
your eyes and swam far and farther
still, starlight
shaping itself to your body,
starship rocking the grand, slow waves
under the white trees, in the
snowy night.

And they killed the Moors
“to civilize a nation”
And they just killed the earth
And blew out the sun
In the name of a god
Whose genesis was white
And war wooed god
And america was born
Where war became peace
And genocide patriotism
And honor is a happy slave
cause all god’s chillun need rhythm
And glory hallelujah why can’t peace

   ain’t they got no shame
And making the world safe for democracy
Were twenty millon slaves
   nah, they ain’t got no shame 
And they barbecued six million
To raise the price of beef
And crossed the 38th parallel
To control the price of rice
   ain’t we never gonna see the light 
And champagne was shipped out of the East   
While kosher pork was introduced
To Africa
   Only the torch can show the way 
In the beginning was the deed   
And the deed was death 
And the honkies are getting confused   
   peace be still 
So the great white prince
Was shot like a nigger in texas
And our Black shining prince was murdered   
like that thug in his cathedral
While our nigger in memphis
was shot like their prince in dallas
And my lord

The rumblings of this peace must be stilled

Greenland’s icy mountains are fascinating and grand,And wondrously created by the Almighty’s command;And the works of the Almighty there’s few can understand:Who knows but it might be a part of Fairyland?
Because there are churches of ice, and houses glittering like glass,And for scenic grandeur there’s nothing can it surpass,Besides there’s monuments and spires, also ruins,Which serve for a safe retreat from the wild bruins.
And there’s icy crags and precipices, also beautiful waterfalls,And as the stranger gazes thereon, his heart it appalsWith a mixture of wonder, fear, and delight,Till at last he exclaims, Oh! what a wonderful sight!
The icy mountains they’re higher than a brig’s topmast,And the stranger in amazement stands aghastAs he beholds the water flowing off the melted iceAdown the mountain sides, that he cries out, Oh! how nice!
Such sights as these are truly magnificent to be seen,Only that the mountain tops are white instead of green,And rents and caverns in them, the same as on a rugged mountain side,And suitable places, in my opinion, for mermaids to reside.
Sometimes these icy mountains suddenly topple o’erWith a wild and rumbling hollow-starting roar;And new peaks and cliffs rise up out of the sea,While great cataracts of uplifted brine pour down furiously.
And those that can witness such an awful sightCan only gaze thereon in solemn silence and delight,And the most Godfearless man that hath this region trodWould be forced to recognise the power and majesty of God.
Oh! how awful and grand it must be on a sunshiny dayTo see one of these icy mountains in pieces give way!While, crack after crack, it falls with a mighty crashFlat upon the sea with a fearful splash.
And in the breaking up of these mountains they roar like thunder,Which causes the stranger no doubt to wonder;Also the Esquimaux of Greenland betimes will standAnd gaze on the wondrous work of the Almighty so grand.
When these icy mountains are falling, the report is like big guns,And the glittering brilliancy of them causes mock-suns,And around them there’s connected a beautiful ring of light,And as the stranger looks thereon, it fills his heart with delight.
Oh! think on the danger of seafaring menIf any of these mighty mountains where falling on them;Alas! they would be killed ere the hand of man could them saveAnd, poor creatures, very likely find a watery grave!
’Tis most beautiful to see and hear the whales whistling and blowing,And the sailors in their small boats quickly after them rowing,While the whales keep lashing the water all their mightWith their mighty tails, left and right.
In winter there’s no sunlight there night or day,Which, no doubt, will cause the time to pass tediously away,And cause the Esquimaux to long for the light of day,So as they will get basking themselves in the sun’s bright array.
In summer there is perpetual sunlight,Which fill the Esquimaux’s hearts with delight;And is seen every day and night in the blue sky,Which makes the scenery appear most beautiful to the eye.
During summer and winter there the land is covered with snow,Which sometimes must fill the Esquimaux’ hearts with woeAs they traverse fields of ice, ten or fifteen feet thick,And with cold, no doubt, their hearts will be touched to the quick.
And let those that read or hear this feel thankful to GodThat the icy fields of Greenland they have never trod;Especially while seated around the fireside on a cold winter night,Let them think of the cold and hardships Greenland sailors have to fight.

All this was written on the next day’s list.
On which the busyness unfurled its cursive roots,   
pale but effective,
and the long stern of the necessary, the sum of events, 
built-up its tiniest cathedral ...
(Or is it the sum of what takes place?)
If I lean down, to whisper, to them,
down into their gravitational field, there where they head busily on
into the woods, laying the gifts out one by one, onto the path,   
hoping to be on the air,
hoping to please the children—
(and some gifts overwrapped and some not wrapped at all)—if   
I stir the wintered ground-leaves
up from the paths, nimbly, into a sheet of sun,
into an escape-route-width of sun, mildly gelatinous where wet, though   
                                                                               mostly crisp,   
fluffing them up a bit, and up, as if to choke the singularity of sun
with this jubilation of manyness, all through and round these passers-by—
just leaves, nothing that can vaporize into a thought,   
no, a burning-bush’s worth of spidery, up-ratcheting, tender-cling leaves,   
oh if—the list gripped hard by the left hand of one,   
the busyness buried so deep into the puffed-up greenish mind of one,
the hurried mind hovering over its rankings,
the heart—there at the core of the drafting leaves—wet and warm at the   
                                                                                        zero of
the bright mock-stairwaying-up of the posthumous leaves—the heart,   
formulating its alleyways of discovery,
fussing about the integrity of the whole,
the heart trying to make time and place seem small,
sliding its slim tears into the deep wallet of each new event
                                                                   on the list
then checking it off—oh the satisfaction—each check a small kiss,
an echo of the previous one, off off it goes the dry high-ceilinged   
                                                                                  obligation,   
checked-off by the fingertips, by the small gust called done that swipes
the unfinishable’s gold hem aside, revealing
what might have been, peeling away what should ...   
There are flowerpots at their feet.
There is fortune-telling in the air they breathe.
It filters in with its flashlight-beam, its holy-water-tinted air,
down into the open eyes, the lampblack open mouth.   
Oh listen to these words I’m spitting out for you.   
My distance from you makes them louder.   
Are we all waiting for the phone to ring?   
Who should it be? What fountain is expected to
thrash forth mysteries of morning joy? What quail-like giant tail of   
promises, pleiades, psalters, plane-trees,   
what parapets petalling-forth the invisible   
into the world of things,
turning the list into its spatial form at last,
into its archival many-headed, many-legged colony....   
Oh look at you.
What is it you hold back? What piece of time is it the list   
won’t cover?   You down there, in the theater of   
operations—you, throat of the world—so diacritical—
(are we all waiting for the phone to ring?)—
(what will you say? are you home? are you expected soon?)—
oh wanderer back from break, all your attention focused
—as if the thinking were an oar, this ship the last of some   
original fleet, the captains gone but some of us   
who saw the plan drawn out
still here—who saw the thinking clot-up in the bodies of the greater men,
who saw them sit in silence while the voices in the other room
lit up with passion, itchings, dreams of landings,   
while the solitary ones,
heads in their hands, so still,
the idea barely forming
at the base of that stillness,
the idea like a homesickness starting just to fold and pleat and knot   
                                                                                           itself
out of the manyness—the plan—before it’s thought,   
before it’s a done deal or the name-you’re-known-by—
the men of x, the outcomes of y—before—
the mind still gripped hard by the hands
that would hold the skull even stiller if they could,
that nothing distract, that nothing but the possible be let   
                                                       to filter through—
the possible and then the finely filamented hope, the filigree,   
without the distractions of wonder—
oh tiny golden spore just filtering in to touch the good idea,   
which taking-form begins to twist,
coursing for bottom-footing, palpating for edge-hold, limit,   
now finally about to
rise, about to go into the other room—and yet
not having done so yet, not yet—the
intake—before the credo, before the plan—
right at the homesickness—before this list you hold   
in your exhausted hand. Oh put it down.

Men of the Twenty-first     Up by the Chalk Pit Wood, Weak with our wounds and our thirst,     Wanting our sleep and our food, After a day and a night.     God, shall we ever forget? Beaten and broke in the fight,     But sticking it, sticking it yet, Trying to hold the line,     Fainting and spent and done; Always the thud and the whine,     Always the yell of the Hun. Northumberland, Lancaster, York,     Durham and Somerset, Fighting alone, worn to the bone,     But sticking it, sticking it yet.  Never a message of hope,     Never a word of cheer! Fronting Hill 70’s shell-swept slope,     With the dull, dead plain in our rear; Always the shriek of the shell,     Always the roar of the burst, Always the tortures of Hell,     As waiting and wincing we cursed Our luck, the guns, and the Boche.     When our Corporal shouted “Stand to!” And I heard some one cry, “Clear the front for the Guards!”—     And the Guards came through.  Our throats they were parched and hot,     But Lord, if you’d heard the cheer, Irish and Welsh and Scot,     Coldstream and Grenadier— Two Brigades, if you please,     Dressing as straight as a hem. We, we were down on our knees,     Praying for us and for them, Praying with tear-wet cheek,       Praying with outstretched hand. Lord! I could speak for a week,     But how could you understand? How could your cheeks be wet?     Such feelin’s don’t come to you; But how can me or my mates forget     When the Guards came through?  “Five yards left extend!”     It passed from rank to rank, And line after line, with never a bend,     And a touch of the London swank. A trifle of swank and dash,     Cool as a home parade, Twinkle, glitter and flash,     Flinching never a shade, With the shrapnel right in their face,     Doing their Hyde Park stunt, Swinging along at an easy pace,     Arms at the trail, eyes front. Man! it was great to see!     Man! it was fine to do! It’s a cot, and hospital ward for me, But I’ll tell them in Blighty wherever I be,     How the Guards came through.

You may talk o’ gin and beer   
When you’re quartered safe out ’ere,   
An’ you’re sent to penny-fights an’ Aldershot it;
But when it comes to slaughter   
You will do your work on water,
An’ you’ll lick the bloomin’ boots of ’im that’s got it.   
Now in Injia’s sunny clime,   
Where I used to spend my time   
A-servin’ of ’Er Majesty the Queen,   
Of all them blackfaced crew   
The finest man I knew
Was our regimental bhisti, Gunga Din,   
      He was ‘Din! Din! Din!
   ‘You limpin’ lump o’ brick-dust, Gunga Din!
      ‘Hi! Slippy hitherao
      ‘Water, get it! Panee lao,
   ‘You squidgy-nosed old idol, Gunga Din.’ 
The uniform ’e wore
Was nothin’ much before,
An’ rather less than ’arf o’ that be’ind,
For a piece o’ twisty rag   
An’ a goatskin water-bag
Was all the field-equipment ’e could find.
When the sweatin’ troop-train lay
In a sidin’ through the day,
Where the ’eat would make your bloomin’ eyebrows crawl,
We shouted ‘Harry By!’
Till our throats were bricky-dry,
Then we wopped ’im ’cause ’e couldn’t serve us all.
      It was ‘Din! Din! Din!
   ‘You ’eathen, where the mischief ’ave you been?   
      ‘You put some juldee in it
      ‘Or I’ll marrow you this minute
   ‘If you don’t fill up my helmet, Gunga Din!’ 
’E would dot an’ carry one
Till the longest day was done;
An’ ’e didn’t seem to know the use o’ fear.
If we charged or broke or cut,
You could bet your bloomin’ nut,
’E’d be waitin’ fifty paces right flank rear.   
With ’is mussick on ’is back,
’E would skip with our attack,
An’ watch us till the bugles made 'Retire,’   
An’ for all ’is dirty ’ide
’E was white, clear white, inside
When ’e went to tend the wounded under fire!   
      It was ‘Din! Din! Din!’
   With the bullets kickin’ dust-spots on the green.   
      When the cartridges ran out,
      You could hear the front-ranks shout,   
   ‘Hi! ammunition-mules an' Gunga Din!’ 
I shan’t forgit the night
When I dropped be’ind the fight
With a bullet where my belt-plate should ’a’ been.   
I was chokin’ mad with thirst,
An’ the man that spied me first
Was our good old grinnin’, gruntin’ Gunga Din.   
’E lifted up my ’ead,
An’ he plugged me where I bled,
An’ ’e guv me ’arf-a-pint o’ water green.
It was crawlin’ and it stunk,
But of all the drinks I’ve drunk,
I’m gratefullest to one from Gunga Din.
      It was 'Din! Din! Din!
   ‘’Ere’s a beggar with a bullet through ’is spleen;   
   ‘’E's chawin’ up the ground,
      ‘An’ ’e’s kickin’ all around:
   ‘For Gawd’s sake git the water, Gunga Din!’ 
’E carried me away
To where a dooli lay,
An’ a bullet come an’ drilled the beggar clean.   
’E put me safe inside,
An’ just before ’e died,
'I ’ope you liked your drink,’ sez Gunga Din.   
So I’ll meet ’im later on
At the place where ’e is gone—
Where it’s always double drill and no canteen.   
’E’ll be squattin’ on the coals
Givin’ drink to poor damned souls,
An’ I’ll get a swig in hell from Gunga Din!   
      Yes, Din! Din! Din!
   You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din!   
   Though I’ve belted you and flayed you,   
      By the livin’ Gawd that made you,
   You’re a better man than I am, Gunga Din!

We’re having a Halloween party at school.
I’m dressed up like Dracula. Man, I look cool!
I dyed my hair black, and I cut off my bangs.
I’m wearing a cape and some fake plastic fangs. 
I put on some makeup to paint my face white,
like creatures that only come out in the night.
My fingernails, too, are all pointed and red.
I look like I’m recently back from the dead. 
My mom drops me off, and I run into school
and suddenly feel like the world’s biggest fool.
The other kids stare like I’m some kind of freak—
the Halloween party is not till next week.

“In warm sunlight jade
engenders smoke”; poetry,
like indigo mountain,
keeps its distance; 
the light plays words
and figures, stone’s
edge edged with air,
green haze growing. 
Amused by butterflies,
Chuang Tsu dreaming,
the emperor’s heart in
spring, thoroughly transformed. 
Still, in pieces, the words
rest so much apart.
Risking my life I lean
on dangerous railings.  
When the dream wakes
to its own particulars,
the strands scattered,
loose hair on muslin, 
broken characters
the reeds make, unmake— vague    no reason
bright    again    dark—

^^EOP^^

MORNING 
Reading the bones, wetting a fingertip   
to trace archaic characters, I feel
a breeze of silence flow up past my wrist,   
icy. Can I speak here? The bones say I must.
As the first light strikes across the lake, magpies   
scream, and the cast bones say the work must come true,   
it’s been true all along, we are what we do   
out on our digs. Dictor and looker, all eyes,   
with spade and a jeweler’s loupe I sift mud & dust   
for bone, for shellcast. Spy, archeologist   
of freshness, I expect sight-made-sound to reveal   
fear cold at the throat of change, and loosen its grip   
so that mind, riding the bloodwarm stream, wells up   
as the speech that bears it and is telling.   EVENING 
Magpies scream. Though the tongues of birds   
say Now and warn forward, free of a live past,
we seek back and forth for change, the ghostly sparkling
of our watertable under everywhere.
If I don’t speak to tap & ease it out,
I go dry & dumb & will die wicked.
On the lake of the poets a stone lamp flickers.   
It casts eight moons dancing, casting doubt   
on the moon that rides above the winter air.
Ice thaws in a poet’s throat; the springing
truth is fresh. It wakes taste. The taste lasts.
Language floods the mud; mind makes a cast of words;   
it precipitates, mercurial, like T’ang discourse
riding the tidal constant of its source.

There’s just no accounting for happiness,
or the way it turns up like a prodigal
who comes back to the dust at your feet
having squandered a fortune far away. 
And how can you not forgive?
You make a feast in honor of what
was lost, and take from its place the finest
garment, which you saved for an occasion
you could not imagine, and you weep night and day
to know that you were not abandoned,
that happiness saved its most extreme form
for you alone. 
No, happiness is the uncle you never
knew about, who flies a single-engine plane
onto the grassy landing strip, hitchhikes
into town, and inquires at every door
until he finds you asleep midafternoon
as you so often are during the unmerciful
hours of your despair. 
It comes to the monk in his cell.
It comes to the woman sweeping the street
with a birch broom, to the child
whose mother has passed out from drink.
It comes to the lover, to the dog chewing
a sock, to the pusher, to the basketmaker,
and to the clerk stacking cans of carrots
in the night.
                     It even comes to the boulder
in the perpetual shade of pine barrens,
to rain falling on the open sea,
to the wineglass, weary of holding wine.

For Barbara Green



Happiness. I am not used
to this. (There is always
something wrong.)
Look at it
the bright early tree.
(I am trying to find out
how you fell.)
The leaves have already turned.
(I want you to see
this, how they
glow outside the glass.)
Morning light strikes
differently. For so
many years I hardly
had time to know such
moments. They struck me
with such intensity
I would have said
battered me open.
I never understood
they were mine.
I was panicked. Unhappiness caught up with me
all the time.
Did you know
the speed of light never alters
even when you go faster
it will be
still that much faster
than you?
(I am thinking that in your fall
something momentous occurred.)
What I see as beautiful
I want you to see too.
Next door, the workmen are hammering.
Very soon we’ll go to lunch.
For some reason this moves me to tears.
How life is.
(One does not have to explain
what occurs. One only need say
it has meaning.)
Years ago, when I was young
I traveled to Italy, took in
the great sights. I was in awe, yet
I did not understand
seeing Masaccio’s frescoes
fading like shadows into the walls,
this would be the only time
nor that
I would never forget.
Those muted shades are
still with me, as possession
and longing, and the view too
of the square before that church
the air, newly spring,
that day, all of it.
Life, I have finally begun to realize,
is real.
(All this time you recover
from falling
will sink indelibly into mind.)
The leaves
may fall before you are able
to see them. Science
has recently learned
the line
of existence is soft
and stretches out like a field
wind and light shaping the grass
energy
of sight giving consciousness
force. In the meantime
we live out our lives.
(This morning we talked for so long
everything became lucid.
How can I say what I see?)
At each turning
perfection eludes me.
One moment is not like another.
Last spring
the house next door caught fire.
There was the smell of gas.
We thought
both houses would go.
I vanished up the hill,
went to the house of a friend
where we listened for flames
and to that aria from Italian
opera, was it the one of love,
or jealousy, or grief?
My house was untouched.
Now the one next door is painted,
fixed. In place of
perfection, the empty hands
I turned out to the world
are filled.
With what? A letter
half written, the notes
I make on this page,
this new feeling about my shoulders
of age, that sad child’s story
you told me this morning,
the workmen’s tools sounding
and stopping. What? As time
moves through me, does it also
move through you?
I keep remembering what you said,
ways you have of seeing (and that
light must have curved with
you fall.) This
is the paradox of vision:
Sharp perception softens
our existence in the world. 
                  1986

Happy as something unimportant
and free as a thing unimportant.
As something no one prizes
and which does not prize itself.
As something mocked by all
and which mocks at their mockery.
As laughter without serious reason.
As a yell able to outyell itself.
Happy as no matter what,
as any no matter what. 
Happy
as a dog’s tail.

Babies do not want to hear about babies; they like to be told of giants and castles.
Dr. Johnson

No one keeps a secret so well as a child 
Victor Hugo



My mother stands at the screen door, laughing.   
“Out out damn Spot,” she commands our silly dog.   
I wonder what this means. I rise into adult air 
like a hollyhock, I’m so proud to be loved   
like this. The air is tight to my nervous body.
I use new clothes and shoes the way the corn-studded    
soil around here uses nitrogen, giddily.
Ohio, Ohio, Ohio. Often I sing
to myself all day like a fieldful of August    
insects, just things I whisper, really,
a trance in sneakers. I’m learning
to read from my mother and soon I’ll go to school, 
I hate it when anyone dies or leaves and the air                  
goes slack around my body and I have to hug myself,
a cloud, an imaginary friend, the stream in the road- 
side park. I love to be called for dinner.   
Spot goes out and I go in and the lights
in the kitchen go on and the dark, 
which also has a body like a cloud’s,
leans lightly against the house. Tomorrow
I’ll find the sweatstains it left, little grey smudges. 
.       .       . 
       Here’s a sky no higher than a streetlamp,
and a stack of morning papers cinched by wire.   
It’s 4:00 A.M. A stout dog, vaguely beagle,    
minces over the dry, fresh-fallen snow;
and here’s our sleep-sodden paperboy   
with his pliers, his bike, his matronly dog,    
his unclouding face set for paper route
like an alarm clock. Here’s a memory
in the making, for this could be the morning    
he doesn’t come home and his parents   
two hours later drive his route until
they find him asleep, propped against a streetlamp, 
his papers all delivered and his dirty paper-
satchel slack, like an emptied lung,
and he blur-faced and iconic in the morning 
air rinsing itself a paler and paler blue
through which a last few dandruff-flecks   
of snow meander casually down.    
The dog squeaks in out of the dark,
snuffling me too me too. And here he goes   
home to memory, and to hot chocolate 
on which no crinkled skin forms like infant ice,
and to the long and ordinary day,
school, two triumphs and one severe 
humiliation on the playground, the past
already growing its scabs, the busride home,
dinner, and evening leading to sleep 
like the slide that will spill him out, come June,   
into the eye-reddening chlorine waters   
of the municipal pool. Here he goes to bed. 
Kiss. Kiss. Teeth. Prayers. Dark. Dark.   
Here the dog lies down by his bed,   
and sighs and farts. Will he always be 
this skinny, chicken-bones?   
He’ll remember like a prayer
how his mother made breakfast for him 
every morning before he trudged out   
to snip the papers free. Just as   
his mother will remember she felt 
guilty never to wake up with him   
to give him breakfast. It was Cream
of Wheat they always or never had together.  
It turns out you are the story of your childhood   
and you’re under constant revision,   
like a lonely folktale whose invisible folks 
are all the selves you’ve been, lifelong,   
shadows in fog, grey glimmers at dusk.   
And each of these selves had a childhood 
it traded for love and grudged to give away,   
now lost irretrievably, in storage   
like a set of dishes from which no food, 
no Cream of Wheat, no rabbit in mustard   
sauce, nor even a single raspberry,   
can be eaten until the afterlife, 
which is only childhood in its last   
disguise, all radiance or all humiliation,   
and so it is forfeit a final time. 
In fact it was awful, you think, or why   
should the piecework of grief be endless?   
Only because death is, and likewise loss, 
which is not awful, but only breathtaking.   
There’s no truth about your childhood,   
though there’s a story, yours to tend, 
like a fire or garden. Make it a good one,   
since you’ll have to live it out, and all
its revisions, so long as you all shall live, 
for they shall be gathered to your deathbed,   
and they’ll have known to what you and they
would come, and this one time they’ll weep for you.  
The map in the shopping center has an X
signed “you are here.” A dream is like that.   
In a dream you are never eighty, though    
you may risk death by other means:
you’re on a ledge and memory calls you   
to jump, but a deft cop talks you in 
to a small, bright room, and snickers.
And in a dream, you’re everyone somewhat,   
but not wholly. I think I know how that 
works: for twenty-one years I had a father   
and then I became a father, replacing him   
but not really. Soon my sons will be fathers. 
Surely, that’s what middle-aged means,   
being father and son to sons and father.   
That a male has only one mother is another 
story, told wherever men weep wholly.   
Though nobody’s replaced. In one dream   
I’m leading a rope of children to safety, 
through a snowy farm. The farmer comes out   
and I have to throw snowballs well to him   
so we may pass. Even dreaming, I know 
he’s my father, at ease in his catcher’s   
squat, and that the dream has revived   
to us both an old unspoken fantasy: 
we’re a battery. I’m young, I’m brash,   
I don’t know how to pitch but I can   
throw a lamb chop past a wolf. And he 
can handle pitchers and control a game.   
I look to him for a sign. I’d nod
for anything. The damn thing is hard to grip 
without seams, and I don’t rely only
on my live, young arm, but throw by all   
the body I can get behind it, and it fluffs 
toward him no faster than the snow   
in the dream drifts down. Nothing
takes forever, but I know what the phrase 
means. The children grow more cold   
and hungry and cruel to each other
the longer the ball’s in the air, and it begins 
to melt. By the time it gets to him we’ll be   
our waking ages, and each of us is himself   
alone, and we all join hands and go. 
.       .       . 
       Toward dawn, rain explodes on the tin roof   
like popcorn. The pale light is streaked by grey
and that green you see just under the surface 
of water, a shimmer more than a color.   
Time to dive back into sleep, as if into   
happiness, that neglected discipline .... 
In those sixth-grade book reports
you had to say if the book was optimistic   
or not, and everyone looked at you 
the same way: how would he turn out?   
He rolls in his sleep like an otter.   
Uncle Ed has a neck so fat it’s funny, 
and on the way to work he pries the cap
off a Pepsi. Damn rain didn’t cool one weary   
thing for long; it’s gonna be a cooker. 
The boy sleeps with a thin chain of sweat   
on his upper lip, as if waking itself,   
becoming explicit, were hard work. 
Who knows if he’s happy or not?   
A child is all the tools a child has,   
growing up, who makes what he can.

Ain’t no use as I can see In sittin’ underneath a tree An’ growlin’ that your luck is bad, An’ that your life is extry sad; Your life ain’t sadder than your neighbor’s Nor any harder are your labors; It rains on him the same as you, An’ he has work he hates to do; An’ he gits tired an’ he gits cross, An’ he has trouble with the boss; You take his whole life, through an’ through, Why, he’s no better off than you.  If whinin’ brushed the clouds away I wouldn’t have a word to say; If it made good friends out o’ foes I’d whine a bit, too, I suppose; But when I look around an’ see A lot o’ men resemblin’ me, An’ see ’em sad, an’ see ’em gay With work t’ do most every day, Some full o’ fun, some bent with care, Some havin’ troubles hard to bear, I reckon, as I count my woes, They’re ’bout what everybody knows.  The day I find a man who’ll say He’s never known a rainy day, Who’ll raise his right hand up an’ swear In forty years he’s had no care, Has never had a single blow, An’ never known one touch o’ woe, Has never seen a loved one die, Has never wept or heaved a sigh, Has never had a plan go wrong, But allas laughed his way along; Then I’ll sit down an’ start to whine That all the hard luck here is mine.

His yellow eyes, and one long scar that cut
Across his temple and plowed through a thick
Canopy of kinky hair. 
The WORD / was / that Hard Rock wasn’t a mean nigger
Anymore, that the doctors had bored a hole in his head,
Cut out part of his brain, and shot electricity
Through the rest. When they brought Hard Rock back,
Handcuffed and chained, he was turned loose,
Like a freshly gelded stallion, to try his new status.
And we all waited and watched, like a herd of sheep,
To see if the WORD was true. 
As we waited we wrapped ourselves in the cloak
Of his exploits: “Man, the last time, it took eight
Screws to put him in the Hole.” “Yeah, remember when he
Smacked the captain with his dinner tray?” “He set
The record for time in the Hole—67 straight days!”
“Ol Hard Rock! man, that’s one crazy nigger.”
And then the jewel of a myth that Hard Rock had once bit
A screw on the thumb and poisoned him with syphilitic spit. 
The testing came, to see if Hard Rock was really tame.
A hillbilly called him a black son of a bitch
And didn’t lose his teeth, a screw who knew Hard Rock
From before shook him down and barked in his face.
And Hard Rock did nothing. Just grinned and looked silly,
His eyes empty like knot holes in a fence. 
And even after we discovered that it took Hard Rock
Exactly 3 minutes to tell you his first name,
We told ourselves that he had just wised up,
Was being cool; but we could not fool ourselves for long,
And we turned away, our eyes on the ground. Crushed.
He had been our Destroyer, the doer of things
We dreamed of doing but could not bring ourselves to do,
The fears of years, like a biting whip,
Had cut deep bloody grooves
Across our backs.

He does not think that I haunt here nightly:
  How shall I let him knowThat whither his fancy sets him wandering
  I, too, alertly go? -Hover and hover a few feet from him
  Just as I used to do,But cannot answer the words he lifts me –
  Only listen thereto!
When I could answer he did not say them:
  When I could let him knowHow I would like to join in his journeys
  Seldom he wished to go.Now that he goes and wants me with him
  More than he used to do,Never he sees my faithful phantom
  Though he speaks thereto.
Yes, I companion him to places
  Only dreamers know,Where the shy hares print long paces,
  Where the night rooks go;Into old aisles where the past is all to him,
  Close as his shade can do,Always lacking the power to call to him,
  Near as I reach thereto!
What a good haunter I am, O tell him,
  Quickly make him knowIf he but sigh since my loss befell him
  Straight to his side I go.Tell him a faithful one is doing
  All that love can doStill that his path may be worth pursuing,
  And to bring peace thereto.

Off Havana, the ocean is green this morning
of my birth. The conchers clean their knives on leather
straps and watch the sky while three couples
who have been dancing on the deck of a ship
in the harbor, the old harbor of the fifties, kiss
each other's cheeks and call it a night. 
On a green sofa five dresses wait
to be fitted. The seamstress kneeling at Mother's feet
has no idea I am about to be born. Mother
pats her stomach which is flat
as the lace mats on the dressmaker's table. She thinks
I'm playing in my room. But as usual, she's wrong. 
I'm about to be born in a park in Havana. Oh,
this is important, everything in the dressmaker's house
is furred like a cat. And Havana leans right up
against the windows. In the park, the air
is chocolate, the sweet breath of a man
smoking an expensive cigar. The grass 
is drinkable, dazzling, white. In a moment
I'll get up from a bench, lured
by a flock of pigeons, lazily sipping
the same syrupy music through a straw.
Mother is so ignorant, she thinks
I'm rolled like a ball of yarn under the bed. What 
does she know of how I got trapped in my life?
She thinks it's all behind her, the bloody
sheets, the mirror in the ceiling
where I opened such a sudden furious blue, her eyes
bruised shut like mine. The pigeon's eyes
are orange, unblinking, a doll's. Mother always said 
I wanted to touch everything because
I was a child. But I was younger than that.
I was so young I thought whatever I
wanted, the world wanted too. Workers
in the fields wanted the glint of sun on their machetes.
Sugarcane came naturally sweet, you 
had only to lick the earth where it grew.
The music I heard each night outside
my window lived in the mouth of a bird. I was so young
I thought it was easy as walking
into the ocean which always had room
for my body. So when I held out my hands 
I expected the pigeon to float between them
like a blossom, dusting my fingers with the manna
of its wings. But the world is wily, and doesn't want
to be held for long, which is why
as my hands reached out, workers lay down
their machetes and left the fields, which is why 
a prostitute in a little calle of Havana dreamed
the world was a peach and flicked
open a knife. And Mother, startled, shook
out a dress with big peonies splashed like dirt
across the front, as if she had fallen
chasing after me in the rain. But what could I do? 
I was about to be born, I was about to have
my hair combed into the new music
everyone was singing. The dressmaker sang it, her mouth
filled with pins. The butcher sang it and wiped
blood on his apron. Mother sang it and thought her body
was leaving her body. And when I tried 
I was so young the music beat right
through me, which is how the pigeon got away.
The song the world sings day after day
isn't made of feathers, and the song a bird pours
itself into is tough as a branch
growing with the singer and the singer's delight.

The legendary muscle that wants and grieves,   
The organ of attachment, the pump of thrills   
And troubles, clinging in stubborn colonies 
Like pulpy shore-life battened on a jetty.
Slashed by the little deaths of sleep and pleasure,   
They swell in the nurturing spasms of the waves, 
Sucking to cling; and even in death itself—
Baked, frozen—they shrink to grip the granite harder.   
“Rid yourself of attachments and aversions”— 
But in her father’s orchard, already, he says
He’d like to be her bird, and she says: Sweet, yes,   
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing, 
Showing that she knows already—as Art Pepper,   
That first time he takes heroin, already knows   
That he will go to prison, and that he’ll suffer 
And knows he needs to have it, or die; and the one   
Who makes the General lose the world for love   
Lets him say, Would I had never seen her, but Oh! 
Says Enobarbus, Then you would have missed   
A wonderful piece of work, which left unseen   
Would bring less glory to your travels. Among 
The creatures in the rock-torn surf, a wave   
Of agitation, a gasp. A scholar quips,    Shakespeare was almost certainly homosexual, 
Bisexual, or heterosexual, the sonnets
Provide no evidence on the matter.

The heat of autumn
is different from the heat of summer.   
One ripens apples, the other turns them to cider.   
One is a dock you walk out on,   
the other the spine of a thin swimming horse
and the river each day a full measure colder.   
A man with cancer leaves his wife for his lover.
Before he goes she straightens his belts in the closet,   
rearranges the socks and sweaters inside the dresser
by color. That’s autumn heat:
her hand placing silver buckles with silver,   
gold buckles with gold, setting each   
on the hook it belongs on in a closet soon to be empty,   
and calling it pleasure.

Here they are. The soft eyes open.   
If they have lived in a wood
It is a wood.
If they have lived on plains
It is grass rolling
Under their feet forever. 
Having no souls, they have come,   
Anyway, beyond their knowing.   
Their instincts wholly bloom   
And they rise.
The soft eyes open. 
To match them, the landscape flowers,   
Outdoing, desperately
Outdoing what is required:
The richest wood,
The deepest field. 
For some of these,
It could not be the place
It is, without blood.
These hunt, as they have done,
But with claws and teeth grown perfect, 
More deadly than they can believe.   
They stalk more silently,
And crouch on the limbs of trees,   
And their descent
Upon the bright backs of their prey 
May take years
In a sovereign floating of joy.   
And those that are hunted   
Know this as their life,
Their reward: to walk 
Under such trees in full knowledge   
Of what is in glory above them,   
And to feel no fear,
But acceptance, compliance.   
Fulfilling themselves without pain 
At the cycle’s center,
They tremble, they walk   
Under the tree,
They fall, they are torn,   
They rise, they walk again.

What’s geography? What difference what mountain
it is? In the intimacy of this altitude
its discolored snowfields overhang half the world. 
On a knife rim edge-up into whirlpools of sky,
feet are no anchor. Gravity sucks at the mind
spinning the blood-weighted body head downward. 
The mountain that had become a known profile
on the day’s horizon is a gesture of earth
swinging us above falling spaces, above
a map of the world. Disturber of the unseen,
provoker of the gusts in which we bend
struggling against destruction gaping eastward.
The wind fails. The breath held. The illusion of death.
The resisting shoulder unopposed lurches
west in innocent still air, as steep, as deep.

All Greece hates   
the still eyes in the white face,   
the lustre as of olives   
where she stands,   
and the white hands.    
All Greece reviles   
the wan face when she smiles,   
hating it deeper still   
when it grows wan and white,   
remembering past enchantments   
and past ills.    
Greece sees unmoved,   
God’s daughter, born of love,   
the beauty of cool feet   
and slenderest knees,   
could love indeed the maid,   
only if she were laid,   
white ash amid funereal cypresses.

Azure, ’tis I, come from Elysian shores
To hear the waves break on sonorous steps,
And see again the sunrise full of ships
Rising from darkness upon golden oars. 
My solitary arms call on the kings
Whose salty beards amused my silver hands.
I wept; they sang of triumphs in far lands,
And gulfs fled backward upon watery wings. 
I hear the trumpet and the martial horn
That wield the rhythm of the beating blade,
The song of rowers binding the tumult. 
And the gods! exalting on the prow with scorn
Their ancient smile that the slow waves insult,
Hold out their sculptured arms to my sad shade. 
                               From the French of Paul Valéry

Some nights
the rat with pointed teeth
makes his long way back
to the bowl of peaches.
He stands on the dining room table
sinking his tooth
drinking the pulp
of each fruity turned-up face
knowing you will read
this message and scream.
It is his only text,
to take and take in darkness,
to be gone before you awaken
and your giant feet
start creaking the floor. 
Where is the mother of the rat?
The father, the shredded nest,
which breath were we taking
when the rat was born,
when he lifted his shivering snout
to rafter and rivet and stone?
I gave him the names of the devil,
seared and screeching names,
I would not enter those rooms
without a stick to guide me,
I leaned on the light, shuddering,
and the moist earth under the house,
the trailing tails of clouds,
said he was in the closet,
the drawer of candles,
his nose was a wick. 
How would we live together
with our sad shoes and hideouts,
our lock on the door
and his delicate fingered paws
that could clutch and grip,
his blank slate of fur
and the pillow where we press our faces?
The bed that was a boat is sinking.
And the shores of morning loom up
lined with little shadows,
things we never wanted to be, or meet,
and all the rats are waving hello.

the Chinaman said don’t take the hardware
and gave me a steak I couldn’t cut (except the fat)
and there was an ant circling the coffee cup;
I left a dime tip and broke out a stick of cancer,
and outside I gave an old bum who looked about
the way I felt, I gave him a quarter,
and then I went up to see the old man
strong as steel girders, fit for bombers and blondes,
up the green rotten steps that housed rats
and past the secretaries showing leg and doing nothing
and the old man sat there looking at me
through two pairs of glasses and a vacation in Paris,
and he said, Kid, I hear you been takin’ Marylou out,
and I said, just to dinner, boss,
and he said, just to dinner, eh? you couldn’t hold
that broad’s pants on with all the rivets on 5th street,
and please remember you are a shipping clerk,
I am the boss here and I pay these broads and I pay you.
yes, sir, I said, and I felt he was going to skip it
but he slid my last check across the desk
and I took it and walked out
past
all the lovely legs, the skirts pulled up to the ass,
Marylou’s ass, Ann’s ass, Vicki’s ass, all of them,
and I went down to the bar
and George said whatya gonna do now,
and I said go to Russia or Hollywood Park,
and I looked up in time to see Marylou come in,
the long thin nose, the delicate face, the lips, the legs,
the breasts, the music, the talk the love the laughing
and she said
I quit when I found out
and the bastard got down on his knees and cried
and kissed the hem of my skirt and offered me money
and I
walked out
and he blubbered like a baby.
George, I said, another drink, and I put a quarter in
the juke
and the sun came out
and I looked outside in time to see the old bum
with my quarter
and a little more luck
that had turned into a happy wine-bottle,
and a bird even flew by cheep cheep,
right there on Eastside downtown, no kidding,
and the Chinaman came in for a quickie
claiming somebody had stolen a spoon and a coffee cup
and I leaned over and bit Marylou on the ear
and the whole joint rocked with music and freedom
and I decided that Russia was too far away
and Hollywood Park just close enough.

Go out into brightened   
space out there the fainter   
yellowish place it
makes for eye to enter out   
to greyed penumbra all the   
way to thoughtful searching   
sight of all beyond that
solid red both brick and seeming   
metal roof or higher black   
beyond the genial slope I   
look at daily house top on   
my own way up to heaven. 
         * 
Same roof, light’s gone   
down back of it, behind   
the crying end of day, “I   
need something to do,” it’s   
been again those other   
things, what’s out there,   
sodden edge of sea’s   
bay, city’s graveyard, park   
deserted, flattened aspect,   
leaves gone colored fall   
to sidewalk, street, the end   
of all these days but   
still this regal light. 
         * 
Trees stripped, rather shed
of leaves, the black solid trunks up
to fibrous mesh of smaller   
branches, it is weather’s window,   
weather’s particular echo, here   
as if this place had been once,   
now vacant, a door that had had   
hinges swung in air’s peculiar   
emptiness, greyed, slumped elsewhere,   
asphalt blank of sidewalks, line of   
linearly absolute black metal fence. 
         * 
Old sky freshened with cloud bulk   
slides over frame of window the   
shadings of softened greys a light   
of air up out of this dense high   
structured enclosure of buildings   
top or pushed up flat of bricked roof   
frame I love I love the safety of   
small world this door frame back   
of me the panes of simple glass yet   
airy up sweep of birch trees sit in   
flat below all designation declaration   
here as clouds move so simply away. 
         * 
Windows now lit close out the   
upper dark the night’s a face   
three eyes far fainter than   
the day all faced with light   
inside the room makes eye re-
flective see the common world   
as one again no outside coming   
in no more than walls and post-
card pictures place faces across   
that cautious dark the tree no   
longer seen more than black edge   
close branches somehow still between. 
         * 
He was at the edge of this
reflective echo the words blown   
back in air a bubble of suddenly   
apparent person who walked to
sit down by the familiar brook and   
thought about his fading life
all “fading life” in tremulous airy   
perspect saw it hover in the surface   
of that moving darkness at the edge   
of sun’s passing water’s sudden depth   
his own hands’ knotted surface the   
sounding in himself of some other. 
         * 
One forty five afternoon red   
car parked left hand side   
of street no distinguishing   
feature still wet day a bicycle   
across the way a green door-
way with arched upper window   
a backyard edge of back wall
to enclosed alley low down small   
windows and two other cars green   
and blue parked too and miles   
and more miles still to go. 
         * 
This early still sunless morning when a chair’s   
creak translates to cat’s cry a blackness still
out the window might be apparent night when the
house still sleeping behind me seems a bag of   
immense empty silence and I feel the children   
still breathing still shifting their dreams an   
enigma will soon arrive here and the loved one   
centers all in her heavy sleeping arm out the   
leg pushed down bedclothes this body unseen un-
known placed out there in night I can feel all   
about me still sitting in this small spare pool of   
light watching the letters the words try to speak. 
         * 
Classic emptiness it
sits out there edge of   
hierarchic roof top it
marks with acid fine edge   
of apparent difference it   
is there here here that
sky so up and out and where   
it wants to be no birds no   
other thing can for a   
moment distract it be

Because this evening Miss Hoang Yen
sat down with me in the small
tiled room of her family house
I am unable to sleep.
We shared a glass of cold and sweet water.   
On a blue plate her mother brought us
cake and smiled her betel-black teeth at me   
but I did not feel strange in the house
my country had tried to bomb into dust.   
In English thick and dazed as blood
she told me how she watched our planes   
cross her childhood’s sky,
all the children of Hanoi
carried in darkness to mountain hamlets, Nixon’s   
Christmas bombing. She let me hold her hand,   
her shy unmoving fingers, and told me
how afraid she was those days and how this fear   
had dug inside her like a worm and lives   
inside her still, won’t die or go away.
And because she’s stronger, she comforted me,   
said I’m not to blame,
the million sorrows alive in her gaze.
With the dead we share no common rooms.
With the frightened we can’t think straight;   
no words can bring the burning city back.   
Outside on Hung Dao Street
I tried to say good-bye and held her hand   
too long so she looked back through traffic   
towards her house and with her eyes   
she told me I should leave.
All night I ached for her and for myself   
and nothing I could think or pray
would make it stop. Some birds sang morning   
home across the lake. In small reed boats   
the lotus gatherers sailed out
among their resuming white blossoms. 
                                           Hanoi, 1990

Mistress Adrienne, I have been given a bed with a pink dresser In the hothouse Joining the Concord Public Library: the walls and roof are Glass and my privacy comes from the apple-geraniums, Violets, ferns, marigolds, and white mayflags. I get my meals With the janitor and his wife and all of the books are mine To use. I scour, sweep, and dust. I hope you don’t think of me As a runaway? I remember your kindness, Your lessons in reading and writing on the piazza. My journey was unusual. I saw some of the war And it was terrible even far up into the North. My first fright was at a train depot outside Memphis Where some soldiers found me eating not yet ripened   Quinces and grapes, they took me prisoner: first I helped some children carry tree limbs to the woodbox Of the locomotive, then, I was shown to a gentleman In the passenger car who was searching for his runaway Negress in a purple dress; he wouldn’t identify me,  And I was thrown in with about forty stray blacks into An open boxcar and soon we were moving, next to me A man was sucking on the small breasts of a girl Maybe twelve years of age, across from them A sad old woman smiled as she puffed on an old cigar end, By afternoon she was dead, her two friends Just kicked her out so that she rolled down into pasture Frightening some hogs that ran off into a thicket. The girl next to me whimpered and shook. Those quinces Just ran straight through me and all I could do was Squat in one corner that was supplied with ammonia-waters And hay. We were given that night Confederate uniforms To mend and when the others slept I dressed in three Shirts and trousers and leapt from the moving train, The padding helped some but I couldn’t walk the next day. I hid in a shack that seemed lonely but for a flock Of turkeys, some young hens, and a corncrib with tall Split palings. The next morning from a hill I watched field-workers on a tobacco plantation, it took Two men to carry a single leaf like a corpse from A battle scene. That night I found a horse with a bit In its mouth made of telegraph wire. He carried me up all The way to Youngstown. Chloe, you must Learn to swim in the pond and to ride the old sorrel.

The dog licks my hand as I worry   
about the left nipple   
of the woman in the bathroom. 
She is drying her hair, the woman
whose left nipple is sore.   
We looked this evening   
for diagonal cuts
or discoloration
or bite marks from small insects
that may be in our bed. 
It is a good bed, a faithful bed.   
A bed that won’t be hurt   
by the consideration we gave   
to the possibility of small   
though disproportionately
strong insects in our bed. 
The blow-dryer sounds like a jet   
taking off. The first time
I flew to Brussels, people began   
the journey happy but ended   
with drool on their shirts. 
She is drying her hair
though she has never been to Brussels.   
Drying her hair
though she could be petting a dog.   
Drying her hair
while having red thoughts
about what the pain in her nipple means. 
I would not dry my hair
in such a moment but I am bald.
The body of the woman   
has many ways to cease
being the body of the woman. 
I have one way   
to be happy
and she is that way. 
I would like to fly with her to Brussels.   
We would not be put off by the drool.   
This is what happens when people sleep.   
We would buy postcards of the little boy   
who saved Brussels when he peed on a fire.   
We would be romantic in public places. 
For the moment
these desires can best be furthered   
by petting a dog. 
I’m also working on this theory.   
That sometimes a part of the body
just hurts.
That the purpose of prayer
is to make the part of the body   
that sometimes just hurts   
the little toe or appendix. 
Something vestigial or redundant.   
Something that can be jettisoned.   
I have no reason
to use the word cancer
while petting a dog. 
Here is a piece of a second   
during which a jet is not flying   
nor is it on the ground. 
I’m working on a theory   
that no one can die
inside that piece of a second. 
If you are comforted
by this thought you are welcome   
to keep it.

With a boil the size of an egg
protruding from her right hip,
she knows what I must do,
and to stall me has locked herself
inside the bathroom, bargaining
for a way out. 
But it’s too late: I’ve seen
the oozing wounds stopped up with bits
of toilet paper and tape, the scarified
pockets that crater the surface
of her arms, buttocks, thighs. 
A mean fix torched her last vein
years ago, and she’s been banging the dope
ever since, puncturing her body
like a juju doll. She wants to kick,
but not now.  I’m not gonna lie to you, she says
in a velvet voice. I already know what she’s after:
something stronger than local, a few Percocet, a shot of Demerol
before she’ll let me begin. 
All I can tell you is, when the abscess finally drains
the odor is so foul it’s evil. 
And I’m not sure, driving home
later that night, still smelling the pallid citrus,
whether it’s merely hallucination, the way
her memory inhabits me; or if being
in that same room, inhaling
that same air, made some of her
part of me. 
                  And whose veins
are these, beginning to twitch?

"When I hit her on the head, it was good, 
and then I did it to her a couple of times,—
but it was funny,—afterwards,
it was as if somebody else did it... 
Everything flat, without sharpness, richness or line. 
Still, I liked to drive past the woods where she lay,
tell the old lady and the kids I had to take a piss,
hop out and do it to her... 
The whole buggy of them waiting for me
                                                             made me feel good;
but still, just like I knew all along,
                                                   she didn't move. 
When the body got too discomposed,
I'd just jack off, letting it fall on her... 
—It sounds crazy, but I tell you
sometimes it was beautiful—; I don't know how
to say it, but for a minute, everything was possible—;
and then,
then,—
            well, like I said, she didn't move: and I saw,
under me, a little girl was just lying there in the mud: 
and I knew I couldn't have done that,—
somebody else had to have done that,—
standing above her there,
                                       in those ordinary, shitty leaves... 
—One time, I went to see Dad in a motel where he was
staying with a woman; but she was gone;
you could smell the wine in the air; and he started,
real embarrassing, to cry...
                                           He was still a little drunk,
and he asked me to forgive him for
all he hadn't done—; but, What the shit?
Who would have wanted to stay with Mom? with bastards
not even his own kids? 
                                  I got in the truck, and started to drive,
and saw a little girl—
who I picked up, hit on the head, and
screwed, and screwed, and screwed, and screwed, then 
buried,
          in the garden of the motel... 
—You see, ever since I was a kid I wanted
to feel things make sense: I remember 
looking out the window of my room back home,—
and being almost suffocated by the asphalt;
and grass; and trees; and glass;
just there, just there, doing nothing!
not saying anything! filling me up—
but also being a wall; dead, and stopping me;
—how I wanted to see beneath it, cut 
beneath it, and make it
somehow, come alive... 
                                    The salt of the earth;
Mom once said, 'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth...'
—That night, at that Twenty-nine Palms Motel
I had passed a million times on the road, everything 
fit together; was alright;
it seemed like
                     everything had to be there, like I had spent years
trying, and at last finally finished drawing this
                                                                           huge circle... 
—But then, suddenly I knew
somebody else did it, some bastard
had hurt a little girl—; the motel
                                                      I could see again, it had been 
itself all the time, a lousy
pile of bricks, plaster, that didn't seem to
have to be there,—but was, just by chance... 
—Once, on the farm, when I was a kid,
I was screwing a goat; and the rope around his neck
when he tried to get away
pulled tight;—and just when I came,
he died...
                        I came back the next day; jacked off over his body;
but it didn't do any good... 
Mom once said:
'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth, and grows kids.' 
I tried so hard to come; more pain than anything else;
but didn't do any good... 
—About six months ago, I heard Dad remarried,
so I drove over to Connecticut to see him and see
if he was happy.
                        She was twenty-five years younger than him:
she had lots of little kids, and I don't know why,
I felt shaky...
                      I stopped in front of the address; and
snuck up to the window to look in...
                                                      —There he was, a kid
six months old on his lap, laughing
and bouncing the kid, happy in his old age
to play the papa after years of sleeping around,—
it twisted me up...
                            To think that what he wouldn't give me,
                            he wanted to give them... 
                   I could have killed the bastard... 
—Naturally, I just got right back in the car,
and believe me, was determined, determined,
to head straight for home... 
                                          but the more I drove,
I kept thinking about getting a girl,
and the more I thought I shouldn't do it,
the more I had to— 
                            I saw her coming out of the movies,
saw she was alone, and
kept circling the blocks as she walked along them,
saying, 'You're going to leave her alone.'
'You're going to leave her alone.' 
                                                   —The woods were scary!
As the seasons changed, and you saw more and more
of the skull show through, the nights became clearer,
and the buds,—erect, like nipples... 
—But then, one night,
nothing worked...
                                    Nothing in the sky
would blur like I wanted it to;
and I couldn't, couldn't,
get it to seem to me
that somebody else did it... 
I tried, and tried, but there was just me there,
and her, and the sharp trees
saying, 'That's you standing there.
                                                    You're...
                                                                  just you.' 
                                 I hope I fry. 
—Hell came when I saw
                                     MYSELF...
                                                      and couldn't stand
what I see..."

for Yehuda Amichai



Though you live in a little country,   
crammed and crisscrossed with debris,   
the past oppressive many times over—
where you buy your grapes David, pausing,
eyes a fiery dark girl, a lusty song   
riding his breath, the old dance urgent   
at his body; where you buy your bread   
Christ, stumbling, stoops to heavy lumber—
you insist on your own loves and griefs,   
on living your own life.
                                           So you love
this city, but mainly as it goes on   
living its own life, across its roofs
the lines flapping, not gaudy banners,   
but sheets and diapers, pants and slips,   
as if rehearsing private pleasures. 
And though you know you cannot win,   
you play the game with all the skill   
and love that you can muster, hoping   
to keep it, keep it going, whatever   
the fierceness in it, while you learn   
the repertoire of your opponent’s wrist,   
the repertoire your own commands,   
with every stroke surprising you,   
as in a woman’s glance the abundance   
glinting of her passion stored away. 
Those opposing roles, victor, victim   
both, when they require re-enacting,
the moon as ever plays the luminous dome   
above your god-and-man-scarred rock,   
responsive to each nuance of the light   
informing it with this, the latest scene. 
The sweat you’ve shared between you,   
juices drying on your hands and moon-
lit belly, swirls out of the rutted, stain-
stiff sheets a fragrance stronger, more   
anointing, than the myrrh, the frank-
incense the magi brought, a gleam
that would eclipse their beaten gold.

my sister Josephine
born july in '29
and dead these 15 years
who carried a book
on every stroll. 
when daddy was dying
she left the streets
and moved back home
to tend him. 
her pimp came too
her Diamond Dick
and they would take turns
reading 
a bible aloud through the house.
when you poem this
and you will she would say
remember the Book of Job. 
happy birthday and hope
to you Josephine
one of the easts
most wanted. 
may heaven be filled
with literate men
may they bed you
with respect.

Soul and race
are private dominions,   
memories and modal
songs, a tenor blossoming,
which would paint suffering   
a clear color but is not in   
this Victorian house
without oil in zero degree
weather and a forty-mile-an-hour wind;
it is all a well-knit family:    a love supreme.
Oak leaves pile up on walkway
and steps, catholic as apples
in a special mist of clear white   
children who love my children.   
I play “Alabama”
on a warped record player
skipping the scratches
on your faces over the fibrous   
conical hairs of plastic
under the wooden floors. 
Dreaming on a train from New York   
to Philly, you hand out six
notes which become an anthem
to our memories of you:
oak, birch, maple,
apple, cocoa, rubber.
For this reason Martin is dead;
for this reason Malcolm is dead;
for this reason Coltrane is dead;
in the eyes of my first son are the browns   
of these men and their music.

A heritage of a sort.
A heritage of comradeship and suffocation. 
The bawling pit-hooter and the god’s   
explosive foray, vengeance, before retreating   
to his throne of sulphur. 
Now this black-robed god of fossils
and funerals,
petrifier of underground forests
and flowers,
emerges with his grim retinue
past a pony’s skeleton, past human skulls,
into his half-propped up, empty, carbon colony. 
Above, on the brutalised,
unstitched side of a Welsh mountain,
it has to be someone from somewhere else   
who will sing solo 
not of the marasmus of the Valleys,   
the pit-wheels that do not turn,   
the pump-house abandoned; 
nor of how, after a half-mile fall   
regiments of miners’ lamps   
no longer, midge-like,
rise and slip and bob. 
Only someone uncommitted,   
someone from somewhere else,   
panorama-high on a coal-tip,   
may jubilantly laud
the re-entry of the exiled god   
into his shadowless kingdom. 
He, drunk with methane,
raising a man’s femur like a sceptre;
she, his ravished queen,
admiring the blood-stained black roses
that could not thrive on the plains of Enna.

It lies not in our power to love or hate, For will in us is overruled by fate. When two are stripped, long ere the course begin, We wish that one should lose, the other win; And one especially do we affect Of two gold ingots, like in each respect: The reason no man knows; let it suffice What we behold is censured by our eyes. Where both deliberate, the love is slight: Who ever loved, that loved not at first sight?

When the swordsman fell in Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai
in the gray rain,
in the Cinemascope and the Tokugawa dynasty,
he fell straight as a pine, he fell
as Ajax fell in Homer
in chanted dactyls and the tree was so huge
the woodsman returned for two days
to that lucky place before he was done with the sawing
and on the third day he brought his uncle. 
They stacked logs in the resinous air,
hacking the small limbs off,
tying those bundles separately.
The slabs near the root
were quartered and still they were awkwardly large;
the logs from the midtree they halved:
ten bundles and four great piles of fragrant wood,
moons and quarter moons and half moons
ridged by the saw’s tooth. 
The woodsman and the old man his uncle
are standing in midforest
on a floor of pine silt and spring mud.
They have stopped working
because they are tired and because
I have imagined no pack animal   
or primitive wagon. They are too canny
to call in neighbors and come home
with a few logs after three days’ work.
They are waiting for me to do something   
or for the overseer of the Great Lord
to come and arrest them. 
How patient they are!
The old man smokes a pipe and spits.
The young man is thinking he would be rich
if he were already rich and had a mule.
Ten days of hauling
and on the seventh day they’ll probably
be caught, go home empty-handed
or worse. I don’t know
whether they’re Japanese or Mycenaean
and there’s nothing I can do.
The path from here to that village
is not translated. A hero, dying,
gives off stillness to the air.
A man and a woman walk from the movies
to the house in the silence of separate fidelities.
There are limits to imagination.

I hear it at night
when I turn out the light.
It’s that creature who’s under my bed.
He won’t go away.
He’s determined to stay.
But I wish he would beat it, instead. 
I told him to go,
but he shook his head no.
He was worse than an unwelcome guest.
I gave him a nudge,
but he still wouldn’t budge.
It was hard to get rid of the pest. 
So I fired one hundred
round cannon balls plundered
from pirate ships sailing the seas.
But he caught them barehanded
and quickly grandstanded
by juggling them nice as you please. 
The creature was slick.
He was clever and quick.
This called for a drastic maneuver.
So I lifted my spread
and charged under the bed
with the roar of my mother’s new Hoover. 
But he snorted his nose
and sucked in the long hose,
the canister, cord, and the plug,
and vacuumed in dust   
till I thought he would bust
then he blew it all over the rug. 
Now this made me sore,
so I cried, “This is war!”
and sent in a contingent of fleas,
an army of ants
dressed in camouflage pants
followed closely by big killer bees.
But he welcomed them in
With a sly, crafty grin,
And he ate them with crackers and cheese. 
I screamed, “That’s enough!”
It was time to get tough.
“You asked for it, Creature,” I said,
as I picked up and threw,
with an aim sure and true,
my gym sneaker under the bed. 
With each whiff of the sneaker
the creature grew weaker.
He staggered out gasping for air.
He coughed and he sneezed
and collapsed with a wheeze
and accused me of not playing fair. 
Then holding his nose
with his twelve hairy toes,
the creature curled into a ball,
and rolled ’cross the floor
smashing right through the door.
I was rid of him once and for all. 
The very next night
when I turned out the light
and was ready to lay down my head,
I heard my kid brother
cry out to my mother,
“Hey, Ma, something’s under my bed.”


^^EOP^^

There are diagrams on stilts all wired together
Over the hill and the wind and out of sight.
There is a scar in the trees where they walk away
Beyond me. There are signs of something
Nearly God (or at least most curious)
About them. I think those diagrams are not
At rest.
            I think they are a way of ciphering God:
He is the hugest socket and all his miracles
Are wired behind him scarring the hill and the wind
As the waterfall flies roaring to his city
On the open palms of the diagram.
                                                   There is
Shining, I suppose, in that city at night
And measure for miracles, and wheels whirling
So quick-silver they seem to be going backwards.
And there’s a miracle already. But I
Went naked through his wood of diagrams
On a day of the rain beside me to his city. 
When I kissed that socket with my wet lip
My teeth fell out, my fingers sprouted chives,
And what a bald head chewed on my sick heart!


^^EOP^^

When I see a couple of kids
And guess he’s fucking her and she’s   
Taking pills or wearing a diaphragm,   
I know this is paradise 
Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives—   
Bonds and gestures pushed to one side
Like an outdated combine harvester,
And everyone young going down the long slide 
To happiness, endlessly. I wonder if   
Anyone looked at me, forty years back,   
And thought, That’ll be the life;
No God any more, or sweating in the dark

^^EOP^^

Or will we be lost forever? 
In the silence of the last breath
Not taken 
The blue sweep of your arm like a dancer
Clowning, in wrinkled pajamas, 
Across the sky the abrupt
Brief zigzag of a jay... 
All night the whiteness
And all day. 
Once we have been lifted up
Into empty morning like ice 
In the darkness of these white fields 
Neither the ghost tracks of skis
Nor steel skates will wake us 
Where are we looking for each other, separated 
On the opposite hillside I see you
Miles away from me, a dot 
Of faint color reddening, small bruised warmth
Opening its cranberry mouth and saying, 
What are you saying? 
                                        * 
Under a cold blanket 
An immense loneliness stretches
In every direction with no fences. 
A few sticks tweak the crusted snow: 
Thin remnants of an army
Of lost soldiers. 
I see footsteps ahead of me but whose 
And where will they lead me, parallel
Or converging? Is it not possible there will be one jet trail 
That will not vanish, 
Two phantom ribbons unfolding
That will not feather themselves away? 
                                       * 
Wrapped in our white parkas 
In what shifting laminations, snowflakes
That mean nothing, transparent eyes spitting, 
What glacier will we choose to lie on,
In what igloo rest 
Barely breathing, in an air pocket
Just below the surface 
Rustling beneath blizzards 
Where is your foot, most beautiful
With blue toenails 
I will be looking for it always 
Wherever it is, next to me
In the darkness 
Of rumpled white sheets,
Pale siftings, clouds 
Sudden scarves of ourselves gusting
Loose, sandpapery as snow lifting 
In what chill citadel of ice crystals
Will I find you?


^^EOP^^

To look at this fictitious steed
You’d think some mixed-up farmer
Had crossed an eagle with a horse.
It carries knights in armor
Through cloud fields at terrific speed.
I wish the Hippogriff
Would take me for a ride. Of course
It’s not real.
                     But oh, if . . .!

While it is true

That in the wake of a

Surely I am not

Why, LBJ has made it   
quite clear to me   
He doesn’t give a
Good goddamn what I think
(else why would he continue to masterbate in public?) 
Rhythm and Blues is not
The downfall of a great civilization
And I expect you to
Realize
That the Temptations   
have no connection with   
The CIA 
We must move on to   
the true issues of   
Our time
like the mini-skirt

And perhaps take a   
Closer look at
Flour power 
It is for Us
to lead our people   
out of the
Wein-Bars
   into the streets
into the streets
(for safety reasons only)   
Lord knows we don’t   
Want to lose the

of our Jewish friends 
So let us work
for our day of Presence   
When Stokely is in
The Black House
And all will be right with   
Our World

One Christmastime Fats Waller in a fur coat
Rolled beaming from a taxicab with two pretty girls   
Each at an arm as he led them in a thick downy snowfall 
Across Thirty-Fourth Street into the busy crowd
Shopping at Macy’s: perfume, holly, snowflake displays.
Chimes rang for change. In Toys, where my mother worked 
Over her school vacation, the crowd swelled and stood
Filling the aisles, whispered at the fringes, listening
To the sounds of the large, gorgeously dressed man, 
His smile bemused and exalted, lips boom-booming a bold
Bass line as he improvised on an expensive, tinkly
Piano the size of a lady’s jewel box or a wedding cake. 
She put into my heart this scene from the romance of Joy,
Co-authored by her and the movies, like her others–
My father making the winning basket at the buzzer 
And punching the enraged gambler who came onto the court–
The brilliant black and white of the movies, texture
Of wet snowy fur, the taxi’s windshield, piano keys, 
Reflections that slid over the thick brass baton
That worked the elevator. Happiness needs a setting:
Shepherds and shepherdesses in the grass, kids in a store, 
The back room of Carly’s parents’ shop, record-player
And paper streamers twisted in two colors: what I felt
Dancing close one afternoon with a thin blonde girl 
Was my amazing good luck, the pleased erection
Stretching and stretching at the idea She likes me,
She likes it

We are walking our very public attraction
through eighteenth-century Philadelphia.
I am simultaneously butch girlfriend
and suburban child on a school trip,
Independence Hall, 1775, home
to the Second Continental Congress.
Although she is wearing her leather jacket,
although we have made love for the first time
in a hotel room on Rittenhouse Square,
I am preparing my teenage escape from Philadelphia,
from Elfreth’s Alley, the oldest continuously occupied
residential street in the nation,
from Carpenters’ Hall, from Congress Hall,
from Graff House where the young Thomas
Jefferson lived, summer of 1776. In my starched shirt
and waistcoat, in my leggings and buckled shoes,
in postmodern drag, as a young eighteenth-century statesman,
I am seventeen and tired of fighting for freedom
and the rights of men. I am already dreaming of Boston—
city of women, demonstrations, and revolution
on a grand and personal scale. 
                                                       Then the maître d’
is pulling out our chairs for brunch, we have the
surprised look of people who have been kissing
and now find themselves dressed and dining
in a Locust Street townhouse turned café,
who do not know one another very well, who continue
with optimism to pursue relationship. Eternity
may simply be our mortal default mechanism
set on hope despite all evidence. In this mood,
I roll up my shirtsleeves and she touches my elbow.
I refuse the seedy view from the hotel window.
I picture instead their silver inkstands,
the hoopskirt factory on Arch Street,
the Wireworks, their eighteenth-century herb gardens,
their nineteenth-century row houses restored
with period door knockers.
Step outside.
We have been deeded the largest landscaped space
within a city anywhere in the world. In Fairmount Park,
on horseback, among the ancient ginkgoes, oaks, persimmons,
and magnolias, we are seventeen and imperishable, cutting classes
May of our senior year. And I am happy as the young
Tom Jefferson, unbuttoning my collar, imagining his power,
considering my healthy body, how I might use it in the service
of the country of my pleasure.

It used to be more private—just the
immediate family gathered after mass,
the baptismal font at the rear
of the church tiny as a bird bath.
The priest would ladle a few teaspoons’
tepid holy water on the bundled baby’s
forehead, make a crack about the halo
being too tight as the new soul wailed.
We’d go home to pancakes and eggs. 
These days it’s a big Holy-wood production—
midmass, the giant altar rolls back to reveal
a Jacuzzi tub surrounded by potted palms.
The priest hikes up his chasuble, steps
barefoot out of his black leather loafers
and wades in like a newfangled John as
organ music swells and the baby-bearing families
line up like jumbo jets ready for takeoff. 
But when the godparents handed my niece’s newborn
naked to their parish priest, and he dunked her
into the Jacuzzi’s bath-warm holy water,
her little one grew so calm and blissful she
pooped—not a smelly three-days’ worth, explosive
diaper load, but enough to notice. As the godparents
scooped the turds with a handkerchief,
the savvy priest pretended he hadn’t seen,
swept through the fouled water with his palm
before the next baby in line was submerged. 
After mass, my niece sat speechless,
red-faced, not knowing what to say—
or whether—as church ladies, friends, and
family members presented one by one to
the tub where the babies had been
baptized. As they knelt and bowed
and dipped their fingers in,
and blessed themselves.


^^EOP^^

It’s alot like a cave full of pictures
& black & white checked flags
you may overdose on caffeine
it’s the closest restaurant to our house
maybe five miles, it’s very cheap
you can go there when you have almost no money
they let you use the telephone
i can get steak tartare there for $2.25
but i’ve never called it that
just raw hamburger with an egg yolk,
pickle relish & garlic powder plus
the celtic salt i bring along
the owner, h (after whom the h-burger is named)
is loquacious, surprising, has a santa claus belly & wears suspenders
there’s ashtrays everywhere & a great old pinball machine
it’s like east nassau but it’s in west lebanon i think
you can always talk about the weather & hunting
the clientele is open-minded as are the waitress & waiter
who kneels when he takes your order
during hunting season it opens at 4:30 a.m.
it’s for sale but that’s not quite serious
h’s wife thinks he spends too much time there (which he does)
so she started calling him by their dog’s name, peaches
h is a big fan of northern exposure, oh & i
forgot to mention the biscuits & sausage gravy
which are genuine, greyish & great. recently
h got a smoker & this year we’ll go to the new year’s
eve party & eat stuffed shrimp and/or lobster

[1]
The Governor your husband lived so long   
moved you not, restless, waiting for him? Still,   
you were a patient woman.—
I seem to see you pause here still:
Sylvester, Quarles, in moments odd you pored   
before a fire at, bright eyes on the Lord,   
all the children still.
‘Simon ...’ Simon will listen while you read a Song. 
    [2]
Outside the New World winters in grand dark   
white air lashing high thro’ the virgin stands
foxes down foxholes sigh,
surely the English heart quails, stunned.
I doubt if Simon than this blast, that sea,
spares from his rigour for your poetry
more. We are on each other’s hands
who care. Both of our worlds unhanded us. Lie stark, 
    [3]
thy eyes look to me mild. Out of maize & air   
your body’s made, and moves. I summon, see,
from the centuries it.
I think you won’t stay. How do we   
linger, diminished, in our lovers’ air,   
implausibly visible, to whom, a year,   
years, over interims; or not;
to a long stranger; or not; shimmer & disappear. 
    [4]
Jaw-ript, rot with its wisdom, rending then;
then not. When the mouth dies, who misses you?
Your master never died,
Simon ah thirty years past you—
Pockmarkt & westward staring on a haggard deck
it seems I find you, young. I come to check,
I come to stay with you,
and the Governor, & Father, & Simon, & the huddled men. 
    [5]
By the week we landed we were, most, used up.   
Strange ships across us, after a fortnight’s winds   
unfavouring, frightened us;
bone-sad cold, sleet, scurvy; so were ill
many as one day we could have no sermons;
broils, quelled; a fatherless child unkennelled; vermin   
crowding & waiting: waiting.
And the day itself he leapt ashore young Henry Winthrop 
    [6]
(delivered from the waves; because he found
off their wigwams, sharp-eyed, a lone canoe
across a tidal river,
that water glittered fair & blue
& narrow, none of the other men could swim   
and the plantation’s prime theft up to him,
shouldered on a glad day
hard on the glorious feasting of thanksgiving) drowned. 
    [7]
How long with nothing in the ruinous heat,   
clams & acorns stomaching, distinction perishing,   
at which my heart rose,
with brackish water, we would sing.
When whispers knew the Governor’s last bread   
was browning in his oven, we were discourag’d.   
The Lady Arbella dying—
dyings—at which my heart    rose, but I did submit. 
    [8]
That beyond the Atlantic wound our woes enlarge   
is hard, hard that starvation burnishes our fear,   
but I do gloss for You.
Strangers & pilgrims fare we here,
declaring we seek a City. Shall we be deceived?
I know whom I have trusted, & whom I have believed,   
and that he is able to
keep    that I have committed to his charge. 
    [9]
Winter than summer worse, that first, like a file   
on a quick, or the poison suck of a thrilled tooth;   
and still we may unpack.
Wolves & storms among, uncouth
board-pieces, boxes, barrels vanish, grow
houses, rise. Motes that hop in sunlight slow   
indoors, and I am Ruth
away: open my mouth, my eyes wet: I wóuld smile: 
    [10]
vellum I palm, and dream. Their forest dies
to greensward, privets, elms & towers, whence   
a nightingale is throbbing.
Women sleep sound. I was happy once . .   
(Something keeps on not happening; I shrink?)   
These minutes all their passions & powers sink   
and I am not one chance
for an unknown cry or a flicker of unknown eyes. 
    [11]
Chapped souls ours, by the day Spring’s strong winds swelled,   
Jack’s pulpits arched, more glad. The shawl I pinned   
flaps like a shooting soul
might in such weather Heaven send.
Succumbing half, in spirit, to a salmon sash
I prod the nerveless novel succotash—
I must be disciplined,
in arms, against that one, and our dissidents, and myself. 
    [12]
Versing, I shroud among the dynasties;
quaternion on quaternion, tireless I phrase
anything past, dead, far,
sacred, for a barbarous place.
—To please your wintry father? all this bald
abstract didactic rime I read appalled
harassed for your fame
mistress neither of fiery nor velvet verse, on your knees 
    [13]
hopeful & shamefast, chaste, laborious, odd,
whom the sea tore. —The damned roar with loss,   
so they hug & are mean
with themselves, and I cannot be thus.
Why then do I repine, sick, bad, to long
after what must not be? I lie wrong
once more. For at fourteen
I found my heart more carnal and sitting loose from God, 
    [14]
vanity & the follies of youth took hold of me;   
then the pox blasted, when the Lord returned.   
That year for my sorry face
so-much-older Simon burned,
so Father smiled, with love. Their will be done.   
He to me ill lingeringly, learning to shun
a bliss, a lightning blood
vouchsafed, what did seem life. I kissed his Mystery. 
    [15]
Drydust in God’s eye the aquavivid skin   
of Simon snoring lit with fountaining dawn   
when my eyes unlid, sad.
John Cotton shines on Boston’s sin—   
I ám drawn, in pieties that seem
the weary drizzle of an unremembered dream.   
Women have gone mad   
at twenty-one. Ambition mines, atrocious, in. 
    [16]
Food endless, people few, all to be done.
As pippins roast, the question of the wolves
turns & turns.
Fangs of a wolf will keep, the neck
round of a child, that child brave. I remember who   
in meeting smiled & was punisht, and I know who   
whispered & was stockt.
We lead a thoughtful life. But Boston’s cage we shun. 
    [17]
The winters close, Springs open, no child stirs   
under my withering heart, O seasoned heart
God grudged his aid.
All things else soil like a shirt.
Simon is much away. My executive stales.
The town came through for the cartway by the pales,   
but my patience is short.
I revolt from, I am like, these savage foresters 
    [18]
whose passionless dicker in the shade, whose glance   
impassive & scant, belie their murderous cries
when quarry seems to show.
Again I must have been wrong, twice.
Unwell in a new way. Can that begin?
God brandishes. O love, O I love. Kin,
gather. My world is strange
and merciful, ingrown months, blessing a swelling trance. 
    [19]
So squeezed, wince you I scream? I love you & hate   
off with you. Ages! Useless. Below my waist   
he has me in Hell’s vise.
Stalling. He let go. Come back: brace
me somewhere. No. No. Yes! everything down   
hardens I press with horrible joy down   
my back cracks like a wrist
shame I am voiding oh behind it is too late 
    [20]
hide me forever I work thrust I must free
now I all muscles & bones concentrate
what is living from dying?
Simon I must leave you so untidy
Monster you are killing me Be sure
I’ll have you later Women do endure
I can can no longer
and it passes the wretched trap whelming and I am me 
    [21]
drencht & powerful, I did it with my body!   
One proud tug greens heaven. Marvellous,   
unforbidding Majesty.
Swell, imperious bells. I fly.
Mountainous, woman not breaks and will bend:   
sways God nearby: anguish comes to an end.   
Blossomed Sarah, and I
blossom. Is that thing alive? I hear a famisht howl. 
    [22]
Beloved household, I am Simon’s wife,
and the mother of Samuel—whom greedy yet I miss   
out of his kicking place.
More in some ways I feel at a loss,
freer. Cantabanks & mummers, nears
longing for you. Our chopping scores my ears,   
our costume bores my eyes.
St. George to the good sword, rise! chop-logic’s rife 
    [23]
& fever & Satan & Satan’s ancient fere.
Pioneering is not feeling well,
not Indians, beasts.
Not all their riddling can forestall
one leaving. Sam, your uncle has had to
go fróm us to live with God. ‘Then Aunt went too?’
Dear, she does wait still.
Stricken: ‘Oh. Then he takes    us one by one.’ My dear. 
    [24]
Forswearing it otherwise, they starch their minds.   
Folkmoots, & blether, blether. John Cotton rakes   
to the synod of Cambridge.
Down from my body my legs flow,
out from it arms wave, on it my head shakes.   
Now Mistress Hutchinson rings forth a call—
should she? many creep out at a broken wall—
affirming the Holy Ghost
dwells in one justified. Factioning passion blinds 
    [25]
all to her good, all    can she be exiled?
Bitter sister, victim! I miss you.
—I miss you, Anne,
day or night weak as a child,
tender & empty, doomed, quick to no tryst.   
—I hear you. Be kind, you who leaguer
my image in the mist.
—Be kind you, to one unchained eager far & wild 
    [26]
and if, 0 my love, my heart is breaking, please   
neglect my cries and I will spare you. Deep   
in Time’s grave, Love’s, you lie still.
Lie still. —Now? That happy shape
my forehead had under my most long, rare,   
ravendark, hidden, soft bodiless hair
you award me still.
You must not love me, but    I do not bid you cease. 
    [27]
Veiled my eyes, attending. How can it be I?   
Moist, with parted lips, I listen, wicked.   
I shake in the morning & retch.
Brood I do on myself naked.
A fading world I dust, with fingers new.
—I have earned the right to be alone with you.   
—What right can that be?
Convulsing, if you love, enough, like a sweet lie. 
    [28]
Not that, I know, you can. This cratered skin,
like the crabs & shells of my Palissy ewer, touch!   
Oh, you do, you do?
Falls on me what I like a witch,
for lawless holds, annihilations of law
which Time and he and man abhor, foresaw:
sharper than what my Friend
brought me for my revolt when I moved smooth & thin, 
    [29]
faintings black, rigour, chilling, brown
parching, back, brain burning, the grey pocks   
itch, a manic stench
of pustules snapping, pain floods the palm,
sleepless, or a red shaft with a dreadful start   
rides at the chapel, like a slipping heart.
My soul strains in one qualm
ah but this is not to save me but to throw me down. 
    [30]
And out of this I lull. It lessens. Kiss me.   
That once. As sings out up in sparkling dark   
a trail of a star & dies,
while the breath flutters, sounding, mark,   
so shorn ought such caresses to us be   
who, deserving nothing, flush and flee   
the darkness of that light,
a lurching frozen from a warm dream. Talk to me. 
    [31]
—It is Spring’s New England. Pussy willows wedge   
up in the wet. Milky crestings, fringed
yellow, in heaven, eyed
by the melting hand-in-hand or mere
desirers single, heavy-footed, rapt,
make surge poor human hearts. Venus is trapt—
the hefty pike shifts, sheer—
in Orion blazing. Warblings, odours, nudge to an edge— 
    [32]
—Ravishing, ha, what crouches outside ought,   
flamboyant, ill, angelic. Often, now,   
I am afraid of you.
I am a sobersides; I know.
I want to take you for my lover. —Do.   
—I hear a madness. Harmless I to you   
am not, not I? —No.
—I cannot but be. Sing a concord of our thought. 
    [33]
—Wan dolls in indigo on gold: refrain
my western lust. I am drowning in this past.   
I lose sight of you
who mistress me from air. Unbraced
in delirium of the grand depths, giving away   
haunters what kept me, I breathe solid spray.   
—I am losing you!
Straiten me on. —I suffered living like a stain: 
    [34]
I trundle the bodies, on the iron bars,   
over that fire backward & forth; they burn;
bits fall. I wonder if I killed them. Women serve my turn.
—Dreams! You are good. —No. —Dense with hardihood   
the wicked are dislodged, and lodged the good.
In green space we are safe.
God awaits us (but I    am yielding) who Hell wars. 
    [35]
—I cannot feel myself God waits. He flies
nearer a kindly world; or he is flown.
One Saturday’s rescue
won’t show. Man is entirely alone
may be. I am a man of griefs & fits
trying to be my friend. And the brown smock splits,   
down the pale flesh a gash
broadens and Time holds up your heart against my eyes. 
    [36]
—Hard and divided heaven! creases me. Shame   
is failing. My breath is scented, and I throw   
hostile glances towards God.
Crumpling plunge of a pestle, bray:
sin cross & opposite, wherein I survive   
nightmares of Eden. Reaches foul & live   
he for me, this soul
to crunch, a minute tangle of eternal flame. 
    [37]
I fear Hell’s hammer-wind. But fear does wane.   
Death’s blossoms grain my hair; I cannot live.
A black joy clashes
joy, in twilight. The Devil said
‘I will deal toward her softly, and her enchanting cries   
will fool the horns of Adam.’ Father of lies,
a male great pestle smashes
small women swarming towards the mortar’s rim in vain. 
    [38]
I see the cruel spread Wings black with saints!   
Silky my breasts not his, mine, mine, to withhold   
or tender, tender.
I am sifting, nervous, and bold.
The light is changing. Surrender this loveliness   
you cannot make me do. But I will. Yes.   
What horror, down stormy air,
warps towards me? My threatening promise faints— 
    [39]
torture me, Father, lest not I be thine!   
Tribunal terrible & pure, my God,
mercy for him and me.
Faces half-fanged, Christ drives abroad,
and though the crop hopes, Jane is so slipshod   
I cry. Evil dissolves, & love, like foam;
that love. Prattle of children powers me home,   
my heart claps like the swan’s
under a frenzy of who love me & who shine. 
    [40]
As a canoe slides by on one strong stroke   
hope his hélp not I, who do hardly bear   
his gift still. But whisper
I am not utterly. I pare
an apple for my pipsqueak Mercy and   
she runs & all need naked apples, fanned   
their tinier envies.
Vomitings, trots, rashes. Can be hope a cloak? 
    [41]
for the man with cropt ears glares. My fingers tighten   
my skirt. I pass. Alas! I pity all.
Shy, shy, with mé, Dorothy.
Moonrise, and frightening hoots. ‘Mother,
how long will I be dead?’ Our friend the owl   
vanishes, darling, but your homing soul
retires on Heaven, Mercy:
not we one instant die, only our dark does lighten. 
    [42]
When by me in the dusk my child sits down   
I am myself. Simon, if it’s that loose,
let me wiggle it out.
You’ll get a bigger one there, & bite.
How they loft, how their sizes delight and grate.   
The proportioned, spiritless poems accumulate.   
And they publish them
away in brutish London, for a hollow crown. 
    [43]
Father is not himself. He keeps his bed,
and threw a saffron scum Thursday. God-forsaken words
escaped him raving. Save,
Lord, thy servant zealous & just.
Sam he saw back from Harvard. He did scold   
his secting enemies. His stomach is cold
while we drip, while
my baby John breaks out. O far from where he bred! 
    [44]
Bone of moaning: sung Where he has gone
a thousand summers by truth-hallowed souls;   
be still. Agh, he is gone!
Where? I know. Beyond the shoal.
Still-all a Christian daughter grinds her teeth   
a little. This our land has ghosted with   
our dead: I am at home.
Finish, Lord, in me this work thou hast begun. 
    [45]
And they tower, whom the pear-tree lured
to let them fall, fierce mornings they reclined   
down the brook-bank to the east
fishing for shiners with a crookt pin,
wading, dams massing, well, and Sam’s to be   
a doctor in Boston. After the divisive sea,   
and death’s first feast,
and the galled effort on the wilderness endured, 
    [46]
Arminians, and the King bore against us;
of an ‘inward light’ we hear with horror.
Whose fan is in his hand
and he will thoroughly purge his floor,
come towards me. I have what licks the joints   
and bites the heart, which winter more appoints.   
Iller I, oftener.
Hard at the outset; in the ending thus hard, thus? 
    [47]
Sacred & unutterable Mind
flashing thorough the universe one thought,
I do wait without peace.
In the article of death I budge.
Eat my sore breath, Black Angel. Let me die.
Body a-drain, when will you be dry
and countenance my speed
to Heaven’s springs? lest stricter writhings have me declined. 
    [48]
‘What are those pictures in the air at night,   
Mother?’ Mercy did ask. Space charged with faces   
day & night! I place
a goatskin’s fetor, and sweat: fold me
in savoury arms. Something is shaking, wrong.   
He smells the musket and lifts it. It is long.   
It points at my heart.
Missed he must have. In the gross storm of sunlight 
    [49]
I sniff a fire burning without outlet,
consuming acrid its own smoke. It’s me.
Ruined laughter sounds
outside. Ah but I waken, free.
And so I am about again. I hagged
a fury at the short maid, whom tongues tagged,   
and I am sorry. Once
less I was anxious when more passioned to upset 
    [50]
the mansion & the garden & the beauty of God.   
Insectile unreflective busyness
blunts & does amend.
Hangnails, piles, fibs, life’s also.
But we are that from which draws back a thumb.   
The seasons stream and, somehow, I am become   
an old woman. It’s so:
I look. I bear to look. Strokes once more his rod. 
    [51]
My window gives on the graves, in our great new house   
(how many burned?) upstairs, among the elms.   
I lie, & endure, & wonder.
A haze slips sometimes over my dreams   
and holiness on horses’ bells shall stand.   
Wandering pacemaker, unsteadying friend,   
in a redskin calm I wait:
beat when you will our end. Sinkings & droopings drowse. 
    [52]
They say thro’ the fading winter Dorothy fails,
my second, who than I bore one more, nine;
and I see her inearthed. I linger.
Seaborn she wed knelt before Simon;
Simon I, and linger. Black-yellow seething, vast
it lies fróm me, mine: all they look aghast.
It will be a glorious arm.
Docile I watch. My wreckt chest hurts when Simon pales. 
    [53]
In the yellowing days your faces wholly fail,   
at Fall’s onset. Solemn voices fade.
I feel no coverlet.
Light notes leap, a beckon, swaying
the tilted, sickening ear within. I’ll—I’ll—
I am closed & coming. Somewhere! I defile   
wide as a cloud, in a cloud,
unfit, desirous, glad—even the singings veil— 
    [54]
—You are not ready? You áre ready. Pass,
as shadow gathers shadow in the welling night.   
Fireflies of childhood torch
you down. We commit our sister down.
One candle mourn by, which a lover gave,
the use’s edge and order of her grave.
Quiet? Moisture shoots.
Hungry throngs collect. They sword into the carcass. 
    [55]
Headstones stagger under great draughts of time   
after heads pass out, and their world must reel   
speechless, blind in the end
about its chilling star: thrift tuft,
whin cushion—nothing. Already with the wounded flying   
dark air fills, I am a closet of secrets dying,   
races murder, foxholes hold men,
reactor piles wage slow upon the wet brain rime. 
    [56]
I must pretend to leave you. Only you draw off   
a benevolent phantom. I say you seem to me
drowned towns off England,
featureless as those myriads
who what bequeathed save fire-ash, fossils, burled   
in the open river-drifts of the Old World?
Simon lived on for years.
I renounce not even ragged glances, small teeth, nothing, 
    [57]
O all your ages at the mercy of my loves
together lie at once, forever or
so long as I happen.
In the rain of pain & departure, still
Love has no body and presides the sun,
and elf’s from silence melody. I run.
Hover, utter, still,
a sourcing    whom my lost candle like the firefly loves.

these hips are big hips
they need space to
move around in.
they don't fit into little
petty places. these hips
are free hips.
they don't like to be held back.
these hips have never been enslaved,   
they go where they want to go
they do what they want to do.
these hips are mighty hips.
these hips are magic hips.
i have known them
to put a spell on a man and
spin him like a top!

for Paul Cook



The illegal ditch riders of the previous night
Will deliver ice today.
The barbers up in the trees are Chinese.
They climb with bright cleats, bearing machetes—
It’s a season
Of low self-esteem for date palms on the street. 
My visitor was at the door yesterday.
In a blue sere of a sucker suit.
An I Like Ike button
On the lapel. Holding a cup of sawdust.
He breathed through his eyes, crusted
With pollen. 
I was not confused. It was God
Come to straighten my thoughts.
Whole celestial vacuums
In the trunk of his pink Studebaker.
We would smoke and cough.
I sat very still, almost at peace with myself. 
He had shot a deer in the mountains. He thought
Last year’s winterkill was worse than usual.
I told him I didn’t know about guns.
Something forming on his forehead—a gloriole
Of splattered sun over snow.
We drank our lemonade in silence. 
He asked if he could go. He joked
About his wife’s tuna casserole. As a gift
I signed for him my last paperback.
He left the book of matches. I’ll not enroll
In the correspondence course it offers
For commercial artists. What a relief 
That the barbers in the trees are Chinese.
Green fronds are dropping in twos and threes
Around the bungalow, lessons
In the etiquette of diseased parrots. Bill Cody
Said it first, “If there is no God, then I am
His prophet.” Stop it. Please stop it.

It takes a heap o’ livin’ in a house t’ make it home, A heap o’ sun an’ shadder, an’ ye sometimes have t’ roam Afore ye really ’preciate the things ye lef’ behind, An’ hunger fer ’em somehow, with ’em allus on yer mind. It don’t make any differunce how rich ye get t’ be, How much yer chairs an’ tables cost, how great yer luxury; It ain’t home t’ ye, though it be the palace of a king, Until somehow yer soul is sort o’ wrapped round everything.  Home ain’t a place that gold can buy or get up in a minute; Afore it’s home there’s got t’ be a heap o’ livin’ in it; Within the walls there’s got t’ be some babies born, and then Right there ye’ve got t’ bring ‘em up t’ women good, an’ men; And gradjerly, as time goes on, ye find ye wouldn’t part With anything they ever used—they’ve grown into yer heart: The old high chairs, the playthings, too, the little shoes they wore Ye hoard; an’ if ye could ye’d keep the thumbmarks on the door.  Ye’ve got t’ weep t’ make it home, ye’ve got t’ sit an’ sigh An’ watch beside a loved one’s bed, an’ know that Death is nigh; An’ in the stillness o’ the night t’ see Death’s angel come, An’ close the eyes o’ her that smiled, an’ leave her sweet voice dumb. Fer these are scenes that grip the heart, an’ when yer tears are dried, Ye find the home is dearer than it was, an’ sanctified; An’ tuggin’ at ye always are the pleasant memories O’ her that was an’ is no more—ye can’t escape from these.  Ye’ve got t’ sing an’ dance fer years, ye’ve got t’ romp an’ play, An’ learn t’ love the things ye have by usin’ ’em each day; Even the roses ’round the porch must blossom year by year Afore they ’come a part o’ ye, suggestin’ someone dear Who used t’ love ’em long ago, an’ trained ’em jes’ t’ run The way they do, so’s they would get the early mornin’ sun; Ye’ve got t’ love each brick an’ stone from cellar up t’ dome: It takes a heap o’ livin’ in a house t’ make it home.

Your parents had reached a long slow time,
as animals do, the great center of their lives,
when they gleam in their fells as though eternally,
unchanging. Or as a day can seem eternal
if you lie and watch the full clouds, conscious
of your own time: you soon must get up and leave.
So father, mother, the small shabby town,
its patch of earth going on as though forever: you
forgot them there, where they’d been since you started out
and where you could find them again—as anyone
forgets what he has to lean on
so deeply and heavily that it wounds his side
and the pain seems only himself. 
Ungrateful? So you accused yourself one day,
waking suddenly. And when you went at last
to look for them where they always are, they’d gone,
or were withered alive, their mouths opening and closing
without sound. The buildings had leaned still farther
toward the dusty weeds and crumbs of old machines
littered everywhere inexplicably. And now
who will explain them? Your grandfather’s day
is as absent from your thought as is your own
gestation. And check the records:
what is written down says nothing.
The volumes all avoid the one question you have.
They’re like the notebooks you kept in adolescence:
you turn the endless pages and you wonder,
what did I know or feel, how did I live then,
what was this violence and love, this utter newness,
invention that could sing water and light, raging
at the first touch of dying, never mentioning death?
You went back and the bones of your native town
were like that, records from which something had escaped:
a skeletal mill that roofed ghostly technologies
where men once worked, coughed, burnt, bled.
And that way they had permitted the long pageants
of the children. And their mothers—whose images,
vague, identical, stalk by in the nights,
each one sorrowing and serene, her starved, enamelled,
hard flesh torn, her dress the blue of late dusk,
the heaven behind her a work of flat blinding gold.

The mountains carry snow, the season fails.
Jackstraw clapboard shivers on its nails,
the freezing air blows maple leaves and dust,
a thousand nails bleed laceries of rust,
slates crack and slide away, the gutters sprout.
I wonder: do a dead man’s bones come out 
like these old lintels and wasp-riddled beams?
I ask in simple consequence of structure seen
in this old house, grown sturdy in its fall,
the brace and bone of it come clear of all
I took for substance, what I could not prove
from any measure of design or love. 
Or is it rather that he falls away
to no articulation but decay,
however brightly leap the brass-hinged bone,
beam and rafter, joist and cellar-stone?

If I were doing my Laundry I’d wash my dirty Iran
I’d throw in my United States, and pour on the Ivory Soap, scrub up Africa, put all the birds and elephants back in the jungle,
I’d wash the Amazon river and clean the oily Carib & Gulf of Mexico,   
Rub that smog off the North Pole, wipe up all the pipelines in Alaska,   
Rub a dub dub for Rocky Flats and Los Alamos, Flush that sparkly Cesium out of Love Canal
Rinse down the Acid Rain over the Parthenon & Sphinx, Drain Sludge out of the Mediterranean basin & make it azure again,
Put some blueing back into the sky over the Rhine, bleach the little Clouds so snow return white as snow,
Cleanse the Hudson Thames & Neckar, Drain the Suds out of Lake Erie   
Then I’d throw big Asia in one giant Load & wash out the blood & Agent Orange,
Dump the whole mess of Russia and China in the wringer, squeeze out the tattletail Gray of U.S. Central American police state,
& put the planet in the drier & let it sit 20 minutes or an Aeon till it came out clean.
 
Boulder, April 26, 1980

I 
The students, lost in raucousness,
caught as by the elder Breughel’s eye,
we sit in the college store
over sandwiches and coffee, wondering.
She answers eagerly: the place was fine;
sometimes the winds grew very cold,
the snows so deep and wide she lost
sight of people. Yes, she was well
satisfied with her work, expected—
while the quarry’s owner was away—
to do another year of it.  
             II 
She is hammering. I hear
the steady sound inside our dry,
noisy days. Sparks fly; the mind,
so taken, mighty for a moment,
becomes quarry and sculptor both,
something caught like love and war
in this golden mesh: and daring
caught that flings like sparks girls
and boys, flagrant cities prompt
to daring’s will, love and war
its burly seconds.  
             III 
I see again three kids we passed,
three kids lounging at the edge
of a forsaken quarry like something
they had built; in its sleepy pool
they found the whiteness of their bodies,
the excitement like parian marble.  
             IV 
Such the waters we find ourselves
in. We sit in the college store absorbed
in food and talk. Eagerness seizes us
like love that leaves its best sailors
in the mighty waves, love the word
for hook whose catching, and the struggle
there, is one great musical clash
of minds—each wave a passion and a mind—
a possessed, tumultuous monument
that would be free.  
             V 
                                           We strain forward
as to some fabulous story. Incandescence
springs from her, the hammer of remembrance
fresh, the young woman, bulky graceful body,
face shining, who sculptured all winter
alone near the source of her rock,
digging down into the difficult rock: 
the young woman who lost a day once,
talked to her cat, and when the mirror
of her art became too clear, when dreaming
seemed too big for night alone, took long
walks back to people, back to speech,
and time:
             the woman, who at last—
“I do not use live models”—sculptured fish—
“I remember long lonely holidays at shores
when the spray alone defined green shapes
approaching”—has just seen (her eyes
still gleam with the gleam of it,
blink like the making of many
a take) a great catch.  
             VI 
                                                   April, we say,
is the time for fish, for reaching
in its sea-like waftings one
of earth’s original conclusions
like the leftover gill slits
the singing student told us about
in this very spot just two days ago . . . 
we are in the middle of a great catch,
there collected as from her year-long
lonely rock, the thrashing, clean-
scaled, clear-lit shad in the net.

They are a gift I have wanted again.
Wanted: One moment in mountains
when winter got so cold
the oil froze before it could burn.
I chopped ferns of hoarfrost from all the windows
and peered up at pines, a wedding cake
by a baker gone mad. Swirls by the thousand
shimmered above me until a cloud
lumbered over a ridge,
bringing the heavier white of more flurries. 
I believed, I believed, I believed
it would last, that when you went out
to test the black ice or to dig out a Volkswagon
filled with rich women, you’d return
and we’d sputter like oil,
match after match, warm in the making.
Wisconsin’s flat farmland never approved:
I hid in cornfields far into October,
listening to music that whirled from my thumbprint.
When sunset played havoc with bright leaves of alders, 
I never mentioned longing or fear.
I crouched like a good refugee in brown creeks
and forgot why Autumn is harder than Spring.
But snug on the western slope of that mountain
I’d accept every terror, break open seals
to release love’s headwaters to unhurried sunlight.
Weren’t we Big Hearts? Through some trick of silver
we held one another, believing each motion the real one,
ah, lover, why were dark sources bundled up
in our eyes? Each owned an agate, 
marbled with anguish, a heart or its echo,
we hardly knew. Lips touching lips,
did that break my horizon
as much as those horses broke my belief?
You drove off and I walked the old road,
scolding the doubles that wanted so much.
The chestnut mare whinnied a cloud into scrub pine.
In a windless corner of a corral,
four horses fit like puzzle pieces.
Their dark eyes and lashes defined by the white. 
The colt kicked his hind, loped from the fence.
The mares and a stallion galloped behind,
lifting and leaping, finding each other
in full accord with the earth and their bodies.
No harm ever touched them once they cut loose,
snorting at flurries falling again.
How little our chances for feeling ourselves.
They vanished so quickly—one flick of a tail.
Where do their mountains and moments begin?
I stood a long time in sharpening wind.

From the tower window
the moon
draws a silver maple’s shadow
across a spangled lawn;
                                  horses
rear, manes lashing the air,
front legs floating.
                              Half monarch,
half shadow, the tree
aspires to the sky;
one branch, cracked by lightning,
scrapes the earth.
                           Reflected
on the grass, bent twigs
are curved hooves, galloping
as the moon rises. 
Divided it stands
in wholeness, mourning
its victories, praising
the god of trees, the king of horses. 
The tree holds souls
in a bark prison
poised like a runner at the starting line—
and bolts free, wildly
pawing the ground those roots lie under.

I have just come down from my father.
Higher and higher he lies
Above me in a blue light
Shed by a tinted window.
I drop through six white floors
And then step out onto pavement. 
Still feeling my father ascend,
I start to cross the firm street,
My shoulder blades shining with all
The glass the huge building can raise.
Now I must turn round and face it,
And know his one pane from the others. 
Each window possesses the sun
As though it burned there on a wick.
I wave, like a man catching fire.
All the deep-dyed windowpanes flash,
And, behind them, all the white rooms
They turn to the color of Heaven. 
Ceremoniously, gravely, and weakly,
Dozens of pale hands are waving
Back, from inside their flames.
Yet one pure pane among these
Is the bright, erased blankness of nothing.
I know that my father is there, 
In the shape of his death still living.
The traffic increases around me
Like a madness called down on my head.
The horns blast at me like shotguns,
And drivers lean out, driven crazy—
But now my propped-up father 
Lifts his arm out of stillness at last.
The light from the window strikes me
And I turn as blue as a soul,
As the moment when I was born.
I am not afraid for my father—
Look! He is grinning; he is not 
Afraid for my life, either,
As the wild engines stand at my knees
Shredding their gears and roaring,
And I hold each car in its place
For miles, inciting its horn
To blow down the walls of the world 
That the dying may float without fear
In the bold blue gaze of my father.
Slowly I move to the sidewalk
With my pin-tingling hand half dead
At the end of my bloodless arm.
I carry it off in amazement, 
High, still higher, still waving,
My recognized face fully mortal,
Yet not; not at all, in the pale,
Drained, otherworldly, stricken,
Created hue of stained glass.
I have just come down from my father.

Temples look like discarded alphabets.   
We loved lying in their shadows lazily   
deciphering and resting and laying bets 
on what they really were for. Easily   
caught by fantasy, we no longer cared
why they were there, just that they were. Happy 
to sit down and drink the water we shared   
(having lugged our plastic bottle, and hats,   
and camera, through the human dung bared 
right there in the sun—where else could you get   
relief with no toilets?) we guzzled it down
and splashed it on our arms, hands, legs, and necks. 
A girl in dirty, expensive clothes found   
us with the bottle and asked us for some.
I said no. As she left, a gagging smell wound 
its way out from the bottle’s damp lung.
I’ve often been asked to give what I’ve saved,   
but under the temple I said no, numbed 
against the girl, like one of those bridesmaids   
who kept her oil in the Bible story
and was safe for the night. I’d hated those maids 
until I became one in my story,
the shape of the character I’d searched for   
surprising me as the temples did: See 
how golden but pocked they’ve become, nor   
are they quite decipherable anymore,   
at least to those who forget what they’re for, 
which is worship, the greed of prayer.
“So that’s who you are,” my friend said. “Thirsty?”   
With him I drank, not quite the maid in the story, 
but in her shadow, like letters at rest   
in new words on a palimpsest.

Hot sun, cool fire, tempered with sweet air, Black shade, fair nurse, shadow my white hair. Shine, sun; burn, fire; breathe, air, and ease me; Black shade, fair nurse, shroud me and please me. Shadow, my sweet nurse, keep me from burning; Make not my glad cause cause of mourning.     Let not my beauty’s fire     Inflame unstaid desire,     Nor pierce any bright eye     That wandereth lightly.

for John



I couldn’t see in this light
even if I wished. The black
grillwork over black, cool upon coal,
kisses me back in an icy press.
Not wanting—anything—but to fall
as the empty trash cans mingle
below with the smell of feral cats. 
Flailing moon the color of suds
over this factory of artifice,
moored in the poverty of my untouched
element, downed like a dog
struck by a diesel—one headlamp
flaring before my shadow’s dust
buries its past in a crescent of mirth. 
Lost now in this anonymity of barely
knowing you, my body would go
unsearched for in the rubble. Who could
remember my odor, my perfect strangeness
at a glance? Life leaves through the gate
of an ache, where you are, a vanishing
landscape. Do I dare it back? 
I don’t know where you go
anymore when you escape
into that vast wilderness
of our legal separation. Your
memory rises from the knocking
pipes, a sudden heat, a blast
of blood. Where does it go? 
The galloping horses I hear are not
hooves but my heart kicking in its swollen
stall. But you, you take things as
a letting go, like a beacon that opens
a lens cap to our past. You take off
the dark like this snow-strewn alley,
a radiance, but no light of mine. 
Jealous as an abandoned child, I
had no word for father. It floated
in heaven like friend or famine.
It rose like a muscle and punctuated
my dreams, the ones of ruined houses,
of countries like this one where the faces
of whores and the working poor are my own. 
You had Irish eyes the color of old
ice. What you lost was first love
and a word for forever, like evergreen, oceanic, fossil. My bones could grind
themselves to salt and I would still be
this aging woman, this battered lifeline.
History never has been kind to a loser. 
What do I see when morning
chops ice into jade? What ring
could I trade now for the freedom
to bleed? What would I remember
of a hearth where the flags
of my silks beat at half mast, where
I studied a sure vocabulary of snow? 
I had to leave before I could
hear it: the sound of dishwater
in a steamed house, the singing
of water on white porcelain, cooling
like clots seeping through a wound,
our collision of tensions, a viscous
rendered fat, divorced, releasing.

    Just joined James.
    In no way a disappointment.

    Leave a nature to rain.
    It makes no difference if they use it.
    A narrative oh how often have I thought that a narrative.   
    How often will a narrative do.
    Complain about fifty narratives perfectly.
    He is waiting not for his food but for his appointment. Dear dear.
    Plenty of bread and butter.
    He is waiting not for his food.
    Resignation does not mean narrative.
    He is to come welcome, as well as having left welcome is not a narrative but foolishly.
    I was completely persuaded by Mrs. Tolstoy but she told me.   
    She was completely persuaded by William but she told me.   
    How should either have been headed very often.
    That is astonishing a narrative and I would so much rather be poetical.
    For me.

What of her glass without her? The blank gray    There where the pool is blind of the moon’s face.    Her dress without her? The tossed empty space Of cloud-rack whence the moon has passed away. Her paths without her? Day’s appointed sway    Usurped by desolate night. Her pillowed place    Without her? Tears, ah me! for love’s good grace, And cold forgetfulness of night or day.  What of the heart without her? Nay, poor heart,    Of thee what word remains ere speech be still?    A wayfarer by barren ways and chill, Steep ways and weary, without her thou art, Where the long cloud, the long wood’s counterpart,    Sheds doubled darkness up the labouring hill.

If you have a house
you must think about it all the time   
as you reside in the house so
it must be a home in your mind 
you must ask yourself (wherever you are)   
have I closed the front door 
and the back door is often forgotten   
not against thieves necessarily 
but the wind   oh   if it blows   
either door open   then the heat 
the heat you’ve carefully nurtured   
with layers of dry hardwood 
and a couple of opposing green   
brought in to slow the fire 
as well as the little pilot light   
in the convenient gas backup 
all of that care will be mocked because   
you have not kept the house on your mind 
but these may actually be among   
the smallest concerns   for instance 
the house could be settling   you may   
notice the thin slanting line of light 
above the doors   you have to think about that   
luckily you have been paying attention 
the house’s dryness can be humidified   
with vaporizers in each room and pots 
of water on the woodstove   should you leave   
for the movies after dinner   ask yourself 
have I turned down the thermometer
and moved all wood paper away from the stove 
the fiery result of excited distraction   
could be too horrible to describe 
now we should talk especially to Northerners   
of the freezing of the pipe   this can often 
be prevented by pumping water continuously   
through the baseboard heating system 
allowing the faucet to drip drip continuously   
day and night   you must think about the drains 
separately   in fact you should have established   
their essential contribution to the ordinary 
kitchen and toilet life of the house   
digging these drains deep into warm earth 
if it hasn’t snowed by mid-December you   
must cover them with hay   sometimes rugs 
and blankets have been used   do not be   
troubled by their monetary value 
as this is a regionally appreciated emergency   
you may tell your friends to consider 
your house as their own   that is   
if they do not wear outdoor shoes 
when thumping across the gleam of their poly-
urethaned floors they must bring socks or slippers 
to your house as well   you must think   
of your house when you’re in it and 
when you’re visiting the superior cabinets   
and closets of others   when you approach 
your house in the late afternoon
in any weather   green or white   you will catch 
sight first of its new aluminum snow-resistant   
roof and the reflections in the cracked windows 
its need in the last twenty-five years for paint   
which has created a lovely design 
in russet pink and brown   the colors of un-
intentioned neglect   you must admire the way it does not 
(because of someone’s excellent decision
sixty years ago) stand on the high ridge deforming 
the green profile of the hill but rests in the modesty   
of late middle age under the brow of the hill with 
its back to the dark hemlock forest looking steadily
out for miles toward the cloud refiguring meadows and 
mountains of the next state   coming up the road
by foot or auto the house can be addressed personally 
House!   in the excitement of work and travel to
other people’s houses with their interesting improvements 
we thought of you often and spoke of your coziness
in winter   your courage in wind and fire   your small 
airy rooms in humid summer   how you nestle in spring
into the leaves and flowers of the hawthorn and the sage green 
leaves of the Russian olive tree   House!   you were not forgotten

The house was just twinkling in the moon light,

A personal lens: glass bending rays
That gave one that day’s news
Saying each and every day, 
Just remember you are standing
On a planet that’s evolving.
How beautiful, she thought, what distance does 
For water, the view from above or afar.
In last night’s dream, they were back again
At the beginning. She was a child 
And he was a child.
A plane lit down and left her there.
Cold whitening the white sky whiter. 
Then a scalpel cut her open for all the world
To be a sea.

In Indianapolis they drive
five hundred miles and end up
where they started: survival
of the fittest. In the swamps
of Auburn and Elkhart,
in the jungles of South Bend,
one-cylinder chain-driven runabouts fall
to air-cooled V-4’s, a-speed gearboxes,
16-horse flat-twin midships engines—
carcasses left behind
by monobloc motors, electric starters,
3-speed gears, six cylinders, 2-chain drive,
overhead cams, supercharged
to 88 miles an hour in second gear, the age
of Leviathan ...     There is grandeur in this view of life,
    as endless forms
    most beautiful and wonderful

It was like soul-kissing, the way the words
filled my mouth as Mrs. Purdy read from her desk.
All the other kids zoned an hour ahead to 3:15,
but Mrs. Purdy and I wandered lonely as clouds borne
by a breeze off Mount Parnassus. She must have seen
the darkest eyes in the room brim: The next day
she gave me a poem she’d chosen especially for me
to read to the all except for me white class.
She smiled when she told me to read it, smiled harder,
said oh yes I could. She smiled harder and harder
until I stood and opened my mouth to banjo playing
darkies, pickaninnies, disses and dats. When I finished
my classmates stared at the floor. We walked silent
to the buses, awed by the power of words.

There was the day we swam in a river, a lake, and an ocean.   
And the day I quit the job my father got me.   
And the day I stood outside a door,   
and listened to my girlfriend making love   
to someone obviously not me, inside,    
and I felt strange because I didn’t care.    
There was the morning I was born,   
and the year I was a loser,   
and the night I was the winner of the prize   
for which the audience applauded.    
Then there was someone else I met,   
whose face and voice I can’t forget,   
and the memory of her   
is like a jail I’m trapped inside,    
or maybe she is something I just use   
                                       to hold my real life at a distance.  Happiness, Joe says, is a wild red flower   
                      plucked from a river of lava   
and held aloft on a tightrope   
                      strung between two scrawny trees   
above a canyon   
                      in a manic-depressive windstorm.

         PRECEPT I.  In Things of moment, on thy self depend, Nor trust too far thy Servant or thy Friend: With private Views, thy Friend may promise fair, And Servants very seldom prove sincere.         PRECEPT II.  What can be done, with Care perform to Day, Dangers unthought-of will attend Delay; Your distant Prospects all precarious are, And Fortune is as fickle as she’s fair.         PRECEPT III.  Nor trivial Loss, nor trivial Gain despise; Molehills, if often heap’d, to Mountains rise: Weigh every small Expence, and nothing waste, Farthings long sav’d, amount to Pounds at last.

—for perfidious protectors



I was playing in the street
no one paid attention to me
as I made forms out of sand
mumbling Rimbaud under my breath 
once an elderly gentleman overheard it
—little boy you are a poet
just now we are organizing
a grass-roots literary movement 
he stroked my dirty head
gave me a large lollypop
and even bought clothes
in the protective coloring of youth 
I didn’t have such a splendid suit
since first communion
short trousers and a wide
sailor’s collar 
black patent leather shoes with a buckle
white knee-high socks
the elderly gentleman took me by the hand
and led the way to the ball 
other boys were there
also in short trousers
carefully shaven
shuffling their feet 
—well boys now it’s time to play
why are you standing in the corners
asked the elderly gentleman
—make a circle holding hands 
but we didn’t want tag
or blindman’s buff
we had enough of the elderly gentleman
we were very hungry 
so we were seated promptly
around a large table
given lemonade
and pieces of cake 
now disguised as adults
with deep voices
the boys got up they praised us
or slapped us on our hands 
we didn’t hear anything
didn’t feel anything
staring with great eyes
at the piece of cake
that kept melting
in our hot hands
and this sweet taste the first in our lives
disappeared inside our dark sleeves

For Carl Solomon



I 
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,
who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,
who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,
who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,
who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,
who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,
who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,
who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night
with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,
incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,
Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,
who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,
who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford’s floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi’s, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,
who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,
a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon,
yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,
whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,
who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,
suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of China under junk-withdrawal in Newark’s bleak furnished room,   
who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,
who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,
who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas,

ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you’re really in the total animal soup of time—
and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipsis catalogue a variable measure and the vibrating plane,

On an island the soft hue of memory,
moss green, kerosene yellow, drifting, mingling
in the Caribbean Sea,
a six-year-old named Alfred
learns all the words to all the songs
on his grandparents’ jukebox, and sings them.
To learn the words is not so hard.
Many barmaids and teenagers have done as well.
But to sing as Alfred sings—
how can a giant whale live in the small pool of his chest?
How can there be breakers this high, notes crashing
at the beach of the throat,
and a reef of coral so enormous only the fishes know its size? 
The grandparents watch. They can’t sing.
They don’t know who this voice is, trapped in their grandson’s body.
The boy whose parents sent him back to the island
to chatter mango-talk and scrap with chickens—
three years ago he didn’t know the word “sad”!
Now he strings a hundred passionate sentences on a single line.
He bangs his fist so they will raise the volume. 
What will they do together in their old age?
It is hard enough keeping yourself alive.
And this wild boy, loving nothing but music—
he’ll sing all night, hugging the jukebox.
When a record pauses, that live second before dropping down,
Alfred hugs tighter, arms stretched wide,
head pressed on the luminous belly. “Now!” he yells.
A half-smile when the needle breathes again. 
They’ve tried putting him to bed, but he sings in bed.
Even in Spanish—and he doesn’t speak Spanish!
Sings and screams, wants to go back to the jukebox. O mama I was born with a trumpet in my throat
      spent all these years tryin’ to cough it up …

^^EOP^^

Sometimes I long to be the woodpile,
cut-apart trees soon to be smoke,
or even the smoke itself, 
sinewy ghost of ash and air, going
wherever I want to, at least for a while. 
Neither inside nor out,
neither lost nor home, no longer
a shape or a name, I’d pass through 
all the broken windows of the world.
It’s not a wish for consciousness to end. 
It’s not the appetite an army has
for its own emptying heart,
but a hunger to stand now and then 
alone on the death-grounds,
where the dogs of the self are feeding.


^^EOP^^

Now they to their slogged forthwendings tend,
four hunters, guns askew like four unruly hairs,
to start the rabbit or pheasant from hiding.
But these cocks, wily, lie close and spy from
covert or culvert the passing grim party
and the rabbit keeps Viet-Cong-like to its digs.
Here is no hunting horn and gargle of hounds
among horse whinny and hoof stamp and ladies
in smart hunting habits, though these four
sport red in patterns motley or checkered and
in hues fluorescent as road crewmen’s vests.
Small wonder the game is not game,
so uncouthly strikes the eye this drawling
troupe of unshaven hope and choler and color. 
The roadside sparrows, come to dust, scatter
before the headlong hum of him leather-crouched,
helmet-missled over the speed-stretched oval
wheels of his hundred-mile-per-hour crotch rocket
all the way to Lone Tree past the six-foot
Iowa corn, surprised cows and hogs and the high
horse considering gravely over the fence this
black burst of boots and gloves and goggles.
So the goggle-eyed frog dives under a
scum of ditch-vetched water fern and the
blue-backed kestrel stoops from its crystal
insulator perch and, gray as a piece of the
paving, up springs the four-inch grasshopper
splat! like a nicotine bullet in the teeth. 
Bearded buggy dads on their way to market,
fine trotters high-stepping between shafts,
broad-brim-hatted, blue-chambray-shirted,
with black pants and black suspenders, sons
like scrubbed minor replicas, dutiful
daughters, eyes downcast among chatter
of bonneted grannies and mothers, patriarchal
grandfathers observing that rain must come
as it always has, God’s will be done, and   
brief gossip also among the elders of shunning
a deacon caught in unnatural circumstances
with a pig—the Devil’s own vessel!—and of
Sister Sara, who’s soon to require the midwife,
as the moon too is full almost.

for my son



The way a tired Chippewa woman
Who’s lost a child gathers up black feathers,
Black quills & leaves
That she wraps & swaddles in a little bale, a shag
Cocoon she carries with her & speaks to always
As if it were the child,
Until she knows the soul has grown fat & clever,
That the child can find its own way at last;
Well, I go everywhere
Picking the dust out of the dust, scraping the breezes
Up off the floor, & gather them into a doll
Of you, to touch at the nape of the neck, to slip
Under my shirt like a rag—the way
Another man’s wallet rides above his heart. As you
Cry out, as if calling to a father you conjure
In the paling light, the voice rises, instead, in me.
Nothing stops it, the crying. Not the clove of moon,
Not the woman raking my back with her words. Our letters
Close. Sometimes, you ask
About the world; sometimes, I answer back. Nights
Return you to me for a while, as sleep returns sleep
To a landscape ravaged
& familiar. The dark watermark of your absence, a hush.


^^EOP^^

You can tell by how he lists 
                           to let herkiss him, that the getting, as he gets it,is good. 
        It’s good in the sweetly salty,deeply thirsty way that a sea-foggedrain is good after a summer-long boutof inland drought. 
                  And you know itwhen you see it, don’t you? How itdrenches what’s dry, how the having of it quenches. 
               There is a grassy inlet where your ocean meets your land, a slipthat needs a certain kind of vessel,
                                   andwhen that shapely skiff skims in at last,trimmed bright, mast lightly flagging left and right, 
              then the long, lush reeds of your longing part, and soft against the hull of that bent wood almost im-perceptibly brushes a luscious hush the heart heeds helplessly—
                           the hush of the very good.

for Dave Smith



Our clothes are still wet from wading
The Chickamunga last evening.
There is heavy frost. We have
Walked on the dead all night.
Now in the firelight
We are exchanging shells and grapeshot. 
I can still hear our loud huzzah
When late in the day
The enemy fell into full retreat
Along the pine ridge to the east. . . 
We chased them until we were weary.
Each night this week
There’s been something
To keep me from sleep. Just an hour ago
I saw 
A dead sharpshooter sitting
Against a rock with a scallop
Of biscuit still lodged in his mouth.
He wore one silk sock. 
Snedikerhas returned from Chattanooga
With five thousand convalescents
For the left wing of their musketry. 
We have roasted a deer
With a molasses sauce and pepper.
Magrill and zandt have returned
From horse hunting with a sack of sugar. 
By morning we will have buried our dead
And fed the prisoners: Joe Cotton 
Will hang all seven of them in one tree
When he sees they’re done
Licking their fingers. . . 
I shot a Rebel yesterday
In high water just for cursing me.
Just six months ago
For that alone it would have meant
Three days in stockade. 
We can see now that cannonading
Has set the hillside on fire.
The wounded Grays
Will be burned
Beyond their Christian names. . . 
Joe Cotton says he’d ask God
For rain, but he’s got no tent
And river water
Has chilled him straight through 
To the very quick of his being.

Is that an attitude for a flower, to stand
like a club at the walk; poor slain boy,
is that a way to show
gratitude to the gods? White
with colored hearts, the tall flowers
sway around you, all the other boys,
in the cold spring, as the violets open. 
         2
There were no flowers in antiquity
but boys’ bodies, pale, perfectly imagined.
So the gods sank to human shape with longing.
In the field, in the willow grove,
Apollo sent the courtiers away. 
         3
And from the blood of the wound
a flower sprang, lilylike, more brilliant
than the purples of Tyre.
Then the god wept: his vital grief
flooded the earth. 
         4
Beauty dies: that is the source
of creation. Outside the ring of trees
the courtiers could hear
the dove’s call transmit
its uniform, its inborn sorrow—
They stood listening, among the rustling willows.
Was this the god’s lament?
They listened carefully. And for a short time
all sound was sad. 
         5
There is no other immortality:
in the cold spring, the purple violets open.
And yet, the heart is black,
there is its violence frankly exposed.
Or is it not the heart at the center
but some other word?
And now someone is bending over them,
meaning to gather them— 
         6
They could not wait
in exile forever.
Through the glittering grove
the courtiers ran
calling the name
of their companion
over the birds’ noise,
over the willows’ aimless sadness.
Well into the night they wept,
their clear tears
altering no earthly color.


^^EOP^^

You dweller in the dark cabin,
To whom the watermelon is always purple,   
Whose garden is wind and moon, 
Of the two dreams, night and day,
What lover, what dreamer, would choose   
The one obscured by sleep? 
Here is the plantain by your door   
And the best cock of red feather   
That crew before the clocks. 
A feme may come, leaf-green,   
Whose coming may give revel   
Beyond revelries of sleep, 
Yes, and the blackbird spread its tail,   
So that the sun may speckle,   
While it creaks hail. 
You dweller in the dark cabin,   
Rise, since rising will not waken,   
And hail, cry hail, cry hail.

Thou hidden love of God, whose height,       Whose depth unfathom’d no man knows, I see from far thy beauteous light,       Inly I sigh for thy repose; My heart is pain’d, nor can it be At rest, till it finds rest in thee.  Thy secret voice invites me still,       The sweetness of thy yoke to prove: And fain I would: but tho’ my will       Seem fix’d, yet wide my passions rove; Yet hindrances strew all the way; I aim at thee, yet from thee stray.  ’Tis mercy all, that thou hast brought       My mind to seek her peace in thee; Yet while I seek, but find thee not,       No peace my wand’ring soul shall see; O when shall all my wand’rings end, And all my steps to thee-ward tend!  Is there a thing beneath the sun       That strives with thee my heart to share? Ah! tear it thence, and reign alone,       The Lord of ev’ry motion there; Then shall my heart from earth be free, When it hath found repose in thee.  O hide this self from me, that I       No more, but Christ in me may live; My vile affections crucify,       Nor let one darling lust survive; In all things nothing may I see, Nothing desire or seek but thee.  O Love, thy sov’reign aid impart,       To save me from low-thoughted care: Chase this self-will thro’ all my heart,       Thro’ all its latent mazes there: Make me thy duteous child, that I Ceaseless may Abba, Father, cry!  Ah no! ne’er will I backward turn:       Thine wholly, thine alone I am! Thrice happy he who views with scorn       Earth’s toys, for thee his constant flame; O help that I may never move From the blest footsteps of thy love!  Each moment draw from earth away       My heart that lowly waits thy call: Speak to my inmost soul, and say,       I am thy love, thy God, thy all! To feel thy power, to hear thy voice, To taste thy love, be all my choice.


^^EOP^^

The wind rests its cheek upon the ground and feels the cool damp   
And lifts its head with twigs and small dead blades of grass   
Pressed into it as you might at the beach rise up and brush away   
The sand. The day is cool and says, “I’m just staying overnight.”   
The world is filled with music, and in between the music, silence   
And varying the silence all sorts of sounds, natural and man made:   
There goes a plane, some cars, geese that honk and, not here, but   
Not so far away, a scream so rending that to hear it is to be
Never again the same. “Why, this is hell.” Out of the death breeding   
Soil, here, rise emblems of innocence, snowdrops that struggle   
Easily into life and hang their white enamel heads toward the dirt   
And in the yellow grass are small wild crocuses from hills goats   
Have cropped to barrenness. The corms come by mail, are planted.   
Then do their thing: to live! To live! So natural and so hard   
Hard as it seems it must be for green spears to pierce the all but   
Frozen mold and insist that they too, like mouse-eared chickweed,
Will live. The spears lengthen, the bud appears and spreads, its   
Seed capsule fattens and falls, the green turns yellowish and withers   
Stretched upon the ground. In Washington, magnolias were in bud. In   
Charlottesville early bulbs were up, brightening the muck. Tomorrow   
Will begin another spring. No one gets many, one at a time, like a long   
Awaited letter that one day comes. But it may not say what you hoped   
Or distraction robs it of what it once would have meant. Spring comes   
And the winter weather, here, may hold. It is arbitrary, like the plan   
Of Washington, D.C. Avenues and circles in asphalt web and no   
One gets younger: which is not, for the young, true, discovering new   
Freedoms at twenty, a relief not to be a teen-ager anymore. One of us   
Had piles, another water on the knee, a third a hernia—a strangulated   
Hernia is one of life’s less pleasant bits of news—and only   
One, at twenty, moved easily through all the galleries to pill   
Free sleep. Oh, it’s not all that bad. The sun shines on my hand   
And the myriad lines that criss-cross tell the story of nearly fifty
Years. Sorry, it’s too long to relate. Once, when I was young, I   
Awoke at first light and sitting in a rocking chair watched the sun   
Come up beyond the houses across the street. Another time I stood   
At the cables of a liner and watched the wake turning and   
Turning upon itself. Another time I woke up and in a bottle   
On a chest of drawers the thoughtful doctor had left my tonsils. I   
Didn’t keep them. The turning of the globe is not so real to us   
As the seasons turning and the days that rise out of early gray   
—The world is all cut-outs then—and slip or step steadily down   
The slopes of our lives where the emotions and needs sprout. “I   
Need you,” tree, that dominates this yard, thick-waisted, tall   
And crook branched. Its bark scales off like that which we forget:   
Pain, an introduction at a party, what precisely happened umpteen   
Years or days or hours ago. And that same blue jay returns, or perhaps   
It is another. All jays are one to me. But not the sun which seems at   
Each rising new, as though in the night it enacted death and rebirth,   
As flowers seem to. The roses this June will be different roses   
Even though you cut an armful and come in saying, “Here are the roses,”   
As though the same blooms had come back, white freaked with red   
And heavily scented. Or a cut branch of pear blooms before its time,   
“Forced.” Time brings us into bloom and we wait, busy, but wait   
For the unforced flow of words and intercourse and sleep and dreams   
In which the past seems to portend a future which is just more   
Daily life. The cat has a ripped ear. He fights, he fights all   
The tom cats all the time. There are blood gouts on a velvet seat.   
Easily sponged off: but these red drops on a book of Stifter’s, will   
I remember and say at some future time, “Oh, yes, that was the day   
Hodge had a torn ear and bled on the card table?” Poor
Hodge, battered like an old car. Silence flows into my mind. It   
Is spring. It is also still really winter. Not a day when you say,   
“What a beautiful spring day.” A day like twilight or evening when   
You think, “I meant to watch the sun set.” And then comes on
To rain. “You’ve got to take,” says the man at the store, “the rough   
With the smooth.” A window to the south is rough with raindrops   
That, caught in the screen, spell out untranslatable glyphs. A story   
Not told: so much not understood, a sight, an insight, and you pass on,   
Another day for each day is subjective and there is a totality of days   
As there are as many to live it. The day lives us and in exchange   
We it: after snowball time, a month, March, of fits and starts, winds,   
Rain, spring hints and wintry arrears. The weather pays its check,   
Like quarreling in a D.C. hotel, “I won’t quarrel about it, but I made
No local calls.” Strange city, broad and desolating, monuments   
Rearing up and offices like monuments and crowds lined up to see
The White House inside. “We went to see the White House.   It was lovely.”
Not so strange though as the cemetery with guttering flame and   
Admirals and generals with bigger gravestones than the lesser fry   
Below Lee’s house, false marble pillars and inside all so
Everyday, in every room a shawl tossed untidily upon a chair or bed   
Created no illusion of lived-in-ness. But the periwinkles do, in beds   
That flatten and are starred blue-violet, a retiring flower loved,   
It would seem, of the dead, so often found where they congregate. A   
Quote from Aeschylus: I forget. All, all is forgotten gradually and
One wonders if these ideas that seem handed down are truly what they were?
An idea may mutate like a plant, and what was once held basic truth   
Become an idle thought. like, “Shall we plant some periwinkles there
By that bush? They’re so to be depended on.” The wind shakes the screen
And all the raindrops on it streak and run in stems. It’s colder.
The crocuses close up. The snowdrops are brushed with mud. The sky   
Colors itself rosily behind gray-black and the rain falls through   
The basketball hoop on a garage, streaking its backboard with further   
Trails of rust, a lovely color to set with periwinkle violet-blue.   
And the trees shiver and shudder in the light rain blasts from off   
The ocean. The street wet reflects the breakup of the clouds   
On its face, driving over sky with a hissing sound. The car   
Slides slightly and in the west appear streaks of different green:   
A lid lifted briefly on the spring. Then the moon burns through   
Racing clouds, its aureole that of rings of oil on water in a harbor   
Bubbling up from an exhaust. Clear the sky. Beside a rim of moon.   
Three stars and only three and one planet. So under lilacs unleaved   
Lie a clump of snowdrops and one purple crocus. Purple. A polka-dotted   
Color little girls are fond of: “See my new dess!” and she twirls   
On one foot. Then, crossed, bursts into tears. Smiles and rain, like   
These passing days in which buds swell, unseen as yet, waiting   
For the elms to color their further out most twigs, only the willow   
Gleams yellow. Life is hard. Some are strong, some weak, most   
Untested. These useless truths blow about the yard the day after   
Rain the soft sunlight making softer shadows on the faded lawn.   
The world looks so old in the spring, laid out under the sky. One   
Gull coasts by, unexpected as a kiss on the nape of the neck. These
Days need birds and so they come, a flock of ducks, and a bunch of   
Small fluffy unnamed balls that hide in hedges and make a racket.   
“The gift of life,” as though, existing in expectancy and then   
Someone came up and said, “Here,” or, “Happy Birthday.” It is more   
Mysterious than that, pierced by blue or running in the rain
Or simply lying down to read. Writing a postponed letter which may   
Bring no pleasure: arduous truths to tell. And if you thought March was bad
Consider April, early April, wet snow falling into blue squills   
That underneath a beech make an illusory lake, a haze of blue   
With depth to it. That is like pain, ordinary household pain,
Like piles, or bumping against a hernia. All the signs are set for A OK
A day to visit the National Gallery—Velázquez, Degas—but, and   
What a but, with water on the knee “You’ll need a wheelchair, Mummy.”
Coasting among the masterpieces, of what use are they? Angel with a   
Hurdy-Gurdy

Love, thou are absolute sole lordOf life and death. To prove the word,We’ll now appeal to none of allThose thy old soldiers, great and tall,Ripe men of martyrdom, that could reach downWith strong arms their triumphant crown;Such as could with lusty breathSpeak loud into the face of deathTheir great Lord’s glorious name; to noneOf those whose spacious bosoms spread a throneFor love at large to fill; spare blood and sweat,And see him take a private seat,Making his mansion in the mildAnd milky soul of a soft child.
     Scarce has she learn’d to lisp the nameOf martyr, yet she thinks it shameLife should so long play with that breathWhich spent can buy so brave a death.She never undertook to knowWhat death with love should have to do;Nor has she e’er yet understoodWhy to show love she should shed blood;Yet though she cannot tell you why,She can love, and she can die.
     Scarce has she blood enough to makeA guilty sword blush for her sake;Yet has she’a heart dares hope to proveHow much less strong is death than love.
     Be love but there, let poor six yearsBe pos’d with the maturest fearsMan trembles at, you straight shall findLove knows no nonage, nor the mind.’Tis love, not years or limbs that canMake the martyr, or the man.
     Love touch’d her heart, and lo it beatsHigh, and burns with such brave heats,Such thirsts to die, as dares drink upA thousand cold deaths in one cup.Good reason, for she breathes all fire;Her weak breast heaves with strong desireOf what she may with fruitless wishesSeek for amongst her mother’s kisses.
     Since ’tis not to be had at home,She’ll travel to a martyrdom.No home for hers confesses sheBut where she may a martyr be.
      She’ll to the Moors, and trade with themFor this unvalued diadem.She’ll offer them her dearest breath,With Christ’s name in ’t, in change for death.She’ll bargain with them, and will giveThem God; teach them how to liveIn him; or, if they this deny,For him she’ll teach them how to die.So shall she leave amongst them sownHer Lord’s blood, or at least her own.
     Farewell then, all the world, adieu!Teresa is no more for you.Farewell, all pleasures, sports, and joys,(Never till now esteemed toys)Farewell, whatever dear may be,Mother’s arms or father’s knee,Farewell house and farewell home,She’s for the Moors, and martyrdom!
     Sweet, not so fast! lo, thy fair spouse,Whom thou seek’st with so swift vows,Calls thee back, and bids thee comeT’ embrace a milder martyrdom.
     Blest powers forbid thy tender lifeShould bleed upon a barbarous knife;Or some base hand have power to raseThy breast’s chaste cabinet, and uncaseA soul kept there so sweet; oh no,Wise Heav’n will never have it so;Thou art Love’s victim, and must dieA death more mystical and high;Into Love’s arms thou shalt let fallA still-surviving funeral.He is the dart must make the deathWhose stroke shall taste thy hallow’d breath;A dart thrice dipp’d in that rich flameWhich writes thy spouse’s radiant nameUpon the roof of heav’n, where ayeIt shines, and with a sovereign rayBeats bright upon the burning facesOf souls, which in that name’s sweet gracesFind everlasting smiles. So rare,So spiritual, pure, and fairMust be th’ immortal instrumentUpon whose choice point shall be sentA life so lov’d; and that there beFit executioners for thee,The fair’st and first-born sons of fire,Blest Seraphim, shall leave their quireAnd turn Love’s soldiers, upon theeTo exercise their archery.
     Oh, how oft shalt thou complainOf a sweet and subtle pain,Of intolerable joys,Of a death in which who diesLoves his death, and dies again,And would forever so be slain,And lives and dies, and knows not whyTo live, but that he thus may never leave to die.
     How kindly will thy gentle heartKiss the sweetly-killing dart!And close in his embraces keepThose delicious wounds, that weepBalsam to heal themselves with. ThusWhen these thy deaths, so numerous,Shall all at last die into one,And melt thy soul’s sweet mansionLike a soft lump of incense, hastedBy too hot a fire, and wastedInto perfuming clouds, so fastShalt thou exhale to Heav’n at lastIn a resolving sigh; and then,O what? Ask not the tongues of men;Angels cannot tell; suffice,Thyself shall feel thine own full joysAnd hold them fast forever. ThereSo soon as thou shalt first appear,The moon of maiden stars, thy whiteMistress, attended by such brightSouls as thy shining self, shall comeAnd in her first ranks make thee room;Where ’mongst her snowy familyImmortal welcomes wait for thee.
     O what delight, when reveal’d Life shall standAnd teach thy lips heav’n with his hand,On which thou now mayst to thy wishesHeap up thy consecrated kisses.What joys shall seize thy soul when she,Bending her blessed eyes on thee,(Those second smiles of heav’n) shall dartHer mild rays through thy melting heart!
     Angels, thy old friends, there shall greet thee,Glad at their own home now to meet thee.
     All thy good works which went beforeAnd waited for thee, at the door,Shall own thee there, and all in oneWeave a constellationOf crowns, with which the King, thy spouse,Shall build up thy triumphant brows.
     All thy old woes shall now smile on thee,And thy pains sit bright upon thee;All thy sorrows here shall shine,All thy suff’rings be divine;Tears shall take comfort and turn gems,And wrongs repent to diadems.Ev’n thy deaths shall live, and newDress the soul that erst they slew;Thy wounds shall blush to such bright scarsAs keep account of the Lamb’s wars.
     Those rare works where thou shalt leave writLove’s noble history, with witTaught thee by none but him, while hereThey feed our souls, shall clothe thine there.Each heav’nly word by whose hid flameOur hard hearts shall strike fire, the sameShall flourish on thy brows, and beBoth fire to us and flame to thee,Whose light shall live bright in thy faceBy glory, in our hearts by grace.
     Thou shalt look round about and seeThousands of crown’d souls throng to beThemselves thy crown; sons of thy vows,The virgin-births with which thy sovereign spouseMade fruitful thy fair soul, go nowAnd with them all about thee, bowTo him. “Put on,” he’ll say, “put on,My rosy love, that thy rich zoneSparkling with the sacred flamesOf thousand souls whose happy namesHeav’n keeps upon thy score. Thy brightLife brought them first to kiss the lightThat kindled them to stars.” And soThou with the Lamb, thy Lord, shalt go,And wheresoe’er he sets his whiteSteps, walk with him those ways of lightWhich who in death would live to seeMust learn in life to die like thee.

1 Come on, my partners in distress, My comrades through the wilderness,    Who still your bodies feel; Awhile forget your griefs and fears, And look beyond this vale of tears    To that celestial hill.                                2 Beyond the bounds of time and space Look forward to that heavenly place,    The saints’ secure abode; On faith’s strong eagle pinions rise, And force your passage to the skies,    And scale the mount of God.                                3 Who suffer with our Master here, We shall before his face appear,    And by his side sit down; To patient faith the prize is sure, And all that to the end endure    The cross, shall wear the crown.                                4 Thrice blessed bliss-inspiring hope! It lifts the fainting spirits up,    It brings to life the dead; Our conflicts here shall soon be past, And you and I ascend at last    Triumphant with our head.                                5 The great mysterious Deity We soon with open face shall see;    The beatific sight Shall fill heaven’s sounding courts with praise, And wide diffuse the golden blaze    Of everlasting light.                                6 The Father shining on his throne, The glorious, co-eternal Son,    The Spirit, one and seven, Conspire our rapture to complete, And lo! we fall before his feet,    And silence heightens heaven.                                7 In hope of that ecstatic pause, Jesu, we now sustain the cross,    And at thy footstool fall, Till thou our hidden life reveal, Till thou our ravished spirits fill,    And God is all in all.

1 My God! I know, I feel thee mine,    And will not quit my claim Till all I have is lost in thine,    And all renewed I am.                          2 I hold thee with a trembling hand,    But will not let thee go Till steadfastly by faith I stand,    And all thy goodness know.                          3 When shall I see the welcome hour    That plants my God in me! Spirit of health, and life, and power,    And perfect liberty!                          4 Jesu, thine all-victorious love    Shed in my heart abroad! Then shall my feet no longer rove,    Rooted and fixed in God.                          5 Love only can the conquest win,    The strength of sin subdue (Mine own unconquerable sin),    And form my soul anew.                          6 Love can bow down the stubborn neck,    The stone to flesh convert; Soften, and melt, and pierce, and break    An adamantine heart.                          7 Oh, that in me the sacred fire    Might now begin to glow, Burn up the dross of base desire,    And make the mountains flow!                          8 Oh, that it now from heaven might fall,    And all my sins consume! Come, Holy Ghost, for thee I call,    Spirit of burning, come!                          9 Refining fire, go through my heart,    Illuminate my soul; Scatter thy life through every part,    And sanctify the whole.                          10 Sorrow and sin shall then expire,    While, entered into rest, I only live my God t’admire—    My God forever blest.                          11 No longer then my heart shall mourn,    While purified by grace I only for his glory burn,    And always see his face.                          12 My steadfast soul, from falling free,    Shall then no longer move; But Christ be all the world to me,    And all my heart be love.

At the London Zoo a toddler falls over the rail
of the Primate World only if you close your eyes 
and a female gorilla comes to sit by, to circle
her long dark arm around him only this one time 
while the others stay away. The zookeeper says
she lost a baby earlier this year only just barely 
and they’ve been waiting months for her tits to dry.
The boy’s mother watches from above  only when I say so the thirty minutes it takes
the right person to lower the right ladder down  only as a last resort. In the interim a newscaster
whose station carries it live only if you promise 
not to let go

For Ana Menendez



It only takes one night with the wind on its knees
to imagine Carl Sandburg unfolding
a map of Chicago, puzzled, then walking the wrong way. 
The lines on his face are hard to read. I alternate
between the tv, where a plastic surgeon is claiming
that every facial expression causes wrinkles, and 
the newspaper. I picture the surgeon reading the lines
on Sandburg’s face, lines that would’ve made more sense
if the poet had been, say, a tree growing 
in a wind orchard. Maybe he simply smiled too much.
I’m reading about the All-Star game, thinking
that maybe Sandburg saw the White Sox of 1919.
 
. . .  
I love American newspapers, the way each section
is folded independently and believes it owns
the world. There’s this brief item in the inter- 
national pages: the Chinese government has posted
signs in Tiananmen Square, forbidding laughter.
I’m sure the plastic surgeon would approve, he’d say 
the Chinese will look young much longer, their faces
unnaturally smooth, but what I see (although
no photograph accompanies the story) is laughter 
bursting inside them. I go back to the sports section
and a closeup of a rookie in mid-swing, his face
keeping all the wrong emotions in check.
 
. . .  
When I read I bite my lower lip, a habit
the plastic surgeon would probably call
cosmetic heresy because it accelerates the aging 
process. I think of Carl Sandburg and the White Sox;
I think of wind in Tiananmen Square, how a country
deprived of laughter ages invisibly; I think 
of the Great Walls of North America, each of them
a grip on some outfield like a rookie’s hands
around a bat when the wind is against him; I bite 
my lower lip again; I want to learn
to think in American, to believe that a headline
is a fact and all stories are suspect.

I am learning to abandon the world
before it can abandon me.
Already I have given up the moon
and snow, closing my shades
against the claims of white.
And the world has taken
my father, my friends.
I have given up melodic lines of hills,
moving to a flat, tuneless landscape.
And every night I give my body up
limb by limb, working upwards
across bone, towards the heart.
But morning comes with small
reprieves of coffee and birdsong.
A tree outside the window
which was simply shadow moments ago
takes back its branches twig
by leafy twig.
And as I take my body back
the sun lays its warm muzzle on my lap
as if to make amends.

                    I am the last Napoleonic soldier. It’s almost two hundred years later and I am still retreating from Moscow. The road is lined with white birch trees and the mud comes up to my knees. The one-eyed woman wants to sell me a chicken, and I don’t even have any clothes on.      
       The Germans are going one way; I am going the other. The Russians are going still another way and waving good-by. I have a ceremonial saber. I use it to cut my hair, which is four feet long.

I had just won $115 from the headshakers and
was naked upon my bed
listening to an opera by one of the Italians
and had just gotten rid of a very loose lady
when there was a knock upon the wood,
and since the cops had just raided a month or so ago,
I screamed out rather on edge—
who the hell is it? what you want, man?
I’m your publisher! somebody screamed back,
and I hollered, I don’t have a publisher,
try the place next door, and he screamed back,
you’re Charles Bukowski, aren’t you? and I got up and
peeked through the iron grill to make sure it wasn’t a cop,
and I placed a robe upon my nakedness,
kicked a beercan out of the way and bade them enter,
an editor and a poet.
only one would drink a beer (the editor)
so I drank two for the poet and one for myself
and they sat there sweating and watching me
and I sat there trying to explain
that I wasn’t really a poet in the ordinary sense,
I told them about the stockyards and the slaughterhouse
and the racetracks and the conditions of some of our jails,
and the editor suddenly pulled five magazines out of a portfolio
and tossed them in between the beercans
and we talked about Flowers of Evil, Rimbaud, Villon,
and what some of the modern poets looked like:
J.B. May and Wolf the Hedley are very immaculate, clean fingernails, etc.;
I apologized for the beercans, my beard, and everything on the floor
and pretty soon everybody was yawning
and the editor suddenly stood up and I said,
are you leaving?
and then the editor and the poet were walking out the door,
and then I thought well hell they might not have liked
what they saw
but I’m not selling beercans and Italian opera and
torn stockings under the bed and dirty fingernails,
I’m selling rhyme and life and line,
and I walked over and cracked a new can of beer
and I looked at the five magazines with my name on the cover
and wondered what it meant,
wondered if we are writing poetry or all huddling in
one big tent
                  clasping assholes.

I went over the other day
to pick up my daughter.
her mother came out with workman’s
overalls on.
I gave her the child support money
and she laid a sheaf of poems on me by one
Manfred Anderson.
I read them.
he’s great, she said.
does he send this shit out? I asked.
oh no, she said, Manfred wouldn’t do that.
why?
well, I don’t know exactly.
listen, I said, you know all the poets who
don’t send their shit out.
the magazines aren’t ready for them, she said,
they’re too far advanced for publication.
oh for christ’s sake, I said, do you really
believe that?
yes, yes, I really believe that, she
answered.
look, I said, you don’t even have the kid ready
yet. she doesn’t have her shoes on. can’t you
put her shoes on?
your daughter is 8 years old, she said,
she can put her own shoes on.
listen, I said to my daughter, for christ’s sake
will you put your shoes on?
Manfred never screams, said her mother.
OH HOLY JESUS CHRIST! I yelled
you see, you see? she said, you haven’t changed.
what time is it? I asked.
4:30. Manfred did submit some poems once, she said,
but they sent them back and he was terribly
upset.
you’ve got your shoes on, I said to my daughter,
let’s go.
her mother walked to the door with us.
have a nice day, she said.
fuck off, I said.
when she closed the door there was a sign pasted to
the outside. it said:
SMILE.
I didn’t.
we drove down Pico on the way in.
I stopped outside the Red Ox.
I’ll be right back, I told my daughter.
I walked in, sat down, and ordered a scotch and
water. over the bar there was a little guy popping in and
out of a door holding a very red, curved penis
in his hand.
can’t
can’t you make him stop? I asked the barkeep.
can’t you shut that thing off?
what’s the matter with you, buddy? he asked.
I submit my poems to the magazines, I said.
you submit your poems to the magazines? he asked.
you are god damned right I do, I said.
I finished my drink and got back to the car.
I drove down Pico Boulevard.
the remainder of the day was bound to be better.

I care not for these ladies,That must be wooed and prayed:Give me kind Amaryllis,The wanton country maid.Nature art disdaineth,Her beauty is her own.
  Her when we court and kiss,    
  She cries, “Forsooth, let go!”
  But when we come where comfort is,
  She never will say no.
If I love Amaryllis,She gives me fruit and flowers:But if we love these ladies,We must give golden showers.Give them gold, that sell love,Give me the nut-brown lass,
  Who, when we court and kiss,
  She cries, “Forsooth, let go!”
  But when we come where comfort is,
  She never will say no.
These ladies must have pillows,And beds by strangers wrought;Give me a bower of willows,Of moss and leaves unbought,And fresh Amaryllis,With milk and honey fed;
  Who, when we court and kiss,
  She cries, “Forsooth, let go!”
  But when we come where comfort is,
  She never will say no.

I close my eyes like a good little boy at night in bed,
as I was told to do by my mother when she lived,
and before bed I brush my teeth and slip on my pajamas,
as I was told, and look forward to tomorrow. 
I do all things required of me to make me a citizen of sterling worth.
I keep a job and come home each evening for dinner. I arrive at the
same time on the same train to give my family a sense of order. 
I obey traffic signals. I am cordial to strangers, I answer my
mail promptly. I keep a balanced checking account. Why can’t I
live forever?

I cry your mercy—pity—love!—aye, love!
 Merciful love that tantalizes not,One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,
 Unmasked, and being seen—without a blot!O! let me have thee whole,—all—all—be mine!
 That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zestOf love, your kiss,—those hands, those eyes divine,
 That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast,Yourself—your soul—in pity give me all,
 Withhold no atom’s atom or I dieOr living on perhaps, your wretched thrall,
 Forget, in the mist of idle misery,Life’s purposes,—the palate of my mind
 Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!

I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges,
I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch, the   
red tiles glinting like bent
plates of blood behind his head, I
see my mother with a few light books at her hip
standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks,
the wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its
sword-tips aglow in the May air,
they are about to graduate, they are about to get married,   
they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are   
innocent, they would never hurt anybody.   
I want to go up to them and say Stop,   
don’t do it—she’s the wrong woman,   
he’s the wrong man, you are going to do things
you cannot imagine you would ever do,   
you are going to do bad things to children,
you are going to suffer in ways you have not heard of,
you are going to want to die. I want to go
up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it,
her hungry pretty face turning to me,   
her pitiful beautiful untouched body,
his arrogant handsome face turning to me,   
his pitiful beautiful untouched body,   
but I don’t do it. I want to live. I   
take them up like the male and female   
paper dolls and bang them together   
at the hips, like chips of flint, as if to   
strike sparks from them, I say
Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it.

Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck,
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,
The wood-cutter’s song, the ploughboy’s on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown,
The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing,
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,
The day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.

I killed a fly
and laid my weapon next to it
as one lays the weapon of a dead hero
beside his body—the fly
that tried to mount the window
to its top; that was born out of a swamp
to die in a bold effort beyond itself,
and I am the one who brought it to an end.
Tired of the day and with night coming on
I lay my body down beside the fly.

I knew a woman, lovely in her bones,
When small birds sighed, she would sigh back at them;   
Ah, when she moved, she moved more ways than one:   
The shapes a bright container can contain!
Of her choice virtues only gods should speak,
Or English poets who grew up on Greek
(I’d have them sing in chorus, cheek to cheek). 
How well her wishes went! She stroked my chin,   
She taught me Turn, and Counter-turn, and Stand;   
She taught me Touch, that undulant white skin;   
I nibbled meekly from her proffered hand;   
She was the sickle; I, poor I, the rake,
Coming behind her for her pretty sake
(But what prodigious mowing we did make). 
Love likes a gander, and adores a goose:
Her full lips pursed, the errant note to seize;
She played it quick, she played it light and loose;   
My eyes, they dazzled at her flowing knees;   
Her several parts could keep a pure repose,   
Or one hip quiver with a mobile nose
(She moved in circles, and those circles moved). 
Let seed be grass, and grass turn into hay:   
I’m martyr to a motion not my own;
What’s freedom for? To know eternity.
I swear she cast a shadow white as stone.   
But who would count eternity in days?
These old bones live to learn her wanton ways:   
(I measure time by how a body sways).

As a child
I put my finger in the fire
to become
a saint. 
As a teenager
every day I would knock my head against the wall. 
As a young girl
I went out through a window of a garret
to the roof
in order to jump. 
As a woman
I had lice all over my body.
They cracked when I was ironing my sweater. 
I waited sixty minutes
to be executed.
I was hungry for six years. 
Then I bore a child,
they were carving me
without putting me to sleep. 
Then a thunderbolt killed me
three times and I had to rise from the dead three times
without anyone’s help. 
Now I am resting
after three resurrections.

As I sd to my

I know that all beneath the moon decays,And what by mortals in this world is brought,In Time’s great periods shall return to nought;That fairest states have fatal nights and days;I know how all the Muse’s heavenly lays,With toil of spright which are so dearly bought,As idle sounds of few or none are sought,And that nought lighter is than airy praise.I know frail beauty like the purple flower,To which one morn oft birth and death affords;That love a jarring is of minds’ accords,Where sense and will invassal reason’s power:Know what I list, this all can not me move,But that, O me! I both must write and love.

Our embrace lasted too long.
We loved right down to the bone.
I hear the bones grind, I see
our two skeletons. 
Now I am waiting
till you leave, till
the clatter of your shoes
is heard no more. Now, silence. 
Tonight I am going to sleep alone
on the bedclothes of purity.
Aloneness
is the first hygienic measure.
Aloneness
will enlarge the walls of the room,
I will open the window
and the large, frosty air will enter,
healthy as tragedy.
Human thoughts will enter
and human concerns,
misfortune of others, saintliness of others.
They will converse softly and sternly. 
Do not come anymore.
I am an animal
very rarely.

Some little splinter
Of shadow purls
And weals down
The slewed stone
Chapel steps,
Slinks along
The riverrock wall
And disappears
Into the light.
Now ropy, riffled,
Now owlish, sere,
It smolders back
To sight beneath
A dwarfish, brindled tree
That chimes and sifts
And resurrects
In something’s sweet
And lethal breath.
This little shadow
Seems to know
(How can it know?
How can it not?)
Just when to flinch
Just where to loop and sag
And skitter down,
Just what to squirrel
And what to squander till
The light it lacks
Bleeds it back
And finds
My sleeping dark-haired girl —
O personal,
Impersonal,
Continual thrall —
And hammocks blue
In the hollows of her eyes.


^^EOP^^

I love all beauteous things,
   I seek and adore them;God hath no better praise,And man in his hasty days
   Is honoured for them.
I too will something make
   And joy in the making;Altho’ to-morrow it seemLike the empty words of a dream
   Remembered on waking.


^^EOP^^

I love your lips when they’re wet with wine
  And red with a wild desire;I love your eyes when the lovelight lies
  Lit with a passionate fire.I love your arms when the warm white flesh
  Touches mine in a fond embrace;I love your hair when the strands enmesh
  Your kisses against my face.
Not for me the cold, calm kiss
  Of a virgin’s bloodless love;Not for me the saint’s white bliss,
  Nor the heart of a spotless dove.But give me the love that so freely gives
  And laughs at the whole world’s blame,With your body so young and warm in my arms,
  It sets my poor heart aflame.
So kiss me sweet with your warm wet mouth,
  Still fragrant with ruby wine,And say with a fervor born of the South
  That your body and soul are mine.Clasp me close in your warm young arms,
  While the pale stars shine above,And we’ll live our whole young lives away
  In the joys of a living love.


^^EOP^^

Even your odds and ends.
I love your teeth, crazy bones,
Madcap knees and elbows.
Forearm and backhand
Hair makes you animal.
Rare among things.
The small of your back could pool rain
Into water a main might drink. Perfect,
From the whirlpools your fingers print
On everything you touch
To the moons on the nails of all ten toes
Rising and setting inside your shoes
Wherever you go.

            Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda. – Dante
           
            Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
            E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore. – Petrarca 



I loved you first: but afterwards your love
Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.
Which owes the other most? my love was long,
And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;
I loved and guessed at you, you construed me
And loved me for what might or might not be –
Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
For verily love knows not ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’
With separate ‘I’ and ‘thou’ free love has done,
For one is both and both are one in love:
Rich love knows nought of ‘thine that is not mine;’
Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
Both of us, of the love which makes us one.

when even you, when sound itself is neoned in?

when bells came like boats

And a man slumped,

against pink shingles

I tell you that I see her still
At the dark entrance of the hall.
One gas lamp burning near her shoulder
Shone also from her other side
Where hung the long inaccurate glass
Whose pictures were as troubled water.
An immense shadow had its hand
Between us on the floor, and seemed
To hump the knuckles nervously,
A giant crab readying to walk,
Or a blanket moving in its sleep. 
You will remember, with a smile
Instructed by movies to reminisce,
How strict her corsets must have been,
How the huge arrangements of her hair
Would certainly betray the least
Impassionate displacement there.
It was no rig for dallying,
And maybe only marriage could
Derange that queenly scaffolding—
As when a great ship, coming home,
Coasts in the harbor, dropping sail
And loosing all the tackle that had laced
Her in the long lanes ....
                                       I know
We need not draw this figure out.
But all that whalebone came from whales.
And all the whales lived in the sea,
In calm beneath the troubled glass,
Until the needle drew their blood. 
I see her standing in the hall,
Where the mirror’s lashed to blood and foam,
And the black flukes of agony
Beat at the air till the light blows out.

I saw a man pursuing the horizon; Round and round they sped. I was disturbed at this;   I accosted the man. “It is futile,” I said, “You can never —”  “You lie,” he cried,   And ran on.

I saw my Lady weep,And Sorrow proud to be advanced soIn those fair eyes, where all perfections keep;
  Her face was full of woe,But such a woe (believe me) as wins more heartsThan mirth can do, with her enticing parts.
Sorrow was there made fair,And Passion, wise; Tears, a delightful thing;Silence, beyond all speech, a wisdom rare;
  She made her sighs to sing,And all things with so sweet a sadness move;As made my heart both grieve and love.
O Fairer than aught elseThe world can shew, leave off, in time, to grieve,Enough, enough! Your joyful look excels;
  Tears kill the heart, believe, O strive not to be excellent in woe,Which only breeds your beauty’s overthrow.

As I was walking one morning in spring,I heard a fair maiden most charmingly sing,All under her cow, as she sat a-milking,Saying, I shall be married, next Monday morning.
You fairest of all creatures, my eyes e’er beheld,Oh! Where do you live love, or where do you dwell,I dwell at the top of yon bonny brown hill,I shall be fifteen years old next Monday morning.
Fifteen years old love, is too young to marry,The other five years love, I’d have you to tarry,And perhaps in the meantime love you might be sorry,So put back your wedding, next Monday morning.
You talk like a man without reason or skill,Five years I’ve been waiting against my will,Now, I am resolved my mind to fulfil,I wish that tomorrow was Monday morning.
On Saturday night it is all my care,To powder my locks and curl my hair,And my two pretty maidens to wait on me there,To dance at my wedding next Monday morning.
My husband will buy me a guinea gold ring,And at night he’ll give me a far better thing,With two precious jewels he’ll be me adorning,When I am his bride, on Monday morning.

I, too, sing America. 
I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong. 
Tomorrow,
I’ll be at the table
When company comes.
Nobody’ll dare
Say to me,
“Eat in the kitchen,”
Then. 
Besides,
They’ll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed— 
I, too, am America.

White horses, tails high, rise from the cedar.
Smoke brings the fat crickets,
trembling breeze.
Find that holy place, a promise.
Embers glow like moon air. 
I call you back from the grasses.
Wake me when sand pipers
fly. They fade,
and new sounds flutter. Cattails at sunrise.
Hair matted by sleep. 
Sun on the meadow. Grey boughs lie tangled.
The ground I was born to
wants me to leave.
I’ve searched everywhere to tell you
my eyes are with the hazels. 
Wind swells through fences, drones a flat ache for hours.
At night, music would echo
from your womanless bedroom.
Far down those bleaching cliffs,
roses shed a torrent. 
Will you brush my ear? An ice bear sometimes lumbers west.
Your life still gleams, the edge melting.
I never let you know.
You showed me and how under snow and darkness,
the grasses breathe for miles.

I used to think The mind essential in the body, even As stood the body essential in the mind: Two inseparable things, by nature equal And similar, and in creation’s song Halving the total scale: it is not so. Unlike and cross like driftwood sticks they come Churned in the giddy trough: a chunk of pine, A slab of rosewood: mangled each on each With knocks and friction, or in deadly pain Sheathing each other’s splinters: till at last Without all stuff or shape they ’re jetted up Where in the bluish moisture rot whate’er Was vomited in horror from the sea.

I walk’d the other day, to spend my hour,        Into a field, Where I sometimes had seen the soil to yield        A gallant flow’r; But winter now had ruffled all the bow’r        And curious store        I knew there heretofore.  Yet I, whose search lov’d not to peep and peer        I’ th’ face of things, Thought with my self, there might be other springs        Besides this here, Which, like cold friends, sees us but once a year;        And so the flow’r        Might have some other bow’r.  Then taking up what I could nearest spy,        I digg’d about That place where I had seen him to grow out;        And by and by I saw the warm recluse alone to lie,        Where fresh and green        He liv’d of us unseen.  Many a question intricate and rare        Did I there strow; But all I could extort was, that he now        Did there repair Such losses as befell him in this air,        And would ere long        Come forth most fair and young.  This past, I threw the clothes quite o’er his head;        And stung with fear Of my own frailty dropp’d down many a tear        Upon his bed; Then sighing whisper’d, “happy are the dead!        What peace doth now        Rock him asleep below!”  And yet, how few believe such doctrine springs        From a poor root, Which all the winter sleeps here under foot,        And hath no wings To raise it to the truth and light of things;        But is still trod        By ev’ry wand’ring clod.  O Thou! whose spirit did at first inflame        And warm the dead, And by a sacred incubation fed        With life this frame, Which once had neither being, form, nor name;        Grant I may so        Thy steps track here below,  That in these masques and shadows I may see        Thy sacred way; And by those hid ascents climb to that day,        Which breaks from Thee, Who art in all things, though invisibly!        Shew me thy peace,        Thy mercy, love, and ease,  And from this care, where dreams and sorrows reign,        Lead me above, Where light, joy, leisure, and true comforts move        Without all pain; There, hid in thee, shew me his life again,        At whose dumb urn        Thus all the year I mourn.

30 dogs, 20 men on 20 horses and one fox
and look here, they write,
you are a dupe for the state, the church,
you are in the ego-dream,
read your history, study the monetary system,
note that the racial war is 23,000 years old. 
well, I remember 20 years ago, sitting with an old Jewish tailor,
his nose in the lamplight like a cannon sighted on the enemy; and
there was an Italian pharmacist who lived in an expensive apartment
in the best part of town; we plotted to overthrow
a tottering dynasty, the tailor sewing buttons on a vest,
the Italian poking his cigar in my eye, lighting me up,
a tottering dynasty myself, always drunk as possible,
well-read, starving, depressed, but actually
a good young piece of ass would have solved all my rancor,
but I didn’t know this; I listened to my Italian and my Jew
and I went out down dark alleys smoking borrowed cigarettes
and watching the backs of houses come down in flames,
but somewhere we missed: we were not men enough,
       large or small enough,
or we only wanted to talk or we were bored, so the anarchy
       fell through,
and the Jew died and the Italian grew angry because I stayed
       with his
wife when he went down to the pharmacy; he did not care to have
his personal government overthrown, and she overthrew easy, and
I had some guilt: the children were asleep in the other bedroom
but later I won $200 in a crap game and took a bus to New Orleans
and I stood on the corner listening to the music coming from bars
and then I went inside to the bars,
and I sat there thinking about the dead Jew,
how all he did was sew on buttons and talk,
and how he gave way although he was stronger than any of us
he gave way because his bladder would not go on,
and maybe that saved Wall Street and Manhattan
and the Church and Central Park West and Rome and the
Left Bank, but the pharmacist’s wife, she was nice,
she was tired of bombs under the pillow and hissing the Pope,
and she had a very nice figure, very good legs,
but I guess she felt as I: that the weakness was not Government
but Man, one at a time, that men were never as strong as
       their ideas
and that ideas were governments turned into men;
and so it began on a couch with a spilled martini
and it ended in the bedroom: desire, revolution,
nonsense ended, and the shades rattled in the wind,
rattled like sabers, cracked like cannon,
and 30 dogs, 20 men on 20 horses chased one fox
across the fields under the sun,
and I got out of bed and yawned and scratched my belly
and knew that soon      very soon      I would have to get
very drunk      again.

We watched from the house
as the river grew, helpless
and terrible in its unfamiliar body.   
Wrestling everything into it,
the water wrapped around trees
until their life-hold was broken.
They went down, one by one,
and the river dragged off their covering. 
Nests of the herons, roots washed to bones,   
snags of soaked bark on the shoreline:   
a whole forest pulled through the teeth   
of the spillway. Trees surfacing
singly, where the river poured off
into arteries for fields below the reservation. 
When at last it was over, the long removal,   
they had all become the same dry wood.   
We walked among them, the branches   
whitening in the raw sun.
Above us drifted herons,
alone, hoarse-voiced, broken,
settling their beaks among the hollows.
Grandpa said, These are the ghosts of the tree people   
moving among us, unable to take their rest.

The black kitten cries at her bowl meek meek and the gray one glowers
from the windowsill. My hand on the can
to serve them. First day of spring.
Yesterday I drove my little mother for hours
through wet snow. Her eightieth birthday.
What she wanted was that ride with me—
shopping, gossiping, mulling old grievances,
1930, 1958, 1970.
How cruel the world has been to her,
how uncanny she’s survived it.
In her bag, a birthday card
from “my Nemesis,” signed Sincerely

Sonnet VII



I would I might forget that I am I,And break the heavy chain that binds me fast,Whose links about myself my deeds have cast.What in the body’s tomb doth buried lieIs boundless; ’tis the spirit of the sky,Lord of the future, guardian of the past,And soon must forth, to know his own at last.In his large life to live, I fain would die.Happy the dumb beast, hungering for food,But calling not his suffering his own;Blessèd the angel, gazing on all good,But knowing not he sits upon a throne;Wretched the mortal, pondering his mood,And doomed to know his aching heart alone.

I would like to describe the simplest emotion
joy or sadness
but not as others do
reaching for shafts of rain or sun 
I would like to describe a light
which is being born in me
but I know it does not resemble
any star
for it is not so bright
not so pure
and is uncertain 
I would like to describe courage
without dragging behind me a dusty lion
and also anxiety
without shaking a glass full of water 
to put it another way
I would give all metaphors
in return for one word
drawn out of my breast like a rib
for one word
contained within the boundaries
of my skin 
but apparently this is not possible 
and just to say—I love
I run around like mad
picking up handfuls of birds
and my tenderness
which after all is not made of water
asks the water for a face 
and anger
different from fire
borrows from it
a loquacious tongue 
so is blurred
so is blurred
in me
what white-haired gentlemen
separated once and for all
and said
this is the subject
and this is the object 
we fall asleep
with one hand under our head
and with the other in a mound of planets 
our feet abandon us
and taste the earth
with their tiny roots
which next morning
we tear out painfully

Ianthe! you are call’d to cross the sea!          A path forbidden me! Remember, while the Sun his blessing sheds          Upon the mountain-heads, How often we have watcht him laying down          His brow, and dropt our own Against each other’s, and how faint and short          And sliding the support! What will succeed it now? Mine is unblest,          Ianthe! nor will rest But on the very thought that swells with pain.          O bid me hope again! O give me back what Earth, what (without you)          Not Heaven itself can do— One of the golden days that we have past,          And let it be my last! Or else the gift would be, however sweet,          Fragile and incomplete.

Cold for so long, unable to speak,
yet your mouth seems framed
on a cry, or a stifled question. 
Who placed you here, and left you
to this lonely eternity of ash and ice,
and himself returned to the dust
fields, the church and the temple? 
Was it God—the sun-god of the Incas,
the imperial god of the Spaniards?
Or only the priests of that god,
self-elected—voice of the volcano
that speaks once in a hundred years. 
And I wonder, with your image before me,
what life might you have lived,
had you lived at all—whose companion,
whose love? To be perhaps no more
than a slave of that earthly master: 
a jug of water on your shoulder,
year after stunted year, a bundle
of reeds and corn, kindling
for a fire on whose buried hearth? 
There were furies to be fed, then
as now: blood to fatten the sun,
a heart for the lightning to strike. 
And now the furies walk the streets,
a swarm in the milling crowd.
They stand to the podium, speak
of their coming ascension ... 
Through all this drift and clamor
you have survived—in this cramped
and haunted effigy, another entry
on the historian’s dated page. 
Under the weight of this mountain—
once a god, now only restless stone,
we find your interrupted life,
placed here among the trilobites
and shells, so late unearthed.

So fallen! so lost! the light withdrawn
   Which once he wore!The glory from his gray hairs gone
   Forevermore!
Revile him not, the Tempter hath
   A snare for all;And pitying tears, not scorn and wrath,
   Befit his fall!
Oh, dumb be passion’s stormy rage,
   When he who mightHave lighted up and led his age,
   Falls back in night.
Scorn! would the angels laugh, to mark
   A bright soul driven,Fiend-goaded, down the endless dark,
   From hope and heaven!
Let not the land once proud of him
   Insult him now,Nor brand with deeper shame his dim,
   Dishonored brow.
But let its humbled sons, instead,
   From sea to lake,A long lament, as for the dead,
   In sadness make.
Of all we loved and honored, naught
   Save power remains;A fallen angel’s pride of thought,
   Still strong in chains.
All else is gone; from those great eyes
   The soul has fled:When faith is lost, when honor dies,
   The man is dead!
Then, pay the reverence of old days
   To his dead fame;Walk backward, with averted gaze,
   And hide the shame!

If he from heaven that filched that living fire Condemned by Jove to endless torment be, I greatly marvel how you still go free, That far beyond Prometheus did aspire. The fire he stole, although of heavenly kind, Which from above he craftily did take, Of liveless clods, us living men to make, He did bestow in temper of the mind. But you broke into heaven’s immortal store, Where virtue, honor, wit, and beauty lay; Which taking thence you have escaped away, Yet stand as free as ere you did before;    Yet old Prometheus punished for his rape.    Thus poor thieves suffer when the greater ‘scape.

Why should your fair eyes with such sovereign grace Disperse their rays on every vulgar spirit, Whilst I in darkness in the self-same place Get not one glance to recompense my merit? So doth the ploughman gaze the wandering star, And only rest contented with the light, That never learned what constellations are, Beyond the bent of his unknowing sight, O! why should beauty, custom to obey, To their gross sense apply herself so ill? Would God I were as ignorant as they, When I am made unhappy by my skill; Only compelled on this poor good to boast, Heavens are not kind to them that know them most.

To Proverbs



As Love and I, late harbour’d in one inn, With proverbs thus each other entertain: In love there is no lack, thus I begin, Fair words make fools, replieth he again; Who spares to speak, doth spare to speed (quoth I), As well (saith he) too forward, as too slow; Fortune assists the boldest, I reply, A hasty man (quoth he) ne’er wanted woe; Labour is light, where love (quoth I) doth pay, (Saith he) light burthen’s heavy, if far born; (Quoth I) the main lost, cast the bye away; You have spun a fair thread, he replies in scorn.     And having thus awhile each other thwarted,     Fools as we met, so fools again we parted.


^^EOP^^

Since there’s no help, come let us kiss and part. Nay, I have done, you get no more of me; And I am glad, yea glad with all my heart, That thus so cleanly I myself can free. Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows, And when we meet at any time again, Be it not seen in either of our brows That we one jot of former love retain. Now at the last gasp of Love’s latest breath, When, his pulse failing, Passion speechless lies; When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death, And Innocence is closing up his eyes— Now, if thou wouldst, when all have given him over, From death to life thou might’st him yet recover!

Taped to the wall of my cell are 47 pictures: 47 black
faces: my father, mother, grandmothers (1 dead), grand-
fathers (both dead), brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts,
cousins (1st & 2nd), nieces, and nephews. They stare
across the space at me sprawling on my bunk. I know
their dark eyes, they know mine. I know their style,
they know mine. I am all of them, they are all of me;
they are farmers, I am a thief, I am me, they are thee. 
I have at one time or another been in love with my mother,
1 grandmother, 2 sisters, 2 aunts (1 went to the asylum),
and 5 cousins. I am now in love with a 7-yr-old niece
(she sends me letters written in large block print, and
her picture is the only one that smiles at me). 
I have the same name as 1 grandfather, 3 cousins, 3 nephews,
and 1 uncle. The uncle disappeared when he was 15, just took
off and caught a freight (they say). He’s discussed each year
when the family has a reunion, he causes uneasiness in
the clan, he is an empty space. My father’s mother, who is 93
and who keeps the Family Bible with everybody’s birth dates
(and death dates) in it, always mentions him. There is no
place in her Bible for “whereabouts unknown.”

Each fall the graves of my grandfathers call me, the brown
hills and red gullies of mississippi send out their electric
messages, galvanizing my genes. Last yr / like a salmon quitting
the cold ocean-leaping and bucking up his birthstream / I
hitchhiked my way from LA with 16 caps in my packet and a
monkey on my back. And I almost kicked it with the kinfolks.
I walked barefooted in my grandmother’s backyard / I smelled the old
land and the woods / I sipped cornwhiskey from fruit jars with the men /
I flirted with the women / I had a ball till the caps ran out
and my habit came down. That night I looked at my grandmother
and split / my guts were screaming for junk / but I was almost
contented / I had almost caught up with me.
(The next day in Memphis I cracked a croaker’s crib for a fix.) 
This yr there is a gray stone wall damming my stream, and when
the falling leaves stir my genes, I pace my cell or flop on my bunk
and stare at 47 black faces across the space. I am all of them,
they are all of me, I am me, they are thee, and I have no children
to float in the space between.

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.   
The water never formed to mind or voice,   
Like a body wholly body, fluttering
Its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion   
Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry,   
That was not ours although we understood,   
Inhuman, of the veritable ocean. 
The sea was not a mask. No more was she.   
The song and water were not medleyed sound   
Even if what she sang was what she heard,   
Since what she sang was uttered word by word.
It may be that in all her phrases stirred   
The grinding water and the gasping wind;   
But it was she and not the sea we heard. 
For she was the maker of the song she sang.   
The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea
Was merely a place by which she walked to sing.   
Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew   
It was the spirit that we sought and knew   
That we should ask this often as she sang. 
If it was only the dark voice of the sea   
That rose, or even colored by many waves;   
If it was only the outer voice of sky
And cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,   
However clear, it would have been deep air,   
The heaving speech of air, a summer sound   
Repeated in a summer without end
And sound alone. But it was more than that,   
More even than her voice, and ours, among
The meaningless plungings of water and the wind,   
Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped   
On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres   
Of sky and sea. 
                           It was her voice that made   
The sky acutest at its vanishing.   
She measured to the hour its solitude.   
She was the single artificer of the world
In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,   
Whatever self it had, became the self
That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,   
As we beheld her striding there alone,
Knew that there never was a world for her   
Except the one she sang and, singing, made. 
Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,   
Why, when the singing ended and we turned   
Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights,   
The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,   
As the night descended, tilting in the air,   
Mastered the night and portioned out the sea,   
Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,   
Arranging, deepening, enchanting night. 
Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,   
The maker’s rage to order words of the sea,   
Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,   
And of ourselves and of our origins,
In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.

(‘Brother Square-Toes’—Rewards and Fairies)



If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: 
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: 
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ 
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

She could tell he loved her. He wanted her there   
sitting in the front pew when he preached.   
He liked to watch her putting up her hair
and ate whatever she cooked and never broached 
the subject of the years before they met.   
He was thoughtful always. He let her say   
whether or not they did anything in bed
and tried to learn the games she tried to play. 
She could tell how deep his feeling ran.
He liked to say her name and bought her stuff   
for no good reason. He was a gentle man.   
How few there are she knew well enough. 
He sometimes reached to flick away a speck   
of something on her clothes and didn’t drum   
his fingers on the table when she spoke.
What would he do if he knew she had a dream 
sometimes, slipping out of her nightgown—
if ever God forbid he really knew her—
to slip once out of the house and across town

Wedlock, as old Men note, hath likened been, Unto a publick Crowd or common Rout; Where those that are without would fain get in, And those that are within would fain get out. Grief often treads upon the Heels of Pleasure, Marry’d in Haste, we oft repent at Leisure; Some by Experience find these Words misplac’ed, Marry’d at Leisure, they repent in Haste.

Touching your goodness, I am like a man
Who turns a letter over in his hand
And you might think this was because the hand
Was unfamiliar but, truth is, the man
Has never had a letter from anyone;
And now he is both afraid of what it means
And ashamed because he has no other means
To find out what it says than to ask someone. 
His uncle could have left the farm to him,
Or his parents died before he sent them word,
Or the dark girl changed and want him for beloved.
Afraid and letter-proud, he keeps it with him.
What would you call his feeling for the words
That keep him rich and orphaned and beloved?

Likely as not a ruined head gasket
Spitting at every power stroke, if not a crank shaft
Bearing knocking at the roots of the thing like a pile-driver:   
A machine involved with itself, a concentrated
Hot lump of a machine
Geared in the loose mechanics of the world with the valves jumping
And the heavy frenzy of the pistons. When the thing stops,   
Is stopped, with the last slow cough
In the manifold, the flywheel blundering
Against compression, stopping, finally
Stopped, compression leaking
From the idle cylinders will one imagine
Then because he can imagine
That squeezed from the cooling steel
There hovers in that moment, wraith-like and like a plume of steam, an aftermath,
A still and quiet angel of knowledge and of comprehension.  
2 
Endlessly, endlessly,
The definition of mortality 
The image of the engine 
That stops.
We cannot live on that.
I know that no one would live out
Thirty years, fifty years if the world were ending   
With his life.
The machine stares out,
Stares out
With all its eyes 
Thru the glass
With the ripple in it, past the sill
Which is dusty—If there is someone
In the garden!
Outside, and so beautiful.  
3 
What ends
Is that.
          Even companionship   
Ending. 
‘I want to ask if you remember
When we were happy! As tho all travels 
Ended untold, all embarkations   
Foundered.  
4 
On that water
Grey with morning
The gull will fold its wings   
And sit. And with its two eyes   
There as much as anything
Can watch a ship and all its hallways
And all companions sink.  
5  Also he has set the world
In their hearts.

PART ONE  I 
Slip-pilings on the Brooklyn littoral
—the poles still tarry, flimsy; the ferry terminus
with its walledup doors wan doorshapes
on eroded sills. Downstream, the strutwork
of the Williamsburg cable tower
threw its cool shadow half a mile inland
over tarpaper seams, gantried water butts,
and splintery tenement cornices milled
with acanthus and classical grasses
of nineteenth-century dream-slum fantasy.
We could see, from our rooftops, the endspan
floating its ant-threads of traffic
to the granite salients of the anchorage,
and through its strands on the west
the Financial District’s watery silhouettes. 
But it was our own foundations, crumbling
in the sandy soil, that made us protest
the drill rigs sounding for a wider bridge ramp
to funnel the airport traffic over us
into Manhattan. “Construction tremors
will weaken our buildings”: from the over-roosted
tenements clinging near the anchorage
flew manuscript lists of signatures, block-groups’
painfully Englished petitions. But City Hall
adoze, sleep-feeding, just flooded us   II 
with chimerical figures and blueprints,
wearing us down. Our own “block-leader,” Luz,
a Guatemalan law student at NYU
where I studied classics, distracted us
more easily with her “pure language”
or anti-Puerto Rican tirades. “Call that Spanish?
Take my sitter—muy indio, still speaks some
Maya mountain-language BUT
the beautiful Spanish!” And so one evening this sitter,
Pilar, came over—forty, perhaps, with a long
fawn-tinted oval face, and read in low tones
an archaic poem to the Madonna. “My daughter
knows it in Quiché and English—” and she passed around,
wistfully, a First Communion photo—flat cheekbones
like her mother’s, long black braids, straight look. 
Luz told us Pilar had lost husband
and son to the Violence; a machine-gunned
death heap in the center of their village—
“They killed all the men. But when my family
came here, she came with her girl, we helped with the
green card, and she’s a hotel maid now
near the UN ...” Much realer, this, than our own
bridge-inflicted, some-day disaster. And who knew
but our bridge might metamorphose,
as the City said (“Global cities draw capital”), into a river
of money (“We’ll all sell cuchifritos on the ramp”),
and anyway, mainly, summer   III 
was running out, with its open evenings
and windows. One Saturday, turning onto my block
from the subway, I heard my name, crossed
the street where twin buildings had area-ways.
and saw you waving, the same, Pilar,
from a window below the swag-bellied area railings.
“Come have some coffee—go around in back.”
I walked down the building-side, and turned in a trash-littered
airwell by a door with multiple doorbells.
You opened from a wooden hallway, unpainted,
with padlocked doors. “See, the super’s cut up his flat
for illegals. They took out an inside wall, so our room
has a window—we all share the bath.” I entered
a lime-walled room—chairs and table, sofa-bed. Your front wall
was the building front, the three others
drywall. On the bureau, a black-shawled prie-dieu: two photos; two candles in translucent, white-waxed sacks,
and a polychrome Madonna with meeting brows. 
Through your window, car wheels, railings; and, above,
my own second-story windows. “We saw you
reading there,” you said from behind me, “when we moved in.”
You sat me on the sofa, and formally presented your daughter
(she moved her schoolbooks all to one end.) Near her, a shallow,
linoleumed-over trench and a bathroom sink. You said:
“I’m a widow from the mountains near Morache, very near
the home-town of Señora Luz. My real work is hotel maid, and I’ve got
a nice job, at a place called the Tricontinental.”
Then you paused, and I felt how clearly
you’d presented yourself, as Americans do, with your job,
your état civil, and I said: “I’m a graduate student
at NYU, where Luz studies, no, not married, no children ...”
I tried to add something else at once, to leave this less ...
definitive, but nothing came, so we ran through bridge-rumors,
and soon we were hardly listening, waiting
for our own next word, and laughing at our gabble. Pequita
told us what the priest had said
about the drilling; you spoke of Pequita’s
First Communion, and none of us could stop
finding striking things to say. Next day you came over
to see my plants, and I came back for soup-supper, looking up
at my windows, which in the easy half-yellow light
of autumn looked oddly beckoning. As we ate,
you leaned forward, with a sudden rogue’s smile,
and mockingly proposed that we three walk across the bridge,
“There’s a path up there. If the bridge
is bad, we’ll tell off the Mayor—” (In what spirit, I wondered,
had you listened to our committee?) And when I got home
I looked down, and through your sheer curtains saw you
cleaning up, and Pequita, at the table, reading.   IV 
But next week, instead of the plank stair
that zigzags up the anchorage-side, we wandered
the riverside shipping alleys. From below, we could see
overhead the under-arch of the bridge, and feel
the resonant top-thrum of westbound
subways and trucks. Then the riverside—I loved
this part. A sort of post-industrial fenworld, with tiny
terrace houses, big dredger-parts laid aside
from the drillings, and abandoned wreckers’ lots
filled with sea-floor light and trembling, long-awned
panicles of switchgrass. Its timelessness
soothed me—though ephemeral. Even that day, one freshly
tuckpointed facade, and a pair of brandnew bronze
Edwardian mermaid doorknockers. I could see
our quarter five years from now, say—the withering
discount chains, tentative boutiques,
and mother and daughter figuring, to the upscale
“pioneers,” as neighborhood indigenes, living on
with strange literalness among them, supplying
their just-permissible quantum of urban grit. 
You were ahead, and Pequita trailed us, rattling weed stalks
with a stray lath. As we progressed in and out
of the endspan’s slatted shadows, you turned
and called me into a side-lot—sunken concrete, flask-
green puddles, to a broken-off building wall. It had been
interior, once—rows of soiled roomsized
plaster squares trailing sawn pipes, with one high trembling
toilet, like a pearl. In a lower square, fringed
with ailanthus and barbs of gang graffiti,
was a mural. Muy latino: the mountain
dreaming the city: a terrace cafe with palm trees
and a dancer shawled in black lace, with inward-angled
castanets. And you lifted yourself on tiptoe,
Pilar, to touch the lace, as you might have grazed
Pequita’s cheek. I felt a pang, as if I already needed you
sturdy inside your sturdy body, not this gesture
as if, exiled within, you reached out— We stepped
back, museum-wise, to contemplate, and you said:
“Luz likes to say I’m some mountain-woman, but when
my mother died, I lived with my aunt in the City—I only
went back when I married.” I told her I’d lived
in this city, with a stepmother, who’d divorced my uncle
to marry my father; and beat me. “A stepmother’s
a curse of God,” you said gently. And on the walk back,
pointed out more wall palms, beaches, until New York
seemed a dot in a belt of capitals
high on the globe: world-cities, packed
with immigrants, refugees, Gastarbeiter: a snowy
latitude suffused with tropical nostalgia.   V 
We were a threesome. Coffee, suppers, TV,
Pequita at my computer—you’d asked me to teach her—
or sleeping on my sofa, one bad month
they moved you to night shift. Yet only that summer,
I’d worked in my window like a scholar
in a lamplit bay, the night filled with myriad noises,
like Roman Juvenal, to whose ears “came ever
the sounds of buildings collapsing.” Across, the two
tenement-faces, florid, all bucrania, meanders, dusky trails
of fire-escape bedding. And everything underlit
by the sinister, slow-stopping car lights of our street. 
But now it was the dailiness of two
from another hemisphere. Through snow-fissures, winds fluting
on railings and building-flaws, Pilar in her low frame
paced with armfuls of laundry, washed
in the sink and hung to dry everywhere. The thousand
stratagems of those who simply must not spend;
and the tiny mother-decisions: though you preferred
periphery, housekeeping around her,
you’d make yourself interrupt her, to mop
behind your sweeping. And Pequita—I saw her wrap
you up on the sofa when you had flu, and bring you
orange juice, as they’d taught her in school, for she
loved you, she was the person who loved you—
I saw too, that of what I wanted the university
to be for me—a tiny model of the city
with its own rules and subsets: “Tell me
each day who I am”—you’d found your part
in Pequita; I followed the shape
of your day touching center as it funneled
into her hand and moving pencil-point.   VI 
For everything seemed natural to Pequita:
the Credo, her photocopied choir music
piled beside the tidy prie-dieu,
our neighborhood of syringe-filled gutters, drug-stoops and pimps,
her school’s turkey cutouts, metal detectors, backed-up toilets ...
Our human wilderness, half-urban, half-surreal
to her was a matter-of-fact Eden, like the picturesque ruins
and laughably rococo grottoes imagined 
by the seicento as the Golden Age.
—And I, I thought her whole world, it comes back—
touching, as if her child’s paradisial will were there
for my affectionate recreation, like our still faithfully,
occasionally, typed-up and dispatched
protests from the Ramp Committee to the Mayor. Slight effects
of perspective, tiny human gestures
giving point to the city’s vast, ironic beauty.   PART TWO  VII 
At a moment when no one was thinking
about her, Pequita awoke. Perhaps
she enjoyed the solitude, Pilar asleep,
me asleep across the street. She got up
and stood on the cheap oval bathroom rug
before the sink. At seven the drills started,
deeper-toned than ever before (they woke me)—
and part of your ceiling fell in; a beam
splintered, plummeting straight to the oval rug—
The person screaming over the phone
was Pilar. I thought it must be really
all right, or she’d be crying not screaming,
but when I’d called 911 and run over, Pequita
was barely alive. 
Then the hospital corridors,
me trying to close my winter coat
(the buttons were off) on my nightgown, you
on a bench, staring straight ahead.
When they said Pequita was
“gone,” you were utterly silent. I brought you
to my place (though our street was a tangle
of police lights and yellow tape), terrified
of your fixed inner focus, as if you had
a plan ... Next night I had Luz stay over,
I slept at her place; the third I was back. You,
thank God (I thought), were crying, and Luz
had set up the service. She propelled us downstairs
and to a tiny brick church I must often have passed
without seeing it, two blocks inland. 
Egg-blue inside, it was, with a little green
and gilt altar, dark Stations on the walls,
and the statue of the Virgin of Guadeloupe
placed oddly below the altar stairs, so that Pilar,
after the death-mass, could kneel
before her, praying straight into her face,
while I on a kneeler buried mine in my hands.
What would the mother live for now, the hotel, me, or Luz,
already writing more endless mad letters? Yet only these
had from the City real answers: they’d brace the drill site
with vibration-absorbing piers; and they wanted
her and her friend Mrs. Citrin to know
“that no one else had been more than lightly injured.”   VIII 
It was the end of winter, very dark. The building
managers, nervy, had moved you to the first floor
next door, till you found a new place (I knew
you weren’t looking). Each day I saw you
arrive from work, answer my call tersely,
then pull down your blinds. A shadow showed rarely,
flattened, shapeless; you lay on your sofa a lot.
“Thanks Anne—I’m better without company,” or
“please understand.” But often, later
in the evening, you’d come down the stairs
and turn inland. Then, one morning as I was passing
with early groceries, you were leaving the parish hall
in your black winter coat, heavily scarved,
and we paused. Approvingly, you tapped one glove
on my armload—you’d told me to cook more, dictated
recipes. I asked if this had been Pequita’s
choir-practice place; the sentence wavered,
but you replied with grim joy,
“She’s not practicing now.” It took me a minute.
Pequita was singing, this moment, in the Presence. 
Still what you felt most (it was in your face)
was absence, absence, but from something bitter
in your eyes, that seemed small and round with the cold, I felt
your desire to exclude me and our old collusive ironies.
What were such luxuries now, ironies, Anglo friends;
and I thought you hated my mind
that remembered the brownpapered books,
the orange juice. I reached to touch your arm—to get past
this, but no, you had to get home:
“I fasted for communion”; and your eyes
swerved away. All my laughable,
my lovely, delusional studies, that I’d seen you
sort through for Pequita, were now an affront. And yet
I felt you moving behind your own mind, as if
with something held in reserve ...   IX 
But then you stopped answering the phone, went
less often to church. What I thought
was that you were angry (certainly I was). Perhaps
I thought you needed to talk, and I’d visit you
in Manhattan. So one morning in March,
in the black coat I’d got for the funeral, I walked east
from the forty-second street Lexington stop
to the three-story, fairy-lit jungle atrium
of the Tricontinental, and went to the seventh floor,
where you started. There was a cart in the hall, 
a gleaming chrome maid’s cart half-projecting
from a bedroom. On its sides were rows
of glasses with lace sani-bonnets, gold-
stamped mini-soaps and deodorants. It moved out,
and you stood in the door with a sheet-load, looking fat
in a starchy pink uniform monogrammed PILAR. When you saw me, you dropped the sheets
and in pain, pressed both palms to your cheeks,
and looked at me looking at you. When
I started sobbing, you took my shoulder and backed me
to the elevator. Pressed the button, stepped back,
and then, to my surprise, gave me a sudden hug
before pushing me in.   X 
It had been always this half-connected
and tenuous, our friendship. What light on my own
isolation and need, that I hadn’t known.
But you actually called me, that week, to propose
our old joke, a bridge walk—maybe Saturday?
Your voice in my ears sounded wobbly
with tension, held-backness, so I got in first:
a friend had wound up her doctorate and left me
a minute Village studio starting June ... After that
I could listen, somber, as you poured out
your need to leave, Luz’s cousin, the possible
hotel job “right in LA.” You added “Anne,” and broke off.
“Well, I’ll tell you that later. Look, it may
snow on Saturday, OK?” “I don’t care.” And before 
you hung up, I’d resigned you,
given you up. We’d part, on my side
in anger, on yours in oblivion. I met you
at the foot of the anchorage stair
(not the eastern approach, with its easy grade
near the ramp site). We climbed through the snow,
slowly, pausing at landings for different
views of our old alley world. Like a museum
of disused urban functions—we noted a bricked-over
backyard privy arch, and from higher, roof-huts, inkily distinct,
of old-style tenement dumbwaiters. The whole scene
thrown out of drawing by one of those giant
NYC cable-spools, charred at the bottom
where some homeless had tried to burn it. 
The moist snow was sweeping
through the cable tower when we clambered
onto the path beneath it. As we moved, hunched slightly,
onto the mainspan, the whole city abruptly
whited-out to a monochrome geometry
of vertical and stooping gray lines. I thought
how Pequita would have loved it, and caught
her mother’s eye. We went on cautiously, soon
pausing to stamp our boots and look over the rail
at the traffic lanes below us. “Anne, what
I started to say before—this is it: I’m sorry
I didn’t talk to you—you understand?” “Of course,”
I lied aimlessly. But you, glancing sideways,
“But I’m really sorry ...” “No, really ...” You shook
your head slightly, then took my arm. “Okay then—
what’s this thing?” pointing a snowy boot
at a bolt as high as our knees, with a rusted-on octagonal
nut: “It’s just a bolt.” You tapped your glove on a strut—
“strut,” I provided. And you said, pompously, in Luz’ very
intonations (in what spirit had you
listened?)—“The tolerances just aren’t there.” 
Then, feeling easier, we started naming everything—
spikes, spun-wire vertical cables: English,
Spanish, and then I heard you speak Quiché (words once
for vines, for split trunks
over gorges?) But everything on the bridge was
shabby, neglected-looking; and you said
soberly: “If anyone was supposed
to look after this bridge, he’s forgot all about it.”
We didn’t link arms again, but started back, pausing
to throw a few loose snowballs
on the Manhattan traffic below us. We’d go
our separate ways—I’d go on delaying, skirting
around my burnt-out places; you’d go
where you could, forget what you could—
some Job-like relinquishment of inquiry
or thought; organisms tend to persist ... When
we got down to the massive base
of the anchorage, we managed a hug
that took in our past, at least: one embrace
of two black winter coats in the snow.


^^EOP^^

We are born with dreams in our hearts,
looking for better days ahead.
At the gates we are given new papers,
our old clothes are taken
and we are given overalls like mechanics wear.
We are given shots and doctors ask questions.
Then we gather in another room
where counselors orient us to the new land
we will now live in. We take tests.
Some of us were craftsmen in the old world,
good with our hands and proud of our work.
Others were good with their heads.
They used common sense like scholars
use glasses and books to reach the world.
But most of us didn’t finish high school. 
The old men who have lived here stare at us,
from deep disturbed eyes, sulking, retreated.
We pass them as they stand around idle,
leaning on shovels and rakes or against walls.
Our expectations are high: in the old world,
they talked about rehabilitation,
about being able to finish school,
and learning an extra good trade.
But right away we are sent to work as dishwashers,
to work in fields for three cents an hour.
The administration says this is temporary
So we go about our business, blacks with blacks,
poor whites with poor whites,
chicanos and indians by themselves.
The administration says this is right,
no mixing of cultures, let them stay apart,
like in the old neighborhoods we came from. 
We came here to get away from false promises,
from dictators in our neighborhoods,
who wore blue suits and broke our doors down
when they wanted, arrested us when they felt like,
swinging clubs and shooting guns as they pleased.
But it’s no different here. It’s all concentrated.
The doctors don’t care, our bodies decay,
our minds deteriorate, we learn nothing of value.
Our lives don’t get better, we go down quick. 
My cell is crisscrossed with laundry lines,
my T-shirts, boxer shorts, socks and pants are drying.
Just like it used to be in my neighborhood:
from all the tenements laundry hung window to window.
Across the way Joey is sticking his hands
through the bars to hand Felipé a cigarette,
men are hollering back and forth cell to cell,
saying their sinks don’t work,
or somebody downstairs hollers angrily
about a toilet overflowing,
or that the heaters don’t work. 
I ask Coyote next door to shoot me over
a little more soap to finish my laundry.
I look down and see new immigrants coming in,
mattresses rolled up and on their shoulders,
new haircuts and brogan boots,
looking around, each with a dream in their heart,
thinking they’ll get a chance to change their lives. 
But in the end, some will just sit around
talking about how good the old world was.
Some of the younger ones will become gangsters.
Some will die and others will go on living
without a soul, a future, or a reason to live.
Some will make it out of here with hate in their eyes,
but so very few make it out of here as human
as they came in, they leave wondering what good they are now
as they look at their hands so long away from their tools,
as they look at themselves, so long gone from their families,
so long gone from life itself, so many things have changed.


^^EOP^^

I speak this poem now with grave and level voice   
In praise of autumn, of the far-horn-winding fall. 
I praise the flower-barren fields, the clouds, the tall   
Unanswering branches where the wind makes sullen noise. 
I praise the fall: it is the human season.
                                                                  Now
No more the foreign sun does meddle at our earth,   
Enforce the green and bring the fallow land to birth,   
Nor winter yet weigh all with silence the pine bough, 
But now in autumn with the black and outcast crows   
Share we the spacious world: the whispering year is gone:   
There is more room to live now: the once secret dawn   
Comes late by daylight and the dark unguarded goes. 
Between the mutinous brave burning of the leaves   
And winter’s covering of our hearts with his deep snow   
We are alone: there are no evening birds: we know   
The naked moon: the tame stars circle at our eaves. 
It is the human season. On this sterile air
Do words outcarry breath: the sound goes on and on.   
I hear a dead man’s cry from autumn long since gone. 
I cry to you beyond upon this bitter air.


^^EOP^^

The noise throws down
twin shadows, hunting shadows
on a black joy ride. 
They roar up the silver vein of the river
and out over the stony peaks, 
which have been shrunken to a luminous
green musculature on the screens.
Who are the pilots, too high to see 
the splayed hearts of deer tracks 
under the apple trees, or smell
the cider in the fallen fruit? 
Who are the vandals that ransack
the wilderness of clouds? 
Below them, a thin froth of waterfall
spills from a rock face.
They see its sudden wreckage, 
its yielding gouts, 
and the wind tear into the papery
leaves of the poplars, roughing them up 
so the undersides show—
a glimpse of paleness
like a glimpse of underwear. 
The pilots are young men,
and still immortal. 
Already in the cold
quadrants of their hearts
they imagine the whole world 
flowering beneath them. It feels
like love, like being with a woman
who flowers beneath them, 
so that they wonder
how it would feel to go on
riding the young green world that way, 
to a climax of spectral light.


^^EOP^^

Naked she lay, clasped in my longing arms, I filled with love, and she all over charms; Both equally inspired with eager fire, Melting through kindness, flaming in desire. With arms, legs, lips close clinging to embrace, She clips me to her breast, and sucks me to her face. Her nimble tongue, love’s lesser lightning, played Within my mouth, and to my thoughts conveyed Swift orders that I should prepare to throw The all-dissolving thunderbolt below. My fluttering soul, sprung with the pointed kiss, Hangs hovering o’er her balmy brinks of bliss. But whilst her busy hand would guide that part Which should convey my soul up to her heart, In liquid raptures I dissolve all o’er, Melt into sperm, and spend at every pore. A touch from any part of her had done ’t: Her hand, her foot, her very look's a cunt.    Smiling, she chides in a kind murmuring noise, And from her body wipes the clammy joys, When, with a thousand kisses wandering o’er My panting bosom, “Is there then no more?” She cries. “All this to love and rapture’s due; Must we not pay a debt to pleasure too?”     But I, the most forlorn, lost man alive, To show my wished obedience vainly strive: I sigh, alas! and kiss, but cannot swive. Eager desires confound my first intent, Succeeding shame does more success prevent, And rage at last confirms me impotent. Ev’n her fair hand, which might bid heat return To frozen age, and make cold hermits burn, Applied to my dear cinder, warms no more Than fire to ashes could past flames restore. Trembling, confused, despairing, limber, dry, A wishing, weak, unmoving lump I lie. This dart of love, whose piercing point, oft tried, With virgin blood ten thousand maids has dyed, Which nature still directed with such art That it through every cunt reached every heart— Stiffly resolved, ’twould carelessly invade Woman or man, nor ought its fury stayed: Where’er it pierced, a cunt it found or made— Now languid lies in this unhappy hour, Shrunk up and sapless like a withered flower.     Thou treacherous, base deserter of my flame, False to my passion, fatal to my fame, Through what mistaken magic dost thou prove So true to lewdness, so untrue to love? What oyster-cinder-beggar-common whore Didst thou e’er fail in all thy life before? When vice, disease, and scandal lead the way, With what officious haste doest thou obey! Like a rude, roaring hector in the streets Who scuffles, cuffs, and justles all he meets, But if his king or country claim his aid, The rakehell villain shrinks and hides his head; Ev’n so thy brutal valor is displayed, Breaks every stew, does each small whore invade, But when great Love the onset does command, Base recreant to thy prince, thou dar’st not stand. Worst part of me, and henceforth hated most, Through all the town a common fucking post, On whom each whore relieves her tingling cunt As hogs on gates do rub themselves and grunt, Mayst thou to ravenous chancres be a prey, Or in consuming weepings waste away; May strangury and stone thy days attend; May’st thou never piss, who didst refuse to spend When all my joys did on false thee depend.    And may ten thousand abler pricks agree    To do the wronged Corinna right for thee.

To Robert Hass and in Memory of Elliot Gilbert



Slow dulcimer, gavotte and bow, in autumn,   
Bashō and his friends go out to view the moon;   
In summer, gasoline rainbow in the gutter, 
The secret courtesy that courses like ichor   
Through the old form of the rude, full-scale joke,   
Impossible to tell in writing. “Bashō” 
He named himself, “Banana Tree”: banana   
After the plant some grateful students gave him,   
Maybe in appreciation of his guidance 
Threading a long night through the rules and channels   
Of their collaborative linking-poem   
Scored in their teacher’s heart: live, rigid, fluid 
Like passages etched in a microscopic circuit.   
Elliot had in his memory so many jokes
They seemed to breed like microbes in a culture 
Inside his brain, one so much making another   
It was impossible to tell them all:   
In the court-culture of jokes, a top banana. 
Imagine a court of one: the queen a young mother,   
Unhappy, alone all day with her firstborn child   
And her new baby in a squalid apartment 
Of too few rooms, a different race from her neighbors.   
She tells the child she’s going to kill herself.   
She broods, she rages. Hoping to distract her, 
The child cuts capers, he sings, he does imitations   
Of different people in the building, he jokes,   
He feels if he keeps her alive until the father    
Gets home from work, they’ll be okay till morning.   
It’s laughter versus the bedroom and the pills.   
What is he in his efforts but a courtier? 
Impossible to tell his whole delusion.
In the first months when I had moved back East   
From California and had to leave a message 
On Bob’s machine, I used to make a habit
Of telling the tape a joke; and part-way through,   
I would pretend that I forgot the punchline, 
Or make believe that I was interrupted—
As though he’d be so eager to hear the end   
He‘d have to call me back. The joke was Elliot’s, 
More often than not. The doctors made the blunder   
That killed him some time later that same year.   
One day when I got home I found a message 
On my machine from Bob. He had a story   
About two rabbis, one of them tall, one short,   
One day while walking along the street together 
They see the corpse of a Chinese man before them,   
And Bob said, sorry, he forgot the rest.   
Of course he thought that his joke was a dummy, 
Impossible to tell—a dead-end challenge.   
But here it is, as Elliot told it to me:
The dead man’s widow came to the rabbis weeping, 
Begging them, if they could, to resurrect him.   
Shocked, the tall rabbi said absolutely not.   
But the short rabbi told her to bring the body 
Into the study house, and ordered the shutters   
Closed so the room was night-dark. Then he prayed   
Over the body, chanting a secret blessing 
Out of Kabala. “Arise and breathe,” he shouted;   
But nothing happened. The body lay still. So then   
The little rabbi called for hundreds of candles 
And danced around the body, chanting and praying   
In Hebrew, then Yiddish, then Aramaic. He prayed   
In Turkish and Egyptian and Old Galician 
For nearly three hours, leaping about the coffin   
In the candlelight so that his tiny black shoes   
Seemed not to touch the floor. With one last prayer 
Sobbed in the Spanish of before the Inquisition
He stopped, exhausted, and looked in the dead man’s face.   
Panting, he raised both arms in a mystic gesture 
And said, “Arise and breathe!” And still the body
Lay as before. Impossible to tell
In words how Elliot’s eyebrows flailed and snorted 
Like shaggy mammoths as—the Chinese widow   
Granting permission—the little rabbi sang   
The blessing for performing a circumcision 
And removed the dead man’s foreskin, chanting blessings   
In Finnish and Swahili, and bathed the corpse   
From head to foot, and with a final prayer 
In Babylonian, gasping with exhaustion,
He seized the dead man’s head and kissed the lips   
And dropped it again and leaping back commanded, 
“Arise and breathe!” The corpse lay still as ever.   
At this, as when Bashō’s disciples wind   
Along the curving spine that links the renga 
Across the different voices, each one adding   
A transformation according to the rules   
Of stasis and repetition, all in order 
And yet impossible to tell beforehand,   
Elliot changes for the punchline: the wee   
Rabbi, still panting, like a startled boxer, 
Looks at the dead one, then up at all those watching,   
A kind of Mel Brooks gesture: “Hoo boy!” he says,   
“Now that’s what I call really dead.” O mortal 
Powers and princes of earth, and you immortal   
Lords of the underground and afterlife,   
Jehovah, Raa, Bol-Morah, Hecate, Pluto, 
What has a brilliant, living soul to do with   
Your harps and fires and boats, your bric-a-brac   
And troughs of smoking blood? Provincial stinkers, 
Our languages don’t touch you, you’re like that mother   
Whose small child entertained her to beg her life.   
Possibly he grew up to be the tall rabbi, 
The one who washed his hands of all those capers   
Right at the outset. Or maybe he became   
The author of these lines, a one-man renga 
The one for whom it seems to be impossible   
To tell a story straight. It was a routine   
Procedure. When it was finished the physicians 
Told Sandra and the kids it had succeeded,
But Elliot wouldn’t wake up for maybe an hour,   
They should go eat. The two of them loved to bicker 
In a way that on his side went back to Yiddish,   
On Sandra’s to some Sicilian dialect.   
He used to scold her endlessly for smoking. 
When she got back from dinner with their children   
The doctors had to tell them about the mistake.   
Oh swirling petals, falling leaves! The movement 
Of linking renga coursing from moment to moment   
Is meaning, Bob says in his Haiku book.   
Oh swirling petals, all living things are contingent,  Falling leaves, and transient, and they suffer.   
But the Universal is the goal of jokes,   
Especially certain ethnic jokes, which taper 
Down through the swirling funnel of tongues and gestures   
Toward their preposterous Ithaca. There’s one   
A journalist told me. He heard it while a hero 
Of the South African freedom movement was speaking   
To elderly Jews. The speaker’s own right arm   
Had been blown off by right-wing letter-bombers. 
He told his listeners they had to cast their ballots   
For the ANC—a group the old Jews feared   
As “in with the Arabs.” But they started weeping 
As the old one-armed fighter told them their country   
Needed them to vote for what was right, their vote   
Could make a country their children could return to 
From London and Chicago. The moved old people   
Applauded wildly, and the speaker’s friend   
Whispered to the journalist, “It’s the Belgian Army 
Joke come to life.” I wish that I could tell it   
To Elliot. In the Belgian Army, the feud
Between the Flemings and Walloons grew vicious, 
So out of hand the army could barely function.   
Finally one commander assembled his men   
In one great room, to deal with things directly. 
They stood before him at attention. “All Flemings,”   
He ordered, “to the left wall.” Half the men
Clustered to the left. “Now all Walloons,” he ordered, 
“Move to the right.” An equal number crowded   
Against the right wall. Only one man remained
At attention in the middle: “What are you, soldier?” 
Saluting, the man said, “Sir, I am a Belgian.”
“Why, that’s astonishing, Corporal—what’s your name?”   
Saluting again, “Rabinowitz,” he answered: 
A joke that seems at first to be a story   
About the Jews. But as the renga describes   
Religious meaning by moving in drifting petals 
And brittle leaves that touch and die and suffer   
The changing winds that riffle the gutter swirl,   
So in the joke, just under the raucous music 
Of Fleming, Jew, Walloon, a courtly allegiance   
Moves to the dulcimer, gavotte and bow,   
Over the banana tree the moon in autumn— 
Allegiance to a state impossible to tell.

To Lady Winchelsea, Occasioned by four Satirical Verses on Women Wits,  In The Rape of the Lock 



In vain you boast poetic names of yore, And cite those Sapphos we admire no more: Fate doomed the fall of every female wit; But doomed it then, when first Ardelia writ. Of all examples by the world confessed, I knew Ardelia could not quote the best; Who, like her mistress on Britannia’s throne, Fights and subdues in quarrels not her own. To write their praise you but in vain essay; Even while you write, you take that praise away. Light to the stars the sun does thus restore, But shines himself till they are seen no more.

Fire isn’t allowed, for the sake of the books.
The lean monk-copyist who scribes the books is slate-blue at his fingertips
this steely late-November day in the year 1000. Brother Ambrosio
huffs some perfunctory warmth on his stiffening hands,
then bends again to his goat’s-horn of ink. For every line,
he believes, he’s forgiven a sin. And now he’s at his heavy
uncial letters, and will be for nine hours more,
until a slab of bread and a beet relieve his transcriptual ardor.
What he copies?—psalter, missal, hagiography:
the predetermined and sanctioned community passions
of a religious culture. Nothing like the twentieth century’s
prevalent kneejerk “self-expression.” Nothing like the priest, 
excuse me: former priest, and former nun, on daytime talk TV,
who live, she tells us, in a “trinity of love” with the former
creator-of-tourist-ashtrays-out-of-catfish-heads. This is,
she insists, the final and jubilant stage of a lifelong “quest
to feel belongingness” initiated thirty years before
by parents skittering cross-country with the military: they
were wholly rootless, and so she grew up “unable to commit.” The following day,
a man confesses to pedophilia because of a lesbian aunt.
A woman says she robbed the Sack-N-Save of $13.42
“because of what they’re dumping in the water supply, it makes me
go all freaky.” Steve was bounced out from The Chicken Shack
“because I’m Scandinavian.” The culture 
of blame is so completely exterior in its search for cause,
some days I wake to think I’ll find most people laboring
under the weight of sci-fi-style mind parasites, like fleshy turbans
spewing in, and feeding off, their brain blood. This (by “this”
I mean of course a recognition of the magic of objective correlative
boppin’ about in the spotlight) is, to some length,
understandable: you can’t beat the miniscule carry-along
convenience of a silicon chip invisibly set in something,
BUT for sheer persuasive visual power, that can’t touch
a 1940s generating plant, its giant Alcatrazian shape
against the sky, and the enormous wrestling electrical crackles
snaking its rooftop pylon. In the scriptorium, even 
—such an isolated unit of human endeavor, its limited range
of reactions surely is pure—when Brother Ambrosio
nods off, sleepy in his long day’s long eighth hour
of thickly nibbed and careful letters, he knows
it’s imps in league with Satan that keep pulling down his eyelids.
If in scratching his flea-measled thigh he spills
a hand’s-expanse of ink across the vellum page, the fleas
are tiny devils on a guerilla mission from Hell.
And once a devilkin took lodging in his belly, and there
created “rumbling noises like a toad, and which, for hours,
spoiled the concentration of all of the other Brothers.”
We find parchment scraps with appropriate exorcisms: 
“Away! you flaming sow, you poisoned udder,
you arse of the arch-fiend, shit-fly, stinking he-goat,
out out out, away, back into thine infernal kitchen,
you bestial puke!” We also find
those charming marginal doodles (sprigs in flower,
unicorns, seemingly every songbird in Creation): such
diminutive external bodies given to the longings of these
cooped-up men. And when they came to drag my friend Jess
screaming to the ward, because he was beating his head
on the lawyer’s steps, it was clear to us all that the chemicals
in his mind had turned against him. It was clear to Jess
that he was being hunted like prey by hounds from the moon.

You can shuffle and scuffle and scold,
   You can rattle the knockers and knobs,
Or batter the doorsteps with buckets of gold
   Till the Deputy-Governor sobs.
You can sneak up a suitable plank
   In a frantic endeavor to see—
But what do they do in the Commonwealth Bank
   When the Big Door bangs at Three? 
Listen in the cellars, listen in the vaults,
Can’t you hear the tellers turning somersaults?
Can’t you hear the spectres of inspectors and directors
Dancing with the phantoms in a Dead Man’s Waltz?
Some are ghosts of nabobs, poverty and stray bobs,
Midas and his mistress, Mammon and his wife;
Other ones are sentries, guarding double entries,
Long-forgotten, double-dealing, troubled double-life.
Down among the pass-books, money lent and spent,
Down among the forests of the Four Per Cent.,
Where the ledgers meet and moulder, and the overdrafts grow older,
And the phantoms shrug a shoulder when you ask ’em for the rent. 
They are bogies of Grandfather’s cheques,
   They are spectres of buried accounts,
They are crinoline sweethearts with pearls on their necks,
   Demanding enormous amounts.
They are payment for suppers and flowers,
   For diamonds to banish a tear,
For sweet, pretty ladies in opulent hours . . .
   And tombstones . . . and bailiffs . . . and beer . . . 
Down in the bowels of the bank, the ledgers lie rank upon rank,
The debts of the ages come out of their pages,
The bones of old loans creak and clank—
Oh, if you could peep through the door
To day at a Quarter Past Four,
You’d find all the ghosts at their usual posts,
And you wouldn’t sign cheques any more!

In a dark time, the eye begins to see,
I meet my shadow in the deepening shade;   
I hear my echo in the echoing wood—
A lord of nature weeping to a tree.
I live between the heron and the wren,   
Beasts of the hill and serpents of the den. 
What’s madness but nobility of soul
At odds with circumstance? The day’s on fire!   
I know the purity of pure despair,
My shadow pinned against a sweating wall.   
That place among the rocks—is it a cave,   
Or winding path? The edge is what I have. 
A steady storm of correspondences!
A night flowing with birds, a ragged moon,   
And in broad day the midnight come again!   
A man goes far to find out what he is—
Death of the self in a long, tearless night,   
All natural shapes blazing unnatural light. 
Dark, dark my light, and darker my desire.   
My soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly,   
Keeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is I?
A fallen man, I climb out of my fear.   
The mind enters itself, and God the mind,   
And one is One, free in the tearing wind.

In a landscape of having to repeat.
Noticing that she does, that he does and so on.
The underlying cause is as absent as rain.
Yet one remembers rain even in its absence and an attendant quiet.   
If illusion descends or the very word you’ve been looking for.
He remembers looking at the photograph,
green and gray squares, undefined.
How perfectly ordinary someone says looking at the same thing or   
I’d like to get to the bottom of that one.
When it is raining it is raining for all time and then it isn’t
and when she looked at him, as he remembers it, the landscape moved closer   
than ever and she did and now he can hardly remember what it was like.

Hans Richter



What if the moon was essence of quinine
And high heels were a time of day
When certain birds bled
The chauffeur is telling the cook
The antler would pry into ice floes
Swim with a lamp
And we’d be shivering in a ditch
Biting through a black wing
There would be boats
There would be a dream country
The great quiet humming of the soul at night
The only sound is a shovel
Clearing a place for a mailbox

The image that haunts me is not beautiful.
I do not think it will open into a field
of wildflowers; I doubt that it will take
wing suddenly, startling us into admiration. 
It is one of those brutish facts of life,
the awkward nakedness of the memory when
it takes off its clothes and crawls
between the top and bottom sheet. Or rather, 
It is my mother’s memory that I carry,
pressed into my own: how at her grandfather’s
funeral, his daughter—my mother’s mother—
stood at an open door and cried, and then 
The blood ran down her legs, gushing from
the womb where thirteen children had nestled,
and now, at once horrified and at ease with her
body’s impropriety, they gathered all around. 
This was the grandmother who lost three of those
thirteen, who hung a million baskets of wash,
who peeled a million potatoes, and splattered
her arms with the grease of constant cooking. 
This was my grandmother who kept chickens,
who left her voice in the throats of all my aunts,
and was struck down in the cellar, legs twisted
beneath the fall and half her face stiffened. 
Helpless until they found her, the jar
of canned fruit smashed on the cement.
And then at her funeral, I saw my mother’s
tears, gliding ahead of me in a black limousine,
a procession not beautiful but haunting.

Pale, then enkindled,
light
advancing,
emblazoning
summits of palm and pine, 
the dew
lingering,
scripture of
scintillas. 
Soon the roar
of mowers
cropping the already short
grass of lawns, 
men with long-nozzled
cylinders of pesticide
poking at weeds,
at moss in cracks of cement, 
and louder roar
of helicopters off to spray
vineyards where braceros try
to hold their breath, 
and in the distance, bulldozers, excavators,
babel of destructive construction. 
Banded by deep
oakshadow, airy
shadow of eucalyptus, 
miner’s lettuce,
tender, untasted,
and other grass, unmown,
luxuriant,
no green more brilliant. 
Fragile paradise. 
         .   .   .   . 
At day’s end the whole sky,
vast, unstinting, flooded with transparent
mauve,
tint of wisteria,
cloudless
over the malls, the industrial parks,
the homes with the lights going on,
the homeless arranging their bundles. 
         .   .   .   . 
Who can utter
the poignance of all that is constantly
threatened, invaded, expended 
and constantly
nevertheless
persists in beauty, 
tranquil as this young moon
just risen and slowly
drinking light   
from the vanished sun. 
Who can utter
the praise of such generosity
or the shame?

California night. The Devil’s wind,   
the Santa Ana, blows in from the east,   
raging through the canyon like a drunk   
screaming in a bar.
                            The air tastes like
a stubbed-out cigarette. But why complain?   
The weather’s fine as long as you don’t breathe.   
Just lean back on the sweat-stained furniture,   
lights turned out, windows shut against the storm,   
and count your blessings.
                                     Another sleepless night,
when every wrinkle in the bedsheet scratches   
like a dry razor on a sunburned cheek,   
when even ten-year whiskey tastes like sand,   
and quiet women in the kitchen run   
their fingers on the edges of a knife
and eye their husbands’ necks. I wish them luck. 
Tonight it seems that if I took the coins
out of my pocket and tossed them in the air   
they’d stay a moment glistening like a net   
slowly falling through dark water.
                                                   I remember
the headlights of the cars parked on the beach,   
the narrow beams dissolving on the dark   
surface of the lake, voices arguing
about the forms, the crackling radio,   
the sheeted body lying on the sand,
the trawling net still damp beside it. No,
she wasn’t beautiful—but at that age
when youth itself becomes a kind of beauty—
“Taking good care of your clients, Marlowe?” 
Relentlessly the wind blows on. Next door   
catching a scent, the dogs begin to howl.   
Lean, furious, raw-eyed from the storm,   
packs of coyotes come down from the hills   
where there is nothing left to hunt.

In the rheumatic heat of July,   
when Public Enemy blared   
on the blasters 
in a time when arbitrage   
and foreign policy
were bureaus of each other, 
I made a wrong turn off Broadway   
and wound up at St. John the Divine 
where I sat in the hot dark   
until the traffic died.  
* 
And a voice comes over
some columns to the breeze of the Golden Horn   
over the cypress groves 
and flowing bougainvillea
where the bright blue weather and the old   
seawalls come together, 
where crates of cardamom   
and musk are piled and   
the cattle hang in blood 
above the brass,   
where the grain boats   
stink and red pleasure 
barges drift where Jason   
sailed for his fleece—
a voice comes out of the dead water. 
In great Sophia
light pours in rosy bars
on the porphyry and the green marble 
till the air blooms,
and a chrysalis of lit crosses   
makes circles in the air. 
Light falls through the lunettes   
like arrows of gold that could’ve   
sneaked up the Virgin’s dress. 
Had the Holy Ghost flitted in
it would’ve been lost in the glare 
and the kiss of peace
Justinian blew from the ambo.  
* 
Incantations flutter and rhyme   
in the apse like wings   
in a cloud of incense 
thinning on the gold-leafed
vaults where the tongue’s vibration   
lingers in the upper air, 
and rises and rises as if the dome could open   
to a half-hemisphere of heaven
where in the translucent glitter of the Kingdom 
the Saints are poised in gracious robes   
with their thousand-year-frozen faces—
the one truth glued on the grout of their lips.  
2 
I sit with the incense of memory,   
and a bath of dark pours   
from the vaults above the pew 
Outside, boutiques of money collide   
with the street fires in Harlem, whole   
skyscrapers are levitated by arbitrage, 
and the only inside takeover I can negotiate
is myself in this pew with my herringbone jacket   
which I should chuck in the Salvation Army bin 
down the block, so I could join the line of choir-
boys in their last innocent ritual   
as they stand before the mounted sermon sign 
“he shall bring forth judgment unto truth”
(Isaiah 42:3). The Puritans because
they believed God’s altar needs not their polish 
lifted the boulder of truth higher than the glittering   
face of the Nazarene once leaded in glass. 
For the spirit they swallowed stones
and shattered all the panes. But beneath the lavender   
arch of a Canon Table in an old Gospel 
I once tasted the consubstantial dewdrop   
in the faded color of a peacock’s wing. 
So while a stone sinks to the bottom of my   
river, a peacock’s wing floats by the shore. 
Who tells it like it is: Isaiah or Procopius?     
3 
I started walking backward   
down the aisle 
when I heard and thought I   
saw in the strange fenestration   
of that light— 
a voice,
first incoherent, and then sharp   
as if it were in my ear  There is no reign that executes   
justice and judgment;   
is that why you whine?

You may hear that your heartbeat is uneven
and let new tension climb around your shoulders,
thinking you've found the trick for going mad.
But try to keep a grip on where you are. 
Remember: all around you is pure city;
try to stay alert. On the wide streets,
so empty late at night, streaking in glass,
the color of an alley, or the fall 
of a sideways flicker from a neon sign
may utterly and briefly disconcert you—
but as you go, you'll find that noise is worse.
Prepare for noise. But never scream. Even tensing 
ears too far in advance can sharpen sirens,
and as for horns. ... When you're back to
your normal rhythm after such encounters, 
just try to stay alert. You'll never know
exactly who is coming up behind you,
but the sudden movement of pedestrians
will finally, of course, be what disarms you.

In Golden Gate Park that day
                           a man and his wife were coming along   
         thru the enormous meadow
                           which was the meadow of the world   
He was wearing green suspenders
                              and carrying an old beat-up flute
                                                                        in one hand   
      while his wife had a bunch of grapes
                                  which she kept handing out
                                                                         individually   
                                                      to various squirrels
                                                                           as if each   
                                                             were a little joke 
      And then the two of them came on
                                                thru the enormous meadow   
which was the meadow of the world
                                                 and then
            at a very still spot where the trees dreamed
         and seemed to have been waiting thru all time
                                                                            for them   
             they sat down together on the grass
                                              without looking at each other   
                and ate oranges
                                    without looking at each other
                                                            and put the peels   
             in a basket which they seemed
                                       to have brought for that purpose   
                  without looking at each other 
      And then
                  he took his shirt and undershirt off   
       but kept his hat on
                                    sideways
                                                and without saying anything   
             fell asleep under it
                                           And his wife just sat there looking   
at the birds which flew about
   calling to each other
                           in the stilly air
      as if they were questioning existence
                   or trying to recall something forgotten 
But then finally
                   she too lay down flat
                                                and just lay there looking up   
                                                                               at nothing   
                        yet fingering the old flute
                                                                which nobody played
                            and finally looking over
                                                                at him
                  without any particular expression
                                                               except a certain awful look

In Goya’s greatest scenes we seem to see
                                           the people of the world   
       exactly at the moment when
             they first attained the title of
                                                             ‘suffering humanity’   
          They writhe upon the page
                                        in a veritable rage
                                                                of adversity   
          Heaped up
                     groaning with babies and bayonets
                                                       under cement skies   
            in an abstract landscape of blasted trees
                  bent statues bats wings and beaks
                               slippery gibbets
                  cadavers and carnivorous cocks
            and all the final hollering monsters
                  of the
                           ‘imagination of disaster’
            they are so bloody real
                                        it is as if they really still existed 
    And they do 
                  Only the landscape is changed 
They still are ranged along the roads   
          plagued by legionnaires
                     false windmills and demented roosters
They are the same people
                                     only further from home
      on freeways fifty lanes wide
                              on a concrete continent
                                        spaced with bland billboards   
                        illustrating imbecile illusions of happiness 
                       
                        The scene shows fewer tumbrils
                                                but more strung-out citizens
                                                                     in painted cars
                               and they have strange license plates   
                           and engines
                                           that devour America

In Heaven,Some little blades of grassStood before God.“What did you do?”Then all save one of the little bladesBegan eagerly to relateThe merits of their lives.This one stayed a small way behindAshamed.Presently God said:“And what did you do?”The little blade answered: “Oh, my lord,“Memory is bitter to me“For if I did good deeds“I know not of them.”Then God in all His splendorArose from His throne.“Oh, best little blade of grass,” He said.

Rigid Body (sings).



Gin a body meet a body
   Flyin’ through the air,Gin a body hit a body,
   Will it fly? and where?Ilka impact has its measure,
   Ne’er a ane hae I,Yet a’ the lads they measure me,
   Or, at least, they try.
Gin a body meet a body

   We do not always see.Ilka problem has its method

   But what the waur am I?

When snow like sheep lay in the fold
And winds went begging at each door,
And the far hills were blue with cold,
And a cold shroud lay on the moor, 
She kept the siege. And every day
We watched her brooding over death
Like a strong bird above its prey.
The room filled with the kettle’s breath. 
Damp curtains glued against the pane
Sealed time away. Her body froze
As if to freeze us all, and chain
Creation to a stunned repose. 
She died before the world could stir.
In March the ice unloosed the brook
And water ruffled the sun’s hair.
Dead cones upon the alder shook.

But the essential advantage for a poet is not, to have a beautiful world with which to deal: it is to be able to see beneath both beauty and ugliness; to see the boredom, and the horror, and the glory.
T. S. ELIOT



It was his story. It would always be his story.   
It followed him; it overtook him finally—
The boredom, and the horror, and the glory. 
Probably at the end he was not yet sorry,
Even as the boots were brutalizing him in the alley.   
It was his story. It would always be his story, 
Blown on a blue horn, full of sound and fury,   
But signifying, O signifying magnificently   
The boredom, and the horror, and the glory. 
I picture the snow as falling without hurry
To cover the cobbles and the toppled ashcans completely.   
It was his story. It would always be his story. 
Lately he had wandered between St. Mark’s Place and the Bowery,   
Already half a spirit, mumbling and muttering sadly.   
O the boredom, and the horror, and the glory. 
All done now. But I remember the fiery
Hypnotic eye and the raised voice blazing with poetry.   
It was his story and would always be his story—
The boredom, and the horror, and the glory.

Created purely from glass the saint stands,
Exposing his gifted quite empty hands
Like a conjurer about to begin,
A righteous man begging of righteous men.  
2 
In the sun lily-and-gold-coloured,
Filtering the cruder light, he has endured,
A feature for our regard; and will keep;
Of worldly purity the stained archetype.

The scummed pond twitches. The great holly-tree,
Emptied and shut, blows clear of wasting snow,
The common, puddled substance: beneath,
Like a revealed mineral, a new earth.

Still sits the school-house by the road,    A ragged beggar sleeping; Around it still the sumachs grow,    And blackberry-vines are creeping.  Within, the master’s desk is seen,    Deep scarred by raps official; The warping floor, the battered seats,    The jack-knife’s carved initial;  The charcoal frescos on its wall;    Its door’s worn sill, betraying The feet that, creeping slow to school,    Went storming out to playing!  Long years ago a winter sun    Shone over it at setting; Lit up its western window-panes,    And low eaves’ icy fretting.  It touched the tangled golden curls,    And brown eyes full of grieving, Of one who still her steps delayed    When all the school were leaving.  For near her stood the little boy    Her childish favor singled: His cap pulled low upon a face    Where pride and shame were mingled.  Pushing with restless feet the snow    To right and left, he lingered;— As restlessly her tiny hands    The blue-checked apron fingered.  He saw her lift her eyes; he felt    The soft hand’s light caressing, And heard the tremble of her voice,    As if a fault confessing.  “I’m sorry that I spelt the word:    I hate to go above you, Because,”—the brown eyes lower fell,—    “Because, you see, I love you!”  Still memory to a gray-haired man    That sweet child-face is showing. Dear girl! the grasses on her grave    Have forty years been growing!  He lives to learn, in life’s hard school,    How few who pass above him Lament their triumph and his loss,    Like her,—because they love him.

He didn’t know, King Kleomenis, he didn’t dare—
he just didn’t know how to tell his mother
a thing like that: Ptolemy’s demand,
to guarantee their treaty, that she too go to Egypt
and be held there as a hostage—
a very humiliating, indecorous thing.
And he would be about to speak yet always hesitate,
would start to tell her yet always stop. 
But the magnificent woman understood him
(she’d already heard some rumors about it)
and she encouraged him to get it out.
And she laughed, saying of course she’d go,
happy even that in her old age
she could be useful to Sparta still. 
As for the humiliation—that didn’t touch her at all.
Of course an upstart like the Lagid
couldn’t possibly comprehend the Spartan spirit;
so his demand couldn’t in fact humiliate
a Royal Lady like herself:
mother of a Spartan king.

Flashing in the grass; the mouth of a spider clung   
          to the dark of it: the legs of the spider   
held the tucked wings close,
          held the abdomen still in the midst of calling   
with thrusts of phosphorescent light— 
When I am tired of being human, I try to remember
          the two stuck together like burrs. I try to place them   
central in my mind where everything else must
          surround them, must see the burr and the barb of them.   
There is courtship, and there is hunger. I suppose
          there are grips from which even angels cannot fly.   
Even imagined ones. Luciferin, luciferase.
          When I am tired of only touching,
I have my mouth to try to tell you
          what, in your arms, is not erased.

Hear my personal prayer, the words of my mouth and the meditation

In the desertI saw a creature, naked, bestial, Who, squatting upon the ground, Held his heart in his hands,And ate of it.I said, “Is it good, friend?”“It is bitter—bitter,” he answered; 
“But I like it“Because it is bitter,“And because it is my heart.”

I had never seen a cornfield in my life,
I had never been to Oklahoma,
But I was singing as loud as anyone,
“Oh what a beautiful morning. . . . The corn   
Is as high as an elephant’s eye,”
Though I knew something about elephants, I thought,   
Coming from the same continent as they did,   
And they being more like camels than anything else. 
And when we sang from Meet Me in St. Louis,   
“Clang, clang, clang went the trolley,”
I remembered the ride from Ramleh Station
In the heart of Alexandria
All the way to Roushdy where my grandmother lived,   
The autos on the roadways vying
With mule carts and bicycles,
The Mediterranean half a mile off on the left,   
The air smelling sharply of diesel and salt. 
It was a problem which had dogged me
For a few years, this confusion of places.
And when in 5th grade geography I had pronounced   
“Des Moines” as though it were a village in France,   
Mr. Kephart led me to the map on the front wall,   
And so I’d know where I was,
Pressed my forehead squarely against Iowa.
Des Moines, he’d said. Rhymes with coins. 
Now we were singing “zippidy-doo-dah, zippidy-ay,”   
And every song we’d sung had in it
Either sun or bluebirds, fair weather
Or fancy fringe, O beautiful America!
And one tier below me,
There was Linda Deemer with her amber waves
And lovely fruited plains,
And she was part of America too
Along with sun and spacious sky
Though untouchable, and as distant
As purple mountains of majesty. 
“This is my country,” we sang,
And a few years ago there would have been   
A scent of figs in the air, mangoes,
And someone playing the oud along a clear stream. 
But now it was “My country 'tis of thee”   
And I sang it out with all my heart   
And now with Linda Deemer in mind.   
“Land where my fathers died,” I bellowed,   
And it was not too hard to imagine
 
A host of my great-uncles and -grandfathers   
Stunned from their graves in the Turkish interior   
And finding themselves suddenly   
On a rock among maize and poultry   
And Squanto shaking their hands. 
How could anyone not think America   
Was exotic when it had Massachusetts   
And the long tables of thanksgiving?   
And how could it not be home
If it were the place where love first struck? 
We had finished singing.
The sun was shining through large windows   
On the beatified faces of all
Who had sung well and with feeling.
We were ready to file out and march back
To our room where Mr. Kephart was waiting.   
Already Linda Deemer had disappeared   
Into the high society of the hallway.
One day I was going to tell her something.   
Des Moines, I was saying to myself,
Baton Rouge. Terre Haute. Boise.

They have shown her facing, from a range of barley   
at times and from the patio. She wrings a sprig   
of mint in a walled garden; behold, the dimple that   
none reckoned on, careless burdens of plums, of parsley.   
I thank those gentlemen: many an old master   
is needed if there shall be love. I thank Velasquez   
more: for a woman turned away may be imposed   
without disparagement in a prospect of grandeur. 
Where this high cliff joins the deep sunlight I see you   
beside me spread aside in the buoyant deer-moss;   
I sit cross-legged nibbling juniper berries
and I call you my Louella now, now Ella Lou.
Far down from one rim is the bay with flocks of teal,   
and we might look down shafts of cedar the other way;   
I feel a privileged one who waits, remembering   
the special pleasure of youth is of self-denial. 
Since Velasquez and the masters have hexed my eyes   
I see you now even in this northern grandeur;   
following the hip I watch the flank’s retirement
and watch the nape declining from the crescent shoulder.   
But where your shoulder ripples back to fill the arm   
is a slight plump area, probably nameless:   
in all but rarest postures that form vanishes   
into wherever you withdraw inopportune breaths.   
You might not wonder it is there I, stretching forward,   
beseeching you be motionless, hold the wide kiss;   
I wonder mightily for my part for what purpose   
have I stretched a thousand miles between the two of us.

CHORUS Come we shepherds whose blest sight Hath met love’s noon in nature’s night; Come lift we up our loftier song And wake the sun that lies too long.  To all our world of well-stol’n joy        He slept, and dreamt of no such thing, While we found out heav’n’s fairer eye,        And kiss’d the cradle of our King. Tell him he rises now too late To show us aught worth looking at.  Tell him we now can show him more        Than he e’er show’d to mortal sight, Than he himself e’er saw before,        Which to be seen needs not his light. Tell him, Tityrus, where th’ hast been; Tell him, Thyrsis, what th’ hast seen.         TITYRUS Gloomy night embrac’d the place        Where the Noble Infant lay; The Babe look’d up and show’d his face,        In spite of darkness, it was day. It was thy day, Sweet! and did rise Not from the east, but from thine eyes.         CHORUS It was thy day, Sweet! and did rise Not from the east, but from thine eyes.         THYRSIS Winter chid aloud, and sent        The angry North to wage his wars; The North forgot his fierce intent,        And left perfumes instead of scars. By those sweet eyes’ persuasive pow’rs, Where he meant frost, he scatter’d flow’rs.         CHORUS By those sweet eyes’ persuasive pow’rs, Where he meant frost, he scatter’d flow’rs.         BOTH We saw thee in thy balmy nest,        Young dawn of our eternal day! We saw thine eyes break from their east        And chase the trembling shades away. We saw thee, and we bless’d the sight, We saw thee by thine own sweet light.         TITYRUS Poor World, said I, what wilt thou do        To entertain this starry stranger? Is this the best thou canst bestow,        A cold, and not too cleanly, manger? Contend, ye powers of heav’n and earth, To fit a bed for this huge birth.         CHORUS Contend, ye powers of heav’n and earth, To fit a bed for this huge birth.         THYRSIS Proud World, said I, cease your contest,        And let the Mighty Babe alone; The phoenix builds the phoenix’ nest,        Love’s architecture is his own; The Babe whose birth embraves this morn, Made his own bed ere he was born.         CHORUS The Babe whose birth embraves this morn, Made his own bed ere he was born.         TITYRUS I saw the curl’d drops, soft and slow,        Come hovering o’er the place’s head, Off’ring their whitest sheets of snow        To furnish the fair Infant’s bed. Forbear, said I, be not too bold;    Your fleece is white, but ’tis too cold.         CHORUS Forbear, said I, be not too bold; Your fleece is white, but ’tis too cold.         THYRSIS I saw the obsequious Seraphims        Their rosy fleece of fire bestow; For well they now can spare their wings,        Since Heav’n itself lies here below. Well done, said I, but are you sure Your down so warm will pass for pure?         CHORUS Well done, said I, but are you sure Your down so warm will pass for pure?         TITYRUS No no, your King’s not yet to seek        Where to repose his royal head; See see, how soon his new-bloom’d cheek        ’Twixt’s mother’s breasts is gone to bed. Sweet choice, said we! no way but so, Not to lie cold, yet sleep in snow.         CHORUS Sweet choice, said we! no way but so, Not to lie cold, yet sleep in snow.         BOTH We saw thee in thy balmy nest,        Bright dawn of our eternal day! We saw thine eyes break from their east,        And chase the trembling shades away. We saw thee, and we bless’d the sight, We saw thee, by thine own sweet light.         CHORUS We saw thee, and we bless’d the sight, We saw thee, by thine own sweet light.         FULL CHORUS Welcome, all wonders in one sight!        Eternity shut in a span; Summer in winter; day in night;        Heaven in earth, and God in man. Great little one, whose all-embracing birth Lifts earth to heaven, stoops heav’n to earth.  Welcome; though nor to gold nor silk,        To more than Caesar’s birthright is; Two sister seas of virgin-milk,        With many a rarely temper’d kiss, That breathes at once both maid and mother, Warms in the one, cools in the other.  Welcome, though not to those gay flies        Gilded i’ th’ beams of earthly kings, Slippery souls in smiling eyes;        But to poor shepherds, homespun things, Whose wealth’s their flock, whose wit, to be Well read in their simplicity.  Yet when young April’s husband-show’rs        Shall bless the fruitful Maia’s bed, We’ll bring the first-born of her flow’rs        To kiss thy feet and crown thy head. To thee, dread Lamb! whose love must keep The shepherds more than they the sheep.  To thee, meek Majesty! soft King        Of simple graces and sweet loves, Each of us his lamb will bring,        Each his pair of silver doves; Till burnt at last in fire of thy fair eyes, Ourselves become our own best sacrifice.

Far-sighted into yesterday
they stand, gripping
their charters and speeches,
the presidents and kings,
masters of unconscious evil. 
Their deputies are here —
judges, robed executioners,
steely and triumphant. 
And stunned at their feet,
the beheaded, the betrayed,
healed and hallowed now
in this grave sorrow of wax.  
       II 
We enter, adjust to the gloom,
to the lighting that plays
on the painted, staring faces. 
We think to ourselves, murmur
to the one standing beside us:
"How compellingly strange
these people are, and yet familiar
to the world we left behind us,
the street and the household..." 
These are the people whose names
we learned, whose lives we studied,
whose thoughts we have become. 
Each lighted stage with its play
of the lost and the violent —
comedians and stuntmen,
heroes transfixed in purpose. 
We pause, to read once more,
in deliberate, bald summation,
what art, wax, and history
have made of the dead: 
something more than a mirror,
less than a telling likeness;
an ideality slick with blood.  
       III 
How easily in the live heat
of truth and summer
these actors wilt and perish. 
Henry of Church and England
is here, savage and senile,
still laced in his armor;
his lopped and stunted wives
stand grouped around him. 
Bismark in his iron corset,
endlessly dividing Europe;
Wilhelm, that struttng dwarf,
abject in abdication. 
And here, the fatal mischief
of Sarajevo — how swift a fire,
how long a burning, came
of the Archduke's festive ride,
his shot and bloodied tunic. 
And no more telling prophecy
in the wake of armistice
than that one dated cartoon
with its hooded sentry
and its graveyard owl:
"It has been six years..." 
How easily a puff of smoke,
a square of burnt cloth,
a shocked cry, can change
the world, and leave it
neither worse nor better.  
       IV 
Here is a man, thief or martyr,
hanged at Damascus Gate
with a hook through his gut. 
He swung, seared by the sun
and kissed by the night.
And maybe one of the market
women brought him water,
and maybe not — once seen
by the Sultan's watch,
she might have lost her hands. 
As in the time of Richelieu,
certain men the crown accused
were exposed in iron baskets
like plucked birds. 
They fouled their nests,
starved and blackened until
they died; and the city lived
with their cries, their rank
mortality, night and day. 
The hook is black and crescent,
the body swings, inert,
as if asleep and dreaming. 
The guidebook tells us the man
survived his hook and lived;
it doesn't say how long.  
       V 
Here, with his tins and furs,
is Minuit, buying Manhattan.
We see the Dutchman's flourish,   
the Indians' foolish feathers. 
He takes their land, and they
his bitter gifts, his brass
and trinkets — so little cash
in place of an earthy kingdom. 
Wolfe, Montcalm, on the plain
below Quebec: the one dying,
the other condemned to follow. 
We pass, reading from face to face,
from book to book, uneasy
that among these celebrations
so many rigged transactions
have gone unquestioned. 
And all our wigged colonials,
our Franklins, conspiring
with their strongbox keys
and profitable lightning — 
that so much ink and dust
and shuffled paper conceals
their tidy pilferings,
their purity and blunted wrath. 
Were there rooms in this house,
each with its tabled motions
and false partitions
might furnish a history,
one slow truth at a time. 
But never in our late arrival
have we stilled confusion,
to learn how great a folly
follows in the wake of fathers. 
From their deliberate violence
we come to our own lamed
misrule, its slick banality
and crime without passion.    
To Ike, to Kennedy and Ford,
golfers and temporizers;
to perennial candidate Nixon,
whose cheek was never turned. 
Out of his sleek arrest
he steps towards us,
as if to greet a voter — 
a fixed, ferocious smile
on the blue jowls
brushed with powder.  
       VI 
Nothing we have painted
and framed in our passage —
neither prayer nor courtship,
nor solace of sleep
and self — escaped the grip
of these iron centuries. 
Here, in a row of lighted
cases, a few artifacts
are on display. No comfort
to us now in that familiar,
edged interrogation... 
But the biting persuasion
of chains and collars,
of inching racks, fire tongs
and screws — in the eyes
of kings and churchmen
the instruments of truth. 
And whosoever might trespass,
on whatever lawful ground,
would find for his solace
a more forbidding marriage. 
As once in a stone embrasure
I saw a belt for virgins,
a hinged and rusted clasp,
with a lock, and a slit
for functions — all but one. 
Imagine with what shocked
dismay a man might grope
for his sweetness there,
and all too soon awaken,
clamped in his ecstasy.  
       VII 
Another room,
with smaller people
and thinner walls. 
Here the Queen plays
with cryptic cards,
hands out assignments: 
"You are the Hunchback,"
she says, "and You
the Hangman, and You
the Jack of Trades." 
She pares and quarters
her venomous apple,
calls for her mirror,
and her image smiles
to watch her glass
fill up with poison. 
Beauty is sleeping,
the Prince is awake,
and far in the forest
a frostlight winks
from the Sugar House. 
The Witch is singing
and lighting her oven.
The Woodcutter's
wayward children watch,
they break and nibble
the sweetened glass. 
The images whisper
and darken, conspiring
in their tumbled tale
of fretful spinners,
of drones and dumble-
dores, wise eggs
that speak and shatter. 
And it looks as if
the painted sleepers
in this dreamworks
are about to awaken: 
the crafty Queen
and her players,
the musical mice,
the drones
and the spinners — 
All in a scampering
rush, to find
the nearest exit... 
As the looking glass
draws us deeper
into the bright play
of shadows that melt
and run and freeze... 
The mad, mad romp
of children, of rabbits
and dwarfs, who keep
their strange hilarity
in so much horror.  
       VIII 
Call those from underneath,
the sold and trodden,
their slow and sweating sons,
elevate and crown them. 
Patch up their clothing
and wash their skins,
rub their faces
until they glow,
and their dull eyes brighten. 
Give them speeches to learn,
and eloquent gestures,
power to grasp,
laws to break and mend. 
Great heat and furious labor
bring on in them
this drear and mystical change: 
At first a swinish fattening,
and then a leaner look,
and in their eyes
the same feral glitter
of their late unkindly masters. 
They sicken as they flourish, 
until like wickless candles
they slump and totter;
their heads are rotten,
their famous flesh
has run to sticky pools. 
They die and sleep afoot,
their ignorant hearts
grown wise in the ways of wax.  
       IX 
In all these wax memorials
only appearance changes. 
Crowned heads and axes fall,
thugs and jailors rise
and displace each other
in this long, uneasy walk
we have littered
with claims and captions. 
The heroes are always welcomed,
are propped and shaven,
their ruddy male composure
is sleeker than ever,
though the great sleeves
and brutal collars
give way to softer buttons. 
The paper in official hands
rustles as before,
though it is only paper,
paper in cheap supply,
and not the bleached fell
of a difficult sheep. 
And yet the neat persuasions   
are seen to tighten,
and each new litigation
is a running noose... 
All that increases,
all that gluts and fattens,
matures its option here:
Honor to thieves and merchants,
long life to the butcher. 
And for the just petitioner —
sweeper of the hallways, scapegoat
and discard — no reply
but the rote of legal fictions; 
to which he listens, now
as in the days of Pontinus,
stricken with understanding.  
       X 
The rooms are large and numerous,
and we in our restless striding
find that they never end. 
It is as if we had lived here
always, captive to this endless
and malign instruction;
had served those mighty tempers,
and learned too well
these never-blotted names. 
And we live here still,
sharing these murderous spaces,
this blood-haunted silence. 
And once we started from sleep,
terrorized and whimpering,
to see in the luminous,
sunken light, the head
of a long-forgotten agent: 
a face like a father,
one who might have comforted,
but cannot see or hear us:
bald, vacant, and amused.  
       XI 
All is as it must or might be,
here at the story's end —
the jury dismissed, the witness
excused, and all are guilty. 
To have come so far, walked
so easily through so much anguish,
pride, and stupor of evil,
and yet we are standing still,
locked in an echoing foyer. 
In so driven, so brief an itinerary,
a day will stand for a decade,
an inch for a mile — so far
has a painted fiction served us. 
These bones in their period costumes
would bend if we touched them;
their flesh would yield,
and all arrangements topple. 
But see how they bring toward us
the old, sustaining gestures —
a stride, an arm outstretched —
the furrows in the smiles
deepen, and the red lips smear. 
Great captains command, obedient
ranks go down. In all these propped
assemblies I know a substance
neither wax nor wholly flesh —
a tried and mortal nature,
familiar as the warmth in my hand.  
       XII 
Were we not lost, condemned
to repeat these names
and to honor their crimes,
a voice among us might cry out,
speak to those who are
stopped here:
                     Whose faces are these
that melt and run? 
Children and guardians, giants
and dwarfs —
                   Oh, people, people...
Who are these heroes
and where are their victims? 
We who are standing here
with our guidebooks suddenly closed
and all the exits darkened... 
Until another gallery opens,
or the sun through that skylight
strikes us all —
                     souls in torment,
pilgrims and doting fathers...

Unwitting accomplice in the scheme of law
she thought to violate, man-set as it was,
and, here, inconsequential as the sun
at midnight, drought at flood-time—
when she heard a baby in the tall reeds
at the river’s brink, she was nobody’s
daughter, subject of no rule
but the one his need for her established
as she knelt down to quell his crying
with a little tune just seeing him there
had taught her how to hum. 
                                        Now as then,
it is the same tune, timelessly in time,
your mother hums as she kneels down
beside your little barge of foam,
smiling to see you smile when she wrings
out from the sponge a ragged string
of water over the chest and belly,
the dimpled loins, the bud so far
from flowering, and the foot slick
as a fish your hand tries to hold up
till it slips back splashing
with such mild turbulence that she laughs,
and you laugh to see her laugh. 
Here now, as it was then, it is still
so many years before the blood’s smeared
over doorposts, before the Nile clots
with the first-born, and the women
wailing,wailing throughout the city;
here now again is the kingdom of pleasure,
where they are safe still, mother and child,
from the chartered rod of the Fathers,
and where a father can still pray, Lord,
Jealous Chooser, Devouring Law, keep
away from them, just keep away.

House of five fires, you never raised me.
Those nights when the throat of the furnace
wheezed and rattled its regular death,
I wanted your wide door, 
your mottled air of bark and working sunlight,
wanted your smokehole with its stars,
and your roof curving its singing mouth above me.
Here are the tiers once filled with sleepers, 
and their low laughter measured harmony or strife.
Here I could wake amazed at winter,
my breath in the draft a chain of violets.
The house I left as a child now seems 
a shell of sobs. Each year I dream it sinister
and dig in my heels to keep out the intruder
banging at the back door. My eyes burn
from cat urine under the basement stairs 
and the hall reveals a nameless hunger,
as if without a history, I should always walk
the cluttered streets of this hapless continent.
Thinking it best I be wanderer, 
I rode whatever river, ignoring every zigzag,
every spin. I’ve been a fragment, less than my name,
shaking in a solitary landscape,
like the last burnt leaf on an oak. 
What autumn wind told me you’d be waiting?
House of five fires, they take you for a tomb,
but I know better. When desolation comes,
I’ll hide your ridgepole in my spine 
and melt into crow call, reminding my children
that spiders near your door
joined all the reddening blades of grass
without oil, hasp or uranium.

Beginning to dangle beneath
The wind that blows from the undermined wood,   
      I feel the great pulley grind, 
      The thread I cling to lengthen   
And let me soaring and spinning down into marble,
      Hooked and weightlessly happy 
      Where the squared sun shines
Back equally from all four sides, out of stone   
      And years of dazzling labor, 
      To land at last among men
Who cut with power saws a Parian whiteness
      And, chewing slow tobacco, 
      Their eyebrows like frost,
Shunt house-sized blocks and lash them to cables   
      And send them heavenward 
      Into small-town banks,
Into the columns and statues of government buildings,   
      But mostly graves. 
      I mount my monument and rise
Slowly and spinningly from the white-gloved men   
      Toward the hewn sky 
      Out of the basement of light,
Sadly, lifted through time’s blinding layers   
      On perhaps my tombstone 
      In which the original shape
Michelangelo believed was in every rock upon earth   
      Is heavily stirring, 
      Surprised to be an angel,
To be waked in North Georgia by the ponderous play   
      Of men with ten-ton blocks 
      But no more surprised than I
To feel sadness fall off as though I myself   
      Were rising from stone 
      Held by a thread in midair,
Badly cut, local-looking, and totally uninspired,   
      Not a masterwork 
      Or even worth seeing at all
But the spirit of this place just the same,   
      Felt here as joy.

What seemed a mystery was
in fact a choice. Insert bird for sorrow.    
What seemed a memory was in fact
a dividing line. Insert bird for wind.    
Insert wind for departure when everyone is
standing still. Insert three mountains 
burning and in three valleys a signal seer
seeing a distant light and a signal bearer 
sprinting to a far-off bell. What seemed
a promise was in fact a sigh.    
What seemed a hot wind, a not quite enough,   
a forgive me, it has flown away, is in fact.    
In the meantime we paint the floors
red. We stroke the sound of certain names 
into a fine floss that drifts across our teeth.
We stay in the room we share and listen 
all night to what drifts through the window—
dog growl, owl call, a fleet of mosquitoes 
setting sail, and down the road,   
the swish of tomorrow’s donkey-threshed grain.

In the naked bed, in Plato’s cave,
Reflected headlights slowly slid the wall,   
Carpenters hammered under the shaded window,   
Wind troubled the window curtains all night long,   
A fleet of trucks strained uphill, grinding,   
Their freights covered, as usual.
The ceiling lightened again, the slanting diagram   
Slid slowly forth.
                            Hearing the milkman’s chop,   
His striving up the stair, the bottle’s chink,   
I rose from bed, lit a cigarette,
And walked to the window. The stony street   
Displayed the stillness in which buildings stand,   
The street-lamp’s vigil and the horse’s patience.   
The winter sky’s pure capital
Turned me back to bed with exhausted eyes. 
Strangeness grew in the motionless air. The loose   
Film grayed. Shaking wagons, hooves’ waterfalls,   
Sounded far off, increasing, louder and nearer.   
A car coughed, starting. Morning, softly   
Melting the air, lifted the half-covered chair   
From underseas, kindled the looking-glass,   
Distinguished the dresser and the white wall.   
The bird called tentatively, whistled, called,   
Bubbled and whistled, so! Perplexed, still wet   
With sleep, affectionate, hungry and cold. So, so,   
O son of man, the ignorant night, the travail   
Of early morning, the mystery of beginning   
Again and again,
                         while History is unforgiven.

He described her mouth as full of ashes.
So when he kissed her finally
he was thinking about ashes 
and the blacker rim just below
the edge of the ashtray,
and the faint dark rim that outlined her lips, 
and the lips themselves, at the limit
of another darkness, farther
and far more interior. 
Then the way the red,
paling, just outside those lines
caught fire and the pages caught 
soon after that. Slowly at first,
but then all at once
at the scalloped brown corners of each; 
like the ruff of an offended and darkening bird,
extended, then folded
in on itself; multiple, 
stiffening, gone.

Leave go my hands, let me catch breath and see; Let the dew-fall drench either side of me;     Clear apple-leaves are soft upon that moon Seen sidelong like a blossom in the tree;     And God, ah God, that day should be so soon.  The grass is thick and cool, it lets us lie. Kissed upon either cheek and either eye,     I turn to thee as some green afternoon Turns toward sunset, and is loth to die;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon.  Lie closer, lean your face upon my side, Feel where the dew fell that has hardly dried,     Hear how the blood beats that went nigh to swoon; The pleasure lives there when the sense has died,     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon.  O my fair lord, I charge you leave me this: It is not sweeter than a foolish kiss?     Nay take it then, my flower, my first in June, My rose, so like a tender mouth it is:     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon.  Love, till dawn sunder night from day with fire Dividing my delight and my desire,     The crescent life and love the plenilune, Love me though dusk begin and dark retire;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon.  Ah, my heart fails, my blood draws back; I know, When life runs over, life is near to go;     And with the slain of love love’s ways are strewn, And with their blood, if love will have it so;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon.  Ah, do thy will now; slay me if thou wilt; There is no building now the walls are built,     No quarrying now the corner-stone is hewn, No drinking now the vine’s whole blood is spilt;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon.  Nay, slay me now; nay, for I will be slain; Pluck thy red pleasure from the teeth of pain,     Break down thy vine ere yet grape-gatherers prune, Slay me ere day can slay desire again;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon.  Yea, with thy sweet lips, with thy sweet sword; yea Take life and all, for I will die, I say;     Love, I gave love, is life a better boon? For sweet night’s sake I will not live till day;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon.  Nay, I will sleep then only; nay, but go. Ah sweet, too sweet to me, my sweet, I know     Love, sleep, and death go to the sweet same tune; Hold my hair fast, and kiss me through it soon.     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon.

for Susan Koethe



This is the life I wanted, and could never see.
For almost twenty years I thought that it was enough:   
That real happiness was either unreal, or lost, or endless,
And that remembrance was as close to it as I could ever come.   
And I believed that deep in the past, buried in my heart   
Beyond the depth of sight, there was a kingdom of peace.   
And so I never imagined that when peace would finally come
It would be on a summer evening, a few blocks away from home   
In a small suburban park, with some children playing aimlessly   
In an endless light, and a lake shining in the distance. 
Eventually, sometime around the middle of your life,
There’s a moment when the first imagination begins to wane.   
The future that had always seemed so limitless dissolves,   
And the dreams that used to seem so real float up and fade.   
The years accumulate; but they start to take on a mild,
Human tone beyond imagination, like the sound the heart makes   
Pouring into the past its hymns of adoration and regret.   
And then gradually the moments quicken into life,
Vibrant with possibility, sovereign, dense, serene;
And then the park is empty and the years are still. 
I think the saddest memory is of a kind of light,
A kind of twilight, that seemed to permeate the air
For a few years after I’d grown up and gone away from home.   
It was limitless and free. And of course I was going to change,   
But freedom means that only aspects ever really change,   
And that as the past recedes and the future floats away
You turn into what you are. And so I stayed basically the same   
As what I’d always been, while the blond light in the trees   
Became part of my memory, and my voice took on the accents   
Of a mind infatuated with the rhetoric of farewell. 
And now that disembodied grief has gone away.   
It was a flickering, literary kind of sadness,
The suspension of a life between two other lives   
Of continual remembrance, between two worlds
In which there’s too much solitude, too much disdain.   
But the sadness that I felt was real sadness,   
And this elation now a real tremor as the deepening   
Shadows lengthen upon the lake. This calm is real,   
But how much of the real past can it absorb?   
How far into the future can this peace extend? 
I love the way the light falls over the suburbs
Late on these summer evenings, as the buried minds   
Stir in their graves, the hearts swell in the warm earth   
And the soul settles from the air into its human home.   
This is where the prodigal began, and now his day is ending   
In a great dream of contentment, where all night long   
The children sleep within tomorrow’s peaceful arms
And the past is still, and suddenly we turn around and smile   
At the memory of a vast, inchoate dream of happiness,   
Now that we know that none of it is ever going to be. 
Don’t you remember how free the future seemed
When it was all imagination? It was a beautiful park
Where the sky was a page of water, and when we looked up,   
There were our own faces, shimmering in the clear air.   
And I know that this life is the only real form of happiness,   
But sometimes in its midst I can hear the dense, stifled sob   
Of the unreal one we might have known, and when that ends   
And my eyes are filled with tears, time seems to have stopped   
And we are alone in the park where it is almost twenty years ago   
And the future is still an immense, open dream.

The setting of houses, cafés, the neighborhood
that I’ve seen and walked through years on end: 
I created you while I was happy, while I was sad,
with so many incidents, so many details. 
And, for me, the whole of you has been transformed into feeling.


^^EOP^^

I scratch earth around timpsila 
on this hill, while below me,
hanging in still air, a hawk
searches the creekbed for my brothers.
Squat leaves, I’ll braid your roots
into such long ropes, they’ll cover
the rump of my stallion.
Withered flower, feed us now
buffalo rot in the waist-high grass. 
Hear my sisters laugh?
They dream of feasts, of warriors
to owl dance with them
when this war is over. They don’t see
our children eating treebark, cornstalks,
these roots. Their eyes gleam
in shallow cheeks. The wagon people
do not think relationship is wealth. 
Sisters, last night the wind
returned my prayer, allowing me to hear
Dog Soldiers singing at Ash Hollow.
I threw away my blanket
stained with lies.
Above the wings of my tipi,
I heard the old woman in Maka Sica
sigh for us. Then I knew
the distance of High Back Bone’s death-
fire from another world away. Even they
may never stop its motion. 
Yesterday at noon, I heard
my Cheyenne sister moan as she waded
through deep snow before soldiers
cut up her corpse to sell
as souvenirs. Are my brothers
here? Ghosts bring all my joy.
I walk this good road between rock
and sky. They dare not threaten with death
one already dead.

(A true incident)

‘Only a local anaesthetic was given because of the blood pressure problem. The patient, thus, was fully awake throughout the operation. But in those days—in 1938, in Cardiff, when I was Lambert Rogers’ dresser—they could not locate a brain tumour with precision. Too much normal brain tissue was destroyed as the surgeon searched for it, before he felt the resistance of it … all somewhat hit and miss. One operation I shall never forget … ’
                          (Dr Wilfred Abse)



Sister saying—‘Soon you’ll be back in the ward,’   
sister thinking—‘Only two more on the list,’   
the patient saying—‘Thank you, I feel fine’;   
small voices, small lies, nothing untoward,   
though, soon, he would blink again and again   
because of the fingers of Lambert Rogers,   
rash as a blind man’s, inside his soft brain. 
If items of horror can make a man laugh
then laugh at this: one hour later, the growth
still undiscovered, ticking its own wild time;
more brain mashed because of the probe’s braille path;   
Lambert Rogers desperate, fingering still;
his dresser thinking, ‘Christ! Two more on the list,   
a cisternal puncture and a neural cyst.’ 
Then, suddenly, the cracked record in the brain,   
a ventriloquist voice that cried, ‘You sod,   
leave my soul alone, leave my soul alone,’—   
the patient’s dummy lips moving to that refrain,   
the patient’s eyes too wide. And, shocked,   
Lambert Rogers drawing out the probe
with nurses, students, sister, petrified. 
‘Leave my soul alone, leave my soul alone,’   
that voice so arctic and that cry so odd   
had nowhere else to go—till the antique   
gramophone wound down and the words began
to blur and slow, ‘ … leave … my … soul … alone … ’   
to cease at last when something other died.   
And silence matched the silence under snow.

And now the green household is dark.   
The half-moon completely is shining   
On the earth-lighted tops of the trees.   
To be dead, a house must be still.
The floor and the walls wave me slowly;   
I am deep in them over my head.   
The needles and pine cones about me 
Are full of small birds at their roundest,   
Their fists without mercy gripping
Hard down through the tree to the roots   
To sing back at light when they feel it.   
We lie here like angels in bodies,
My brothers and I, one dead,
The other asleep from much living, 
In mid-air huddled beside me.
Dark climbed to us here as we climbed
Up the nails I have hammered all day
Through the sprained, comic rungs of the ladder   
Of broom handles, crate slats, and laths
Foot by foot up the trunk to the branches   
Where we came out at last over lakes 
Of leaves, of fields disencumbered of earth   
That move with the moves of the spirit.   
Each nail that sustains us I set here;
Each nail in the house is now steadied
By my dead brother’s huge, freckled hand.   
Through the years, he has pointed his hammer   
Up into these limbs, and told us 
That we must ascend, and all lie here.   
Step after step he has brought me,   
Embracing the trunk as his body,
Shaking its limbs with my heartbeat,   
Till the pine cones danced without wind   
And fell from the branches like apples.   
In the arm-slender forks of our dwelling 
I breathe my live brother’s light hair.   
The blanket around us becomes
As solid as stone, and it sways.
With all my heart, I close
The blue, timeless eye of my mind.   
Wind springs, as my dead brother smiles   
And touches the tree at the root; 
A shudder of joy runs up
The trunk; the needles tingle;   
One bird uncontrollably cries.
The wind changes round, and I stir   
Within another’s life. Whose life?
Who is dead? Whose presence is living?   
When may I fall strangely to earth, 
Who am nailed to this branch by a spirit?   
Can two bodies make up a third?
To sing, must I feel the world’s light?   
My green, graceful bones fill the air   
With sleeping birds. Alone, alone
And with them I move gently.
I move at the heart of the world.

I remember a house where all were good    To me, God knows, deserving no such thing:    Comforting smell breathed at very entering, Fetched fresh, as I suppose, off some sweet wood. That cordial air made those kind people a hood    All over, as a bevy of eggs the mothering wing    Will, or mild nights the new morsels of Spring: Why, it seemed of course; seemed of right it should.  Lovely the woods, waters, meadows, combes, vales, All the air things wear that build this world of Wales;    Only the inmate does not correspond: God, lover of souls, swaying considerate scales, Complete thy creature dear O where it fails,    Being mighty a master, being a father and fond.

Whenever I see two women
       crowned, constellated friends 
it is as if three birch trees wept together
       in a field by a constant spring. 
               The third woman isn’t there 
exactly, but just before them a flame
       bursts out, then disappears 
in a blurred, electric shining
       that lifts my hair like an animal’s. 
In an aura of charged air I remember
         my poor mother turned into royalty,
               my sister and me in bobby socks 
endlessly, all summer long
       calling each other Margaret Rose 
and Lillibet, Lillibet, Lillibet,
       pretending to be princesses... 
Now, swollen into these tall blooms
       like paper cutouts in water, 
in each new neighborhood garden
         always, two women talking 
nod their three curly heads together:
       with bits of dirt on their foreheads, speckled
               iris, flaming poppy 
in the backyard dynasties of the multiflora
         it is the famous funeral photograph
               of the Dowager Queen, Queen Mother, stunned Young Queen, 
three stepping stones in marble
         that haunt me forever, clear
                and mysterious as well water, the weight of it 
in a bronze bucket swinging
                  powerfully from my hand. 
As the plumcolored shadow rises,
          full as a first child in the orchard, 
the lost gardening glove on the path,
                   the single earring tucked 
       in an odd corner of the purse and then found 
here double themselves, then triple:
         in these soft trinities
                  the lives that begin in us 
are born and born again like wings.
       Secret as doves scuffling 
in the wide envelope of wombs
                like loose, comfortable aprons flung 
over the heads of friends leaning together
       in the hum of earth’s plainsong 
like a three part round,
       like a single voice murmuring
                      the dream never leaves us, of the self 
like a three masted vessel still voyaging:
            out of the long matrix of memory,
                     the royal bulbs in the hold, 
the ballast that keeps us upright, loyal
                to the dark, deep-bedded throne
       of the old country each new soul claims as its own.

Adieu, farewell, earth’s bliss; This world uncertain is; Fond are life’s lustful joys; Death proves them all but toys; None from his darts can fly; I am sick, I must die.    Lord, have mercy on us!  Rich men, trust not in wealth, Gold cannot buy you health; Physic himself must fade. All things to end are made, The plague full swift goes by; I am sick, I must die.    Lord, have mercy on us!  Beauty is but a flower Which wrinkles will devour; Brightness falls from the air; Queens have died young and fair; Dust hath closed Helen’s eye. I am sick, I must die.    Lord, have mercy on us!  Strength stoops unto the grave, Worms feed on Hector’s brave; Swords may not fight with fate, Earth still holds ope her gate. “Come, come!” the bells do cry. I am sick, I must die.    Lord, have mercy on us.  Wit with his wantonness Tasteth death’s bitterness; Hell’s executioner Hath no ears for to hear What vain art can reply. I am sick, I must die.    Lord, have mercy on us.  Haste, therefore, each degree, To welcome destiny; Heaven is our heritage, Earth but a player’s stage; Mount we unto the sky. I am sick, I must die.    Lord, have mercy on us.

At four o’clock it’s dark.
Today, looking out through dusk
at three gray women in stretch slacks
chatting in front of the post office,
their steps left and right and back
like some quick folk dance of kindness,
I remembered the winter we spent
crying in each other’s laps.
What could you be thinking at this moment?
How lovely and strange the gangly spines
of trees against a thickening sky
as you drive from the library
humming off-key? Or are you smiling
at an idea met in a book
the way you smiled with your whole body
the first night we talked?
I was so sure my love of you was perfect,
and the light today
reminded me of the winter you drove home
each day in the dark at four o’clock
and would come into my study to kiss me
despite mistake after mistake after mistake.

                    Even before I saw the chambered nautilus
I wanted to sail not in the us navy
Tonight I'm waiting for you, your letter
At the same time his letter, the view of you
By him and then by me in the park, no rhymes
I saw you, this is in prose, no it's not
Sitting with the molluscs & anemones in an
Empty autumn enterprise baby you look pretty
With your long eventual hair, is love king?
What's this? A sonnet? Love's a babe we know that
I'm coming up, I'm coming, Shakespeare only stuck
To one subject but I'll mention nobody said
You have to get young Americans some ice cream
In the artificial light in which she woke

Human reason is beautiful and invincible.
No bars, no barbed wire, no pulping of books,
No sentence of banishment can prevail against it.
It establishes the universal ideas in language,
And guides our hand so we write Truth and Justice
With capital letters, lie and oppression with small.
It puts what should be above things as they are,
Is an enemy of despair and a friend of hope.
It does not know Jew from Greek or slave from master,
Giving us the estate of the world to manage.
It saves austere and transparent phrases
From the filthy discord of tortured words.
It says that everything is new under the sun,
Opens the congealed fist of the past.
Beautiful and very young are Philo-Sophia
And poetry, her ally in the service of the good.
As late as yesterday Nature celebrated their birth,
The news was brought to the mountains by a unicorn and an echo.
Their friendship will be glorious, their time has no limit.
Their enemies have delivered themselves to destruction.  Berkeley, 1968

for Louis Asekoff



Mid-October, Massachusetts. We drive   
through the livid innards of a beast—dragon   
or salamander—whose home is fire. The hills   
a witch’s quilt of goldrust, flushed cinnamon,
wine fever, hectic lemon. After dark,
while water ruffles, salted, in a big pot, we four   
gather towards the woodfire, exchanging   
lazy sentences, waiting dinner. Sunk   
in the supermarket cardboard box,
the four lobsters tip and coolly stroke each other   
with rockblue baton legs and tentative
antennae, their breath a wet clicking, the undulant   
slow shift of their plated bodies   
like the doped drift of patients   
in the padded ward. Eyes like squished berries
out on stalks. It’s the end of the line
for them, yet faintly in that close-companioned air   
they smell the sea, a shadow-haunted hole to hide in   
till all this blows over.
                                     When it’s time,
we turn the music up to nerve us
to it, then take them one by one and drop   
in the salty roil and scald, then clamp
the big lid back. Grasping the shapely fantail,   
I plunge mine in headfirst and feel   
before I can detach myself the flat slap   
of a jackknifed back, glimpse for an instant   
before I put the lid on it
the rigid backward bow-bend of the whole body
as the brain explodes and lidless eyes   
sear white. We two are bound in silence   
till the pot-lid planks back and music
floods again, like a tide. Minutes later,
the four of us bend to brittle pink intricate   
shells, drawing white sweet flesh
with our fingers, sewing our shroud-talk
tight about us. Later, near moonless midnight,   
when I scrape the leafbright broken remains   
into the garbage can outside, that last   
knowing spasm eels up my arm again   
and off, like a flash, across the rueful stars.

Forty degrees; the threat of rain. That time of fall
         When we are most inclined to end it all.
Denim-jacketed, with a faded sweatshirt hood,
         He draws his plane along a length of wood,
         Then takes a chisel to a cornice piece
         With two light taps. His movements never cease;
His cracked and callused hands, in gloves with fingers cut,
Rub up for warmth, then start like hares hawked by his thought. 
He knows no other work; wants none. He learned this from
         His father—brace and auger, bob and plumb—
The same way he learned how to hunt or take a beating:
         Not by words but by a look, and by repeating
         Mutely each grimace, wince, set of the jaw.
         His job is more than workmanlike. No flaw
Or gap offends the eye. Each post and bull-nose stair
Seems proof of love—if love is proved by excess care.

Home’s the place we head for in our sleep.   
Boxcars stumbling north in dreams
don’t wait for us. We catch them on the run.   
The rails, old lacerations that we love,   
shoot parallel across the face and break   
just under Turtle Mountains. Riding scars
you can’t get lost. Home is the place they cross. 
The lame guard strikes a match and makes the dark   
less tolerant. We watch through cracks in boards   
as the land starts rolling, rolling till it hurts   
to be here, cold in regulation clothes.
We know the sheriff’s waiting at midrun
to take us back. His car is dumb and warm.
The highway doesn’t rock, it only hums
like a wing of long insults. The worn-down welts   
of ancient punishments lead back and forth. 
All runaways wear dresses, long green ones,
the color you would think shame was. We scrub   
the sidewalks down because it's shameful work.   
Our brushes cut the stone in watered arcs   
and in the soak frail outlines shiver clear
a moment, things us kids pressed on the dark   
face before it hardened, pale, remembering
delicate old injuries, the spines of names and leaves.

It’s spring in 1827, Beethoven
hoists his death-mask and sails off. 
The grindstones are turning in Europe’s windmills.
The wild geese are flying northwards. 
Here is the north, here is Stockholm
swimming palaces and hovels. 
The logs in the royal fireplace
collapse from Attention to At Ease. 
Peace prevails, vaccine and potatoes,
but the city wells breathe heavily. 
Privy barrels in sedan chairs like paschas
are carried by night over the North Bridge. 
The cobblestones make them stagger
mamselles loafers gentlemen. 
Implacably still, the sign-board
with the smoking blackamoor. 
So many islands, so much rowing
with invisible oars against the current! 
The channels open up, April May
and sweet honey dribbling June. 
The heat reaches islands far out.
The village doors are open, except one. 
The snake-clock’s pointer licks the silence.
The rock slopes glow with geology’s patience. 
It happened like this, or almost.
It is an obscure family tale 
about Erik, done down by a curse
disabled by a bullet through the soul. 
He went to town, met an enemy
and sailed home sick and grey. 
Keeps to his bed all that summer.
The tools on the wall are in mourning. 
He lies awake, hears the woolly flutter
of night moths, his moonlight comrades. 
His strength ebbs out, he pushes in vain
against the iron-bound tomorrow. 
And the God of the depths cries out of the depths
‘Deliver me! Deliver yourself!’ 
All the surface action turns inwards.
He’s taken apart, put together. 
The wind rises and the wild rose bushes
catch on the fleeing light. 
The future opens, he looks into
the self-rotating kaleidoscope 
sees indistinct fluttering faces
family faces not yet born. 
By mistake his gaze strikes me
as I walk around here in Washington 
among grandiose houses where only   
every second column bears weight. 
White buildings in crematorium style
where the dream of the poor turns to ash. 
The gentle downward slope gets steeper
and imperceptibly becomes an abyss.

Zeus always introduces himself   
As one who needs stitching   
Back together with kisses.   
Like a rock star in leather 
& sapphires—conflagration
& a trick of silk falling
Between lost chances & never   
Again. His disguises are almost 
Mathematical, as Io & Europa   
Pass from their dreams into his.   
This lord of storm clouds
Is also a sun god crooning desire 
& dalliance in a garden of nymphs.
Some days, he loves gloxinia,
& others, craves garlic blooms—
Hera, Aegina, & Callisto in the same song.

Take this: for nothing here’s chiming, vibrating
and all this vainglory and self-deprecating
just goads at the tender parts, gets irritating. 
You’ll make no advance advocating monopoly
on any vocabulary; even cacophony
needs the needle to make its point properly. 
It’s true that you find yourself fey and bewitching,
yet always you feel that the itch that you’re scratching’s
soothed better by far by bravadoes of bitching. 
The off-pat flyting, back-biting and threnody
you render and throw up, at will, won’t remedy
the rot of your serenading, lute-laden wannabe. 
You can’t see a barrier without pushing through it;
it’s a poor pearl of pathos you don’t disintuit
and you now give a doing when once you’d just do it. 
You want my advice? Here it is: try removing
the self from your argument - gluts of self-loving
just pudding the gut of whatever you’re proving. 
That’s it on the chin and I’m sure you can take it,
but that shadow you’re boxing is me, so please break it
gently. Best wishes, I hope that you make it.

                    This tree has two million and seventy-five thousand leaves. Perhaps I missed a leaf or two but I do feel triumphant at having persisted in counting by hand branch by branch and marked down on paper with pencil each total. Adding them up was a pleasure I could understand; I did something on my own that was not dependent on others, and to count leaves is not less meaningful than to count the stars, as astronomers are always doing. They want the facts to be sure they have them all. It would help them to know whether the world is finite. I discovered one tree that is finite. I must try counting the hairs on my head, and you too. We could swap information.

In Canada, on a dark afternoon,
from a cabin beside Lake Purgatory
I saw your two clenched fists in a tree—
your most recent rage—until I came to my senses,
and saw two small lighted glass lamps reflected
through a window onto the maple leaves.
Was it simply that I had stolen away
in the wilderness to go fishing on your birthday,
twelve years after your death, and you
less than your rusty pliers in my fishing box? 
It is late August in the moral North.
To answer your first question,
I obey the fish and game laws
of New York State, Ontario and Quebec.
The odd branch has already turned red.
As for me I have turned inside out,
I cry for revolution against myself—
no longer red, I’m parlor pink and gray,
you, less than a thumb print on a page. 
Matters still outstanding: you will not remember—
a boy, I cut school, sneaked out
to the 42nd Street library to read among readers
like a stray lion cub taken into a great pride.
I have kept your Greek grammar,
your 78 revolutions per minute
recording of Rossini’s Barber
you played to stop me from crying,
almost my first memory.
Your “valuable papers,” now valuable
only to me, I fed to a fire years ago.
Frankly I am tired of receiving letters from the dead
every day, and carrying you on my back,
out of the burning city,
in and out of the bathroom and bedroom,
you less than the smoke you wanted for a shroud. 
Let us dance with Sarah behind the curtain
where God in his divine humor
tells Abraham Sarah will at ninety bear a son,
and she asks laughing within herself, “Will I have pleasure?”
Take one foot, then the other … Imitate a departure
if you make it not, and each going
will lend a kind of easiness to the next.
Father, you poisoned my father.
I am standing alone, telling the truth
as you commanded. (Without too many
of the unseemly details, like the sounds of you in bed
sucking, I thought, on fruit I later would not eat.)
You, less than a seed of a wild grape. 
Today, in the last moments of light
I heard a fish, a “Musky,” your nickname, break water.
As I sing my song of how you
will be remembered, if I could
out of misericordia, I’d tie you to the mast
and stuff your ears with wax. I regret
some parts of the body forgive, some don’t. Father,
do not forget your 18 inch Board of Education ruler
on which I measured my penis, marking its progress.
You kept it on your desk before you till your old age.
One reason, perhaps, for the archaic Greek smile
I wore on my face through boyhood.
I never thought I’d dig your grave with laughter.

But that which most I wonder at, which most I did esteem my bliss, which most I boast, And ever shall enjoy, is that within I felt no stain, nor spot of sin.  No darkness then did overshade,       But all within was pure and bright, No guilt did crush, nor fear invade       But all my soul was full of light.  A joyful sense and purity       Is all I can remember;    The very night to me was bright,       ’Twas summer in December.  A serious meditation did employ My soul within, which taken up with joy Did seem no outward thing to note, but fly All objects that do feed the eye.  While it those very objects did       Admire, and prize, and praise, and love, Which in their glory most are hid,       Which presence only doth remove.        Their constant daily presence I Rejoicing at, did see;       And that which takes them from the eye Of others, offer’d them to me.  No inward inclination did I feel To avarice or pride: my soul did kneel In admiration all the day. No lust, nor strife, Polluted then my infant life.  No fraud nor anger in me mov’d,       No malice, jealousy, or spite; All that I saw I truly lov’d.       Contentment only and delight        Were in my soul. O Heav’n! what bliss Did I enjoy and feel!       What powerful delight did this Inspire! for this I daily kneel.  Whether it be that nature is so pure, And custom only vicious; or that sure God did by miracle the guilt remove, And make my soul to feel his love  So early: or that ’twas one day,       Wherein this happiness I found; Whose strength and brightness so do ray,       That still it seems me to surround;  What ere it is, it is a light       So endless unto me That I a world of true delight       Did then and to this day do see.  That prospect was the gate of Heav’n, that day The ancient light of Eden did convey Into my soul: I was an Adam there A little Adam in a sphere  Of joys! O there my ravish’d sense       Was entertain’d in Paradise, And had a sight of innocence       Which was beyond all bound and price.  An antepast of Heaven sure!       I on the earth did reign; Within, without me, all was pure;       I must become a child again.

I laid myself down as a woman
And woke as a child.
Sleep buried me up to my chin,
But my brain cut wild. 
Sudden summer lay sticky as tar
Under bare white feet.
Stale, soot-spotted heapings of winter
Shrank in the street. 
Black headlines, infolded like napkins,
Crashed like grenades
As war beat its way porch by porch
Up New Haven's façades. 
Europe: a brown hive of noises,
Hitler inside.
On the sunny shelf by the stairs
My tadpoles died. 
Big boys had already decided
Who'd lose and who'd score,
Singing one potato, two potato,
Three potato, four. 
Singing sticks and stones
May break my bones
(but names hurt more). 
Singing step on a crack
Break your mother's back
(her platinum-ringed finger). 
Singing who got up your mother
When your daddy wasn't there?
Singing allee allee in free! You're
Dead, you're dead, wherever you are!

That hour-glass-backed,
orchard-legged,
heavy-headed will, 
paper-folded,
wedge-contorted,
savage—dense to kill— 
pulls back on backward-moving,
arching
high legs still, 
lowered through a deep, knees-reaching,
feathered down
green will, 
antenna-honest,
thread-descending,
carpeted as if with skill, 
a focus-changing,
sober-reaching, 
tracing, killing will.

In those days I thought their endless thrum
   was the great wheel that turned the days, the nights.
      In the throats of hibiscus and oleander 
I’d see them clustered yellow, blue, their shells
   enameled hard as the sky before the rain.
      All that summer, my second, from city 
to city my young father drove the black coupe
   through humid mornings I’d wake to like fever
      parceled between luggage and sample goods. 
Afternoons, showers drummed the roof,
   my parents silent for hours. Even then I knew
      something of love was cruel, was distant. 
Mother leaned over the seat to me, the orchid
   Father’d pinned in her hair shriveled
      to a purple fist. A necklace of shells 
coiled her throat, moving a little as she
   murmured of alligators that float the rivers
      able to swallow a child whole, of mosquitoes 
whose bite would make you sleep a thousand years.
   And always the trance of blacktop shimmering
      through swamps with names like incantations— 
Okeefenokee, where Father held my hand
   and pointed to an egret’s flight unfolding
      white above swamp reeds that sang with insects 
until I was lost, until I was part
   of the singing, their thousand wings gauze
      on my body, tattooing my skin. 
Father rocked me later by the water,
   the motel balcony, singing calypso
      with the Jamaican radio. The lyrics 
a net over the sea, its lesson
   of desire and repetition. Lizards flashed
      over his shoes, over the rail 
where the citronella burned merging our
   shadows—Father’s face floating over mine
      in the black changing sound 
of night, the enormous Florida night,
   metallic with cicadas, musical
      and dangerous as the human heart.

With the body of a morbid hanging doll
my aura burns
by shifts
by ambles
by mirages 
by the sun in its primordial morass
summoned from a spectral locust feast 
through electric bartering grammes
living
as if a spectrum had been transmogrified
across the sum of exploded solar windows
amidst motions of viral infamy
of sudden discharge pontoons
of magical lyncean sails above ships of pure vitrescence 
enthralled
by empty Minoan game dogs
debating oxygen as form
debating menace as ideal
as one listens to fire
in dense eruptional gullet
in hanging hydrogen mirrors
so that each image is shifted
back & forth
between gales & the apparition of gales 
so that
unicorns from Çatal Hüyük
cease to condense as forms of the earth
but take on the body of enigma as transparence
as blackened meteor in abstraction 
the sun no longer quantified
by strange calendrical posses
but becomes
balletic differential
which ceases to quarrel
with the magic of fragment as schism 
as mist
as a power cast before oasis 
because the game dogs
the unicorn mirrors
spun as a wakeless ocular thirst
as a conjured distance
evolved from the force of a clarified activity 
like darkened water as shock
as scale which looms as humidity
then the eyes always focused
as pleas for hushed exhibits

As I sit looking out of a window of the building
I wish I did not have to write the instruction manual on the uses of a new metal.
I look down into the street and see people, each walking with an inner peace,   
And envy them—they are so far away from me!
Not one of them has to worry about getting out this manual on schedule.   
And, as my way is, I begin to dream, resting my elbows on the desk and leaning out of the window a little,
Of dim Guadalajara! City of rose-colored flowers!
City I wanted most to see, and most did not see, in Mexico!
But I fancy I see, under the press of having to write the instruction manual,   
Your public square, city, with its elaborate little bandstand!
The band is playing Scheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov.
Around stand the flower girls, handing out rose- and lemon-colored flowers,   
Each attractive in her rose-and-blue striped dress (Oh! such shades of rose and blue),
And nearby is the little white booth where women in green serve you green and yellow fruit.
The couples are parading; everyone is in a holiday mood.
First, leading the parade, is a dapper fellow
Clothed in deep blue. On his head sits a white hat
And he wears a mustache, which has been trimmed for the occasion.
His dear one, his wife, is young and pretty; her shawl is rose, pink, and white.   
Her slippers are patent leather, in the American fashion,
And she carries a fan, for she is modest, and does not want the crowd to see her face too often.
But everybody is so busy with his wife or loved one
I doubt they would notice the mustachioed man’s wife.
Here come the boys! They are skipping and throwing little things on the sidewalk
Which is made of gray tile. One of them, a little older, has a toothpick in his teeth.
He is silenter than the rest, and affects not to notice the pretty young girls in white.
But his friends notice them, and shout their jeers at the laughing girls.   
Yet soon all this will cease, with the deepening of their years,
And love bring each to the parade grounds for another reason.
But I have lost sight of the young fellow with the toothpick.
Wait—there he is—on the other side of the bandstand,
Secluded from his friends, in earnest talk with a young girl
Of fourteen or fifteen. I try to hear what they are saying
But it seems they are just mumbling something—shy words of love, probably.
She is slightly taller than he, and looks quietly down into his sincere eyes.   
She is wearing white. The breeze ruffles her long fine black hair against her olive cheek.
Obviously she is in love. The boy, the young boy with the toothpick, he is in love too;
His eyes show it. Turning from this couple,
I see there is an intermission in the concert.
The paraders are resting and sipping drinks through straws
(The drinks are dispensed from a large glass crock by a lady in dark blue),   
And the musicians mingle among them, in their creamy white uniforms, and talk
About the weather, perhaps, or how their kids are doing at school. 
Let us take this opportunity to tiptoe into one of the side streets.   
Here you may see one of those white houses with green trim   
That are so popular here. Look—I told you!
It is cool and dim inside, but the patio is sunny.
An old woman in gray sits there, fanning herself with a palm leaf fan.   
She welcomes us to her patio, and offers us a cooling drink.   
“My son is in Mexico City,” she says. “He would welcome you too   
If he were here. But his job is with a bank there.
Look, here is a photograph of him.”
And a dark-skinned lad with pearly teeth grins out at us from the worn leather frame.
We thank her for her hospitality, for it is getting late
And we must catch a view of the city, before we leave, from a good high place.
That church tower will do—the faded pink one, there against the fierce blue of the sky. Slowly we enter.
The caretaker, an old man dressed in brown and gray, asks us how long we have been in the city, and how we like it here.
His daughter is scrubbing the steps—she nods to us as we pass into the tower.
Soon we have reached the top, and the whole network of the city extends before us.
There is the rich quarter, with its houses of pink and white, and its crumbling, leafy terraces.
There is the poorer quarter, its homes a deep blue.
There is the market, where men are selling hats and swatting flies
And there is the public library, painted several shades of pale green and beige.
Look! There is the square we just came from, with the promenaders.   
There are fewer of them, now that the heat of the day has increased,   
But the young boy and girl still lurk in the shadows of the bandstand.   
And there is the home of the little old lady—
She is still sitting in the patio, fanning herself.
How limited, but how complete withal, has been our experience of Guadalajara!
We have seen young love, married love, and the love of an aged mother for her son.
We have heard the music, tasted the drinks, and looked at colored houses.   
What more is there to do, except stay? And that we cannot do.
And as a last breeze freshens the top of the weathered old tower, I turn my
gaze
Back to the instruction manual which has made me dream of Guadalajara.

Always just one demon in the attic.
Always just one death in the village. And the dogs
howling in that direction. And from the other end
the new-born child arrives, the only one
to fill the empty space in that wide air. 
Likewise also cells infected by a virus
send out a signal all around them and defences
are mobilised so that no other virus
has any hope just then of taking root
or changing fate. This phenomenon
is known as interference. 
And when a poet dies in the depth of night
a single black bird wakens in the thicket
and sings for all it is worth
while from the sky a black rain trickles down
like sperm or something,
the song is spattered and the choking bird
sings sitting on an empty rib-cage
in which an imaginary heart
awakes to its forever interfering
futility. And in the morning the sky is clear,
the bird is weary and the soil is fertilised.
The poet is no more. 
In Klatovy Street, in Pilsen,
by the railway bridge, there was
a shop with quilted bedcovers.
In times when there’s a greater need
for a steel cover over our continent
business in quilted bedcovers
is slack. The shopkeeper was hard up.
Practical men when hard up usually
turn to art.
In his shopwindow, open to the interior
of his shop, its owner built
a gingerbread house of quilts
and every evening staged
a performance about a quilted
gingerbread house and a red-quilted
Little Red Riding Hood, while his wife
in this quilted masquerade was alternately
the wolf or the witch, and he himself
a padded-out Hansel,
or Gretel, Red Riding Hood or grandmother.
The sight of the two old people
crawling about in swollen billows
of textiles round the chubby cottage
was not unambiguous. It was a little like
the life of sea cucumbers in the mud
under a reef. Outside thundered
the approaching surf of war and they
conducted their quilted
pantomime outside time and action. 
For a while children would stand outside but
soon they would go home. Nothing was sold.
But it was the only pantomime
at that time. The black bird sang
and rain poured into a rib-cage
wearing the Star of David. 
But in the actors under those quilted covers l'anima allegra must have just then awoken
and so, sweating and rapt, they acted
their undersea commedia dell’arte,
thinking there was a backstage until
a scene was finished, jerkily they moved
from shopwindow to gingerbread house and back,
with the exuberance of Columbines
stricken by polio, while the music
of fifes and drums did not reach them. 
Or else they thought that such a deep
humiliation of the customary dignity of age
interfered with the steps of gentlemen
in leather coats and with
the departure of trains to human slaughterhouses.
It did. 
The black bird sang and the ruined
sclerotic hearts leapt in their breasts,
and then one morning when they didn’t play
and had not even raised the blind -
the sky was clear, the soil was fertilised -
the quilted bedcovers were confiscated
for the eastern front and the actors
transferred to the backstage
of the world, called Bergen-Belsen.
No trace is left of the shop today:
it’s now a greengrocer’s with woody parsnips. 
Always just one death in the village.
Always just one demon.
Great is the power of the theatre, even if
it always does get knocked down in the end
and flung backstage. 
The dogs howl in that direction.
And the butterfly pursues the man
who stole the flowers. 
When we did autopsies at the psychiatric
hospital in Bohnice, filled with the
urban exudations of relative futility,
the car would tip us out amidst the ward blocks
whose inmates waved from windows
with some kind of May Day pennants, and then
one went, hugely alone,
beyond a spinney to the solitary morgue, where
the naked bodies of ancient schizophrenics
awaited us, along with two live inmates; one of them
would pull the corpses up from underground
with a rope hoist and place them
upon the tables as a mother might an infant
for baptism, while the other was lurking, pen ready poised,
in a dark corner to write up
the Latin protocol, and he wrote faultlessly.
Neither of them uttered the slightest sound, only
the hoist shaft moaned...and the knife
drawn over skin and dermis made a sound
of satin tearing...and they were always
enormous and unprecedented pneumonias
and tumours big as dragons’ eggs,
it rained into the open thorax -
and in that roaring silence one had to
break the line of an angel’s fall
and dictate the logical verdict
on a long-sentenced demon...
and the schizophrenic’s pen in the corner
busily scraped across the paper
like an eager mouse. 
We need no prompters
said the puppets haughtily. 
The air of that anatomical theatre
was filled with interferon,
it was a great personal demonstration
against malignant growth, it was
a general amnesty for the walls, entropy
was abjured for the moment 
because there are no bubbles at the bottom
to burst under the breeze. 
The red balloon outside rose up
to an unsuspected sky, its chains
strained by the certainty that the nearer the inferno
the greater the paradise,
the nearer the prison cell
the greater the freedom. Cantabit vacuus coran latrone viator. 
And that is the weird essence of the theatre
that an actor stripped of everything mounts to
the very top of the conflagration
and everything else dies down, falls silent
like a long-hunted animal, its muscles
still twitching but with endorphines
and an infinite peace in the brain. 
Yes, even a whale will sometimes leave the school,
hurl itself into shallow water and perish in the sun
like a levelled cathedral, with pushed-out penis,
and death is instantly buried
in a grain of sand
and the sea laughs. 
Go ask the tree-stumps; in broken language
they preach about saplings. And in the jargon
of galactic white dwarfs the stars
of the main sequence shine forever. 
In the non-Euclidean curved space,
which eludes understanding as much as
the interference of the theatre,
you ceaselessly hear the voices of children
from the primary school of death,
children from the puppet tragedies of the kitchen
and children from the junketings of war,
when skewering them on lances
with their wriggling little legs
provided spice like curry for the mercenaries,
voices of children eluding understanding - 
But we’ve washed behind our ears,
we’ve stopped pulling the cat’s tail,
we’ve stopped shoving our fingers
into electric sockets - 
What else is there left in the universe
of hominisation, slow as the decay of tritium,
than the doctrine of the growing sense of shame of demons:
since Aztec times high priests no longer
offer up sacrifice while dressed in the skin
of a freshly flayed prisoner. 
We need no prompters, they said - 
Once on St Nicholas’ Day, the man acting the Devil,
dead drunk, fell down some stairs and lay there,
and a child, experiencing that embarrassing
joy mere inches from terror,
ran out after the thump and called: 
Mummy, come here, there’s a dead devil - 
And so he was, even though the actor
picked himself up after another tot. Maybe the dogs howled,
but only by a black mistake.
In the sky shone the stars of the main sequence,
the bird was getting ready in the thicket,
the child shivered a little
from the chill of three million years,
in that wide air, but
they prompted him, poetically, 
you’re only imagining all this,
look, the butterfly’s already
bringing the flowers back...and
there’s no other devil left...and
the nearer paradise... 
He believed, and yet he didn’t.

(Lord Egremont speaks)



It was a way of punishing the house, setting it ablaze
in ruddy, golden flames; smoke
in billows up the front stairs; walls
cringing like leaves.   
I say, I am afraid
in my own house. Do not believe I started this, it was
that man, who was to portray the park alone, mind you,
but then became
enamored of the music room.
And now what have we: floods
of fire rolling from room to room, furniture wrecked
in seethe, my wife   
Lady Amelia turned
wraith, God knows what fish
and drowning slaves cast up in the tide
along with pocket Bibles, snuffboxes, antimacassars, the   
familiar bric-a-brac of the well-kept house.
Where are Edward, Lavinia, Jane? Why
is no one crying, “Fire! Fire!”? Am I
alone?
         The man has no sense of proportion.
He had himself lashed to the mast, once, it is said,
on a steamboat off the harbor mouth
in full blizzard: sailors blinded by snow, the boat
crippled, led by the lead, they damn near died to a man, and he—
he was observing “the light at sea,” he said.
The painting? “Soapsuds and whitewash,”   
the critics described it so. 
But here, in our house, it is catastrophe   
of flame, not weather, he loosed.
He is a man
in love with last things, clearly, the last things, but
never understood the first, it seems to me,   
and certainly not the genial medias res
of decorous, daily life.
What tea-times we’ve known in these chambers, what sonatinas, lieder of an evening, whist,
Emmeline embroidering, the hounds calm at the hearth, now all
dissolved.
               Perhaps there are no flames.   
A bloody haze arises, it could be
my own eyes that fail.
I hear nothing, but fear
the upstairs rooms, cramped rooms
I have not entered in ages, only remember
the draughts, creakings, grime in closet corners,   
windows too tight to lean from, the smell   
of antique damp. And now, who knows   
what acts unroll
on narrow beds, on floorboards warped askew?
As steam is rising, rising? As heat
buoys the house up into an atmosphere   
all of its own creation?
Who are
the participants? Where has Amelia gone?   
Why, in this furnace, can I hear no sound,   
or feel my own skin begin to peel?

Little green involute fronds of fern at creekside.
And the sinewy clear water rushing over creekstone
of the palest amber, veined with a darker gold,
thinnest lines of gold rivering through the amber
like—ah, now we come to it. We were not put on earth,
the old man said, he was hacking into the crust
of a sourdough half loaf in his vehement, impatient way
with an old horn-handled knife, to express ourselves.
I knew he had seen whole cities leveled: also
that there had been a time of shame for him, outskirts
of a ruined town, half Baroque, half Greek Revival,
pediments of Flora and Hygeia from a brief eighteenth-century
health spa boom lying on the streets in broken chunks
and dogs scavenging among them. His one act of courage
then had been to drop pieces of bread or chocolate,
as others did, where a fugitive family of Jews
was rumored to be hiding. I never raised my voice,
of course, none of us did.

The ladies men admire, I’ve heard,
Would shudder at a wicked word.
Their candle gives a single light;
They’d rather stay at home at night.
They do not keep awake till three,
Nor read erotic poetry.
They never sanction the impure,
Nor recognize an overture.
They shrink from powders and from paints ...
So far, I’ve had no complaints.

this South American up here on a Gugg
walked in with his whore
and she sat on the edge of my bed and
crossed her fine legs
and I kept looking at her legs
and he pulled at his stringy necktie
and I had a hangover
and he asked me
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE AMERICAN
POETS?
and I told him I didn’t think very much
of the American poets
and then he went on to ask some other
very dull questions
(as his whore’s legs layed along the side of
my brain) like
WELL? YOU DON’T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING
BUT IF YOU WERE TEACHING A CLASS AND ONE OF THE
STUDENTS ASKED YOU WHICH AMERICAN POETS
THEY SHOULD READ
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM?
she crossed her legs as I watched and I thought
I could knock him out with one punch
rape her in 4 minutes
catch a train for L.A.
get off in Arizona and walk off into the desert
and I couldn’t tell him that I would never teach
a class
that along with not liking American poetry
that I didn’t like American classes either
or the job that they would expect me to
do,
so I said
Whitman, T.S. Eliot, D.H. Lawrence’ poems about
reptiles and beasts, Auden. and then I
realized that Whitman was the only true American,
that Eliot was not an American somehow and the
others certainly not, and
he knew it too
he knew that I had fucked up
but I made no apologies
thought some more about rape
I almost loved the woman but I knew that when she walked out
that I would never see her again
and we shook hands and the Gugg said
he’d send me the article when it came out
but I knew that he didn’t have an article
and he knew it too
and then he said
I will send you some of my poems translated into
English
and I said fine
and I watched them walk out of the place
I watched her highheels clack down the tall
green steps
and then both of them were gone
but I kept remembering her dress sliding all over her
like a second skin
and I was wild with mourning and love and sadness
and being a fool unable to
communicate
anything
and I walked in and finished that beer
cracked another
put on my ragged king’s coat
and walked out into the New Orleans street
and that very night
I sat with my friends and acted vile and
the ass
much mouth and villainy
and cruelness
and they never
knew why.

Winter
throws his great white shield
on the ground,
breaking thin arms of twisting branches,
and then howls
on the north side of the Black Mesa
a deep, throaty laughter.
Because of him
we have to sell our cattle
that rake snow for stubble.
Having lived his whole life
in a few weeks,
slow and pensive he walks away,
dragging his silver-stream shield
down branches
and over the ground,
he keeps walking slowly away
into death
bravely.

Did I, my lines intend for public view,How many censures, would their faults pursue,Some would, because such words they do affect,Cry they’re insipid, empty, and uncorrect.And many have attained, dull and untaught,The name of wit only by finding fault.True judges might condemn their want of wit,And all might say, they’re by a woman writ.Alas! a woman that attempts the pen,Such an intruder on the rights of men,Such a presumptuous creature, is esteemed,The fault can by no virtue be redeemed.They tell us we mistake our sex and way;Good breeding, fashion, dancing, dressing, playAre the accomplishments we should desire;To write, or read, or think, or to inquireWould cloud our beauty, and exhaust our time,And interrupt the conquests of our prime;Whilst the dull manage of a servile houseIs held by some our outmost art, and use.
  Sure ’twas not ever thus, nor are we toldFables, of women that excelled of old;To whom, by the diffusive hand of Heaven Some share of wit, and poetry was given.On that glad day, on which the Ark returned,The holy pledge, for which the land had mourned,The joyful tribes, attend it on the way,The Levites do the sacred charge convey,Whilst various instruments, before it play;Here, holy virgins in the concert joinThe louder notes, to soften, and refine,And with alternate verse complete the hymn divine.Lo! the young Poet, after God’s own heart,By Him inspired, and taught the Muses’ art,Returned from conquest, a bright chorus meets,That sing his slain ten thousand in the streets.In such loud numbers they his acts declare,Proclaim the wonders of his early war,That Saul upon the vast applause does frown,And feels its mighty thunder shake the crown.What, can the threatened judgment now prolong?Half of the kingdom is already gone;The fairest half, whose influence guides the rest,Have David’s empire o’er their hearts confessed.
  A woman here, leads fainting Israel on,She fights, she wins, she triumphs with a song,Devout, majestic, for the subject fit,And far above her arms, exalts her wit;Then, to the peaceful, shady palm withdraws,And rules the rescued nation, with her laws.How are we fall’n, fall’n by mistaken rules?And education’s, more than nature’s fools,Debarred from all improvements of the mind,And to be dull, expected and designed;And if some one would soar above the rest,With warmer fancy, and ambition pressed,So strong th’ opposing faction still appears,The hopes to thrive can ne’er outweigh the fears,Be cautioned then my Muse, and still retired;Nor be despised, aiming to be admired;Conscious of wants, still with contracted wing,To some few friends, and to thy sorrows sing;For groves of laurel thou wert never meant;Be dark enough thy shades, and be thou there content.

After death, my father
practices meticulously
until the Bach is seamless,
spun glass in a dream,
you can no longer tell
where the modulations are,
or the pedal shifts
or the split fingerings . . . 
if he rests
it’s to wind the metronome
or sip his cup of ice . . . 
but who is the other old man
in the identical flannel gown,
head cocked, listening
ever more critically,
deeper in the empty room?

after Jean Follain



In the evenings they listen to the same
tunes nobody could call happy
somebody turns up at the edge of town
the roses bloom
and an old dinner bell rings once more
under the thunder clouds
In front of the porch posts of the store
a man seated on a soda water case
turns around and spits and says
to everybody
in his new set of clothes
holding up his hands
as long as I live nobody
touches my dogs my friends

La poesie vit d’insomnie perpetuelle
—René Char



There’s a sickness in me. During   
the night I wake up & it’s brought 
a stain into my mouth, as if
an ocean has risen & left back 
a stink on the rocks of my teeth.   
I stink. My mouth is ugly, human 
stink. A color like rust
is in me. I can’t get rid of it. 
It rises after I
brush my teeth, a taste 
like iron. In the
night, left like a dream, 
a caustic light
washing over the insides of me.  * 
What to do with my arms? They   
coil out of my body 
like snakes.
They branch & spit. 
I want to shake myself   
until they fall like withered 
roots; until
they bend the right way— 
until I fit in them,   
or they in me. 
I have to lay them down as   
carefully as an old wedding dress, 
I have to fold them
like the arms of someone dead. 
The house is quiet; all   
night I struggle. All 
because of my arms,   
which have no peace!  * 
I’m a martyr, a girl who’s been dead   
two thousand years. I turn 
on my left side, like one comfortable   
after a long, hard death. 
The angels look down
tenderly. “She’s sleeping,” they say 
& pass me by. But
all night, I am passing 
in & out of my body   
on my naked feet.  * 
I’m awake when I’m sleeping & I’m   
sleeping when I’m awake, & no one 
knows, not even me, for my eyes   
are closed to myself. 
I think I am thinking I see
a man beside me, & he thinks 
in his sleep that I’m awake   
writing. I hear a pen scratch 
a paper. There is some idea   
I think is clever: I want to 
capture myself in a book.  * 
I have to make a   
place for my body in 
my body. I’m like a   
dog pawing a blanket 
on the floor. I have to   
turn & twist myself 
like a rag until I
can smell myself in myself. 
I’m sweating; the water is   
pouring out of me 
like silver. I put my head   
in the crook of my arm 
like a brilliant moon.  * 
The bones of my left foot   
are too heavy on the bones 
of my right. They
lie still for a little while, 
sleeping, but soon they   
bruise each other like 
angry twins. Then
the bones of my right foot 
command the bones of my left   
to climb down.

Come when the nights are bright with stars
Or come when the moon is mellow;
Come when the sun his golden bars
Drops on the hay-field yellow.
Come in the twilight soft and gray,
Come in the night or come in the day,
Come, O love, whene’er you may,
And you are welcome, welcome. 
You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,
You are soft as the nesting dove.
Come to my heart and bring it to rest
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest. 
Come when my heart is full of grief
Or when my heart is merry;
Come with the falling of the leaf
Or with the redd’ning cherry.
Come when the year’s first blossom blows,
Come when the summer gleams and glows,
Come with the winter’s drifting snows,
And you are welcome, welcome.

Tonight, grave sir, both my poor house, and I Do equally desire your company; Not that we think us worthy such a guest, But that your worth will dignify our feast With those that come, whose grace may make that seem Something, which else could hope for no esteem. It is the fair acceptance, sir, creates The entertainment perfect, not the cates. Yet shall you have, to rectify your palate, An olive, capers, or some better salad Ushering the mutton; with a short-legged hen, If we can get her, full of eggs, and then Lemons, and wine for sauce; to these a cony Is not to be despaired of, for our money; And, though fowl now be scarce, yet there are clerks, The sky not falling, think we may have larks. I’ll tell you of more, and lie, so you will come: Of partridge, pheasant, woodcock, of which some May yet be there, and godwit, if we can; Knat, rail, and ruff too. Howsoe’er, my man Shall read a piece of Virgil, Tacitus, Livy, or of some better book to us, Of which we’ll speak our minds, amidst our meat; And I’ll profess no verses to repeat. To this, if ought appear which I not know of, That will the pastry, not my paper, show of.Digestive cheese and fruit there sure will be; But that which most doth take my Muse and me, Is a pure cup of rich Canary wine, Which is the Mermaid’s now, but shall be mine; Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted, Their lives, as so their lines, till now had lasted. Tobacco, nectar, or the Thespian spring, Are all but Luther's beer to this I sing. Of this we will sup free, but moderately, And we will have no Pooley, or Parrot by, Nor shall our cups make any guilty men; But, at our parting we will be as when We innocently met. No simple word That shall be uttered at our mirthful board, Shall make us sad next morning or affright The liberty that we’ll enjoy tonight.

This morning a cat—bright orange—pawing at the one patch of new grass in the sand-and tanbark-colored leaves. 
And last night the sapphire of the raccoon's eyes in the beam of the flashlight.
He was climbing a tree beside the house, trying to get onto the porch, I think, for a wad of oatmeal
Simmered in cider from the bottom of the pan we'd left out for the birds. 
And earlier a burnished, somewhat dazed woodchuck, his coat gleaming with spring,
Loping toward his burrow in the roots of a tree among the drying winter's litter
Of old leaves on the floor of the woods, when I went out to get the New York Times. 
And male cardinals whistling back and forth—sireeep, sreeep, sreeep—
Sets of three sweet full notes, weaving into and out of each other like the triplet rhymes in medieval poetry,
And the higher, purer notes of the tufted titmice among them,
High in the trees where they were catching what they could of the early sun. 
And a doe and two yearlings, picking their way along the worrying path they'd made through the gully, their coats the color of the forest floor,
Stopped just at the roots of the great chestnut where the woodchuck's burrow was,
Froze, and the doe looked back over her shoulder at me for a long moment, and leapt forward,
Her young following, and bounded with that almost mincing precision in the landing of each hoof
Up the gully, over it, and out of sight. So that I remembered
Dreaming last night that a deer walked into the house while I was writing at the kitchen table,
Came in the glass door from the garden, looked at me with a stilled defiant terror, like a thing with no choices,
And, neck bobbing in that fragile-seeming, almost mechanical mix of arrest and liquid motion, came to the table
And snatched a slice of apple, and stood, and then quietened, and to my surprise did not leave again. 
And those little captains, the chickadees, swift to the feeder and swift away. 
And the squirrels with their smoke-plume tails trailing digging in the leaves to bury or find buried—
I'm told they don't remember where they put things, that it's an activity of incessant discovery—
Nuts, tree-fall proteins, whatever they forage from around the house of our leavings, 
And the flameheaded woodpecker at the suet with his black-and-white ladderback elegant fierceness—
They take sunflower seeds and stash them in the rough ridges of the tree's bark
Where the beaks of the smoke-and-steel blue nuthatches can't quite get at them—
Though the nuthatches sometimes seem to get them as they con the trees methodically for spiders' eggs or some other overwintering insect's intricately packaged lump of futurity
Got from its body before the cold came on. 
And the little bat in the kitchen lightwell—
When I climbed on a chair to remove the sheet of wimpled plastic and let it loose,
It flew straight into my face and I toppled to the floor, chair under me,
And it flared down the hall and did what seemed a frantic reconnoiter of the windowed, high-walled living room.
And lit on a brass firelog where it looked like a brown and ash
grey teenaged suede glove with Mephistophelean dreams,
And then, spurt of black sperm, up, out the window, and into the twilight woods. 
All this life going on about my life, or living a life about all this life going on,
Being a creature, whatever my drama of the moment, at the edge of the raccoon's world—
He froze in my flashlight beam and looked down, no affect, just looked,
The ringtail curled and flared to make him look bigger and not to be messed with—
I was thinking he couldn't know how charming his comic-book robber's mask was to me,
That his experience of his being and mine of his and his of mine were things entirely apart,
Though there were between us, probably, energies of shrewd and respectful tact, based on curiosity and fear—
I knew about his talons whatever he knew about me—
And as for my experience of myself, it comes and goes, I'm not sure it's any one thing, as my experience of these creatures is not,
And I know I am often too far from it or too near, glad to be rid of it which is why it was such a happiness,
The bright orange of the cat, and the first pool of green grass-leaves in early April, and the birdsong—that orange and that green not colors you'd set next to one another in the human scheme. 
And the crows' calls, even before you open your eyes, at sunup.

what more can man desire?



Always, he woke in those days
With a sense of treasure,
His heart a gayer glow
Than his window grand with sun,
As a child, its mind all whirring
With green and hollied pleasure
Wakes in a haze of Christmas!
The season of secrets done. 
Or as one on country linen
Wakes with a start one morning—
Then on comfort snugger than pillows
Floats: July at the lake.
Or has married a golden girl
And can hardly believe, but turning
Sees blossom for him that very face
Worshipping cameras take. 
Toy trains whirr perky on
Till springs contort beneath;
The middle-age rower slumps
Like a sack—indignant seizure!
Late editions wail Screen Star in Mystery Death—
Yet in those same days
He woke with a sense of treasure. 
Knowing: my love is safe
Though the Rockies plunge like water,
Though surf like a wildfire rage
And omens roam the sky;
Though limbs of the swimmer laze
Pale where the seaweed caught her,
Nothing can touch my love
As dangerous time goes by.

The natives here enjoy a delicate
      and tense society.
   Their upper classes make an art
         of conversation 
so refined that no Caucasian ever
      participates without
   making at least one outrageous
         faux pas. 
Few Europeans, in fact, can manage
      even the rudiments
   of this language, which consists
         of vowels only, 
and, although several grammars have been composed
      by reputable scholars,
   these disagree on every major
         point of syntax. 
The chieftains are invariably stout:
      a proverb says “Fat men must
   be sure; doubt and misgivings need
         agility.” 
The special term for this is rendered as
      “complacency” in all
   the lexicons, but is in no wise
         derogatory.

And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lute, and who has the sweetest voice of all God’s creatures. —KORAN



In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
   “Whose heart-strings are a lute”;   
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel,
And the giddy stars (so legends tell),   
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell   
   Of his voice, all mute. 
Tottering above
   In her highest noon,
   The enamoured moon
Blushes with love,
   While, to listen, the red levin   
   (With the rapid Pleiads, even,   
   Which were seven,)
   Pauses in Heaven. 
And they say (the starry choir   
   And the other listening things)   
That Israfeli’s fire
Is owing to that lyre
   By which he sits and sings—   
The trembling living wire
   Of those unusual strings. 
But the skies that angel trod,
   Where deep thoughts are a duty,   
Where Love’s a grown-up God,
   Where the Houri glances are   
Imbued with all the beauty
   Which we worship in a star. 
Therefore, thou art not wrong,   
   Israfeli, who despisest
An unimpassioned song;
To thee the laurels belong,
   Best bard, because the wisest!   
Merrily live, and long! 
The ecstasies above
   With thy burning measures suit—   
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
   With the fervour of thy lute—
   Well may the stars be mute! 
Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
   Is a world of sweets and sours;
   Our flowers are merely—flowers,   
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
   Is the sunshine of ours. 
If I could dwell
Where Israfel
   Hath dwelt, and he where I,
He might not sing so wildly well
   A mortal melody,
While a bolder note than this might swell   
   From my lyre within the sky.

Somebody said that it couldn’t be done
      But he with a chuckle replied
That “maybe it couldn’t,” but he would be one
      Who wouldn’t say so till he’d tried.
So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin
      On his face. If he worried he hid it.
He started to sing as he tackled the thing
      That couldn’t be done, and he did it! 
Somebody scoffed: “Oh, you’ll never do that;
      At least no one ever has done it;”
But he took off his coat and he took off his hat
      And the first thing we knew he’d begun it.
With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,
      Without any doubting or quiddit,
He started to sing as he tackled the thing
      That couldn’t be done, and he did it. 
There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,
      There are thousands to prophesy failure,
There are thousands to point out to you one by one,
      The dangers that wait to assail you.
But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,
      Just take off your coat and go to it;
Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing
      That “cannot be done,” and you’ll do it.

If you had a lot of money
(by some coincidence
you’re at the Nassau Inn in Princeton
getting a whiff of class)
and you just noticed two days ago
that your face has fallen,
but you don’t believe it,
so every time you look in the glass
it’s still hanging there where it wasn’t.
Would you take the money you needed
for a new roof on your old house
(the house you’re paying for
over and over in property taxes)
because it’s been leaking for years
and you’re tired of emptying buckets
and spraying for mold,
would you take that money
and get your face lifted?
Face-lift. They cut a slit
under your ears and pull up the slack
and they tack it with plastic.
Then they pull up the outer
skin and trim it because it’s too long and
fasten that. (Your skin
pulls loose from the fat like chicken skin.)
Because once you were almost
as beautiful as Jane Wyman ...
your friends all said that.
Of course at the time she was
married to Ronnie and you were
involved with the ASU—
a McCarthy suspect.
Forget about your neck.
They can’t do that yet.
A face-lift lasts five years.
So you could go on being a member
of new-speak and re-entry—
with the unsung benefits
of radiation and by then
your roof would have rotted anyway.
Or been recycled by some corporate kid.
But think how you’d rather
be stripped and streaked
and while you’re about it
get some implants of baby teeth buds
that they’ve taken from dead babies’ gums
and frozen for this sort of thing.
You could still die young.

These are the streets where we walked with war and childhood
Like our two shadows behind us, or
Before us like one shadow.
                                       River walks
Threaded by park rats, flanked by battleships,
Flickering of a grey tail on the bank,
Motionless hulls
Enormous under a dead grey sky.
Farther, the harbor and the miscolored waters
Rocking their flotsam under the blank round eye
At the masthead staring down the rats to come,
Beyond the fisher gulls.
And the windows full of ropes and hardware,
Doorways, barreled, yawning on the dark,
Wall-eyed alleys, coils of husky smells,
The breath of journeys strong there.
Streets whose sordid beauty
                                        joked readily with hope.
The taller avenues,
And walls that smiled like unpurchased horizons,
Swung intimate views out of a foreign room,
Hung a gate upon a garden's fable,
Walls that frowned
With aged remorseless eyes
Or the gloom of thunderlit landscapes, opening
A door into that placeless country
Where the sad animal is blithe, free and at home.
Too, those halls
Where we stepped lightly among the creatures
Whom death had tamed, who yet crouched, sprang, or flew,
Fierce as hunger, graceful as joy,
Until we knew, as in a half silvered mirror, the half
Captive image of immortality.
These are the old places, and walking there
As then with war and childhood, I look into the shadows' faces.
They appal.
                Yet often I will see
(The marvels floating alive upon that stream,
The breathing of delight like purest air)
Another place: that you contrived
Between midnight and morning
In your dream, and in the morning
Took me there.
                     We greeted it, who could not stay.
But it is there,
Surviving disbelief, surviving even what the malign years prepare.

Tonight my children hunch
Toward their Western, and are glad   
As, with a Sunday punch,
The Good casts out the Bad. 
And in their fairy tales
The warty giant and witch
Get sealed in doorless jails
And the match-girl strikes it rich. 
I’ve made myself a drink.
The giant and witch are set
To bust out of the clink
When my children have gone to bed. 
All frequencies are loud
With signals of despair;
In flash and morse they crowd   
The rondure of the air. 
For the wicked have grown strong,   
Their numbers mock at death,   
Their cow brings forth its young,   
Their bull engendereth. 
Their very fund of strength,   
Satan, bestrides the globe;
He stalks its breadth and length   
And finds out even Job. 
Yet by quite other laws
My children make their case;   
Half God, half Santa Claus,   
But with my voice and face, 
A hero comes to save
The poorman, beggarman, thief,   
And make the world behave   
And put an end to grief. 
And that their sleep be sound   
I say this childermas
Who could not, at one time,   
Have saved them from the gas.

Poem for Sriram Shamasunder
And All of Poetry for the People



It’s a sunlit morning
with jasmine blooming
easily
and a drove of robin redbreasts
diving into the ivy covering
what used to be
a backyard fence
or doves shoving aside
the birch tree leaves
when
a young man walks among
the flowers
to my doorway
where he knocks
then stands still
brilliant in a clean white shirt 
He lifts a soft fist
to that door
and knocks again 
He’s come to say this
was or that
was
not
and what’s
anyone of us to do
about what’s done
what’s past
but prickling salt to sting
our eyes 
What’s anyone of us to do
about what’s done 
And 7-month-old Bingo
puppy leaps
and hits
that clean white shirt
with muddy paw
prints here
and here and there 
And what’s anyone of us to do
about what’s done
I say I’ll wash the shirt
no problem
two times through
the delicate blue cycle
of an old machine
the shirt spins in the soapy
suds and spins in rinse
and spins
and spins out dry 
not clean 
still marked by accidents
by energy of whatever serious or trifling cause
the shirt stays dirty
from that puppy’s paws 
I take that fine white shirt
from India
the threads as soft as baby
fingers weaving them
together
and I wash that shirt
between
between the knuckles of my own
two hands
I scrub and rub that shirt
to take the dirty
markings
out 
At the pocket
and around the shoulder seam
and on both sleeves
the dirt the paw
prints tantalize my soap
my water my sweat
equity
invested in the restoration
of a clean white shirt
         
And on the eleventh try
I see no more
no anything unfortunate
no dirt 
I hold the limp fine
cloth
between the faucet stream
of water as transparent
as a wish the moon stayed out
all day 
How small it has become!
That clean white shirt!
How delicate!
How slight!
How like a soft fist knocking on my door!
And now I hang the shirt
to dry
as slowly as it needs
the air
to work its way
with everything
         
It’s clean.
A clean white shirt
nobody wanted to spoil
or soil
that shirt
much cleaner now but also
not the same
as the first before that shirt
got hit got hurt
not perfect
anymore
just beautiful 
a clean white shirt 
It’s hard to keep a clean shirt clean.

for Peter Parrish



Each morning the man rises from bed because the invisible
cord leading from his neck to someplace in the dark,
the cord that makes him always dissatisfied,
has been wound tighter and tighter until he wakes. 
He greets his family, looking for himself in their eyes,
but instead he sees shorter or taller men, men with
different degrees of anger or love, the kind of men
that people who hardly know him often mistake
for him, leaving a movie or running to catch a bus. 
He has a job that he goes to. It could be at a bank
or a library or turning a piece of flat land
into a ditch. All day something that refuses to
show itself hovers at the corner of his eye,
like a name he is trying to remember, like
expecting a touch on the shoulder, as if someone
were about to embrace him, a woman in a blue dress
whom he has never met, would never meet again.
And it seems the purpose of each day’s labor
is simply to bring this mystery to focus. He can
almost describe it, as if it were a figure at the edge
of a burning field with smoke swirling around it
like white curtains shot full of wind and light. 
When he returns home, he studies the eyes of his family to see
what person he should be that evening. He wants to say:
All day I have been listening, all day I have felt
I stood on the brink of something amazing.
But he says nothing, and his family walks around him
as if he were a stick leaning against a wall. 
Late in the evening the cord around his neck draws him to bed.
He is consoled by the coolness of sheets, pressure
of blankets. He turns to the wall, and as water
drains from a sink so his daily mind slips from him.
Then sleep rises before him like a woman in a blue dress,
and darkness puts its arms around him, embracing him.
Be true to me, it says, each night you belong to me more,
until at last I lift you up and wrap you within me.

It's such a shock, I almost screech,
When I find a worm inside my peach!
But then, what really makes me blue,
Is to find a worm who's bit in two!

It would be neat if with the New Year
I could leave my loneliness behind with the old year.
My leathery loneliness an old pair of work boots
my dog vigorously head-shakes back and forth in its jaws,
chews on for hours every day in my front yard—
rain, sun, snow, or wind
in bare feet, pondering my poem,
I’d look out my window and see that dirty pair of boots in the yard. 
But my happiness depends so much on wearing those boots. 
At the end of my day
while I’m in a chair listening to a Mexican corrido
I stare at my boots appreciating:
all the wrong roads we’ve taken, all the drug and whiskey houses
we’ve visited, and as the Mexican singer wails his pain,
I smile at my boots, understanding every note in his voice,
and strangers, when they see my boots rocking back and forth on my
                                                                                                    feet
keeping beat to the song, see how
my boots are scuffed, tooth-marked, worn-soled. 
I keep wearing them because they fit so good
and I need them, especially when I love so hard,
where I go up those boulder strewn trails,
where flowers crack rocks in their defiant love for the light.

As you set out for Ithaka
hope your road is a long one,
full of adventure, full of discovery.
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:
you’ll never find things like that on your way
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,
as long as a rare excitement
stirs your spirit and your body.
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them
unless you bring them along inside your soul,
unless your soul sets them up in front of you. 
Hope your road is a long one.
May there be many summer mornings when,
with what pleasure, what joy,
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations
to buy fine things,
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,
sensual perfume of every kind—
as many sensual perfumes as you can;
and may you visit many Egyptian cities
to learn and go on learning from their scholars. 
Keep Ithaka always in your mind.
Arriving there is what you’re destined for.
But don’t hurry the journey at all.
Better if it lasts for years,
so you’re old by the time you reach the island,
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich. 
Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.
Without her you wouldn't have set out.
She has nothing left to give you now. 
And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.

Oh, a dainty plant is the Ivy green,That creepeth o’er ruins old!Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,In his cell so lone and cold.The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed,To pleasure his dainty whim:And the mouldering dust that years have madeIs a merry meal for him.
   Creeping where no life is seen,
   A rare old plant is the Ivy green.
Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings,And a staunch old heart has he.How closely he twineth, how tight he clings,To his friend the huge Oak Tree!And slily he traileth along the ground,And his leaves he gently waves,As he joyously hugs and crawleth roundThe rich mould of dead men’s graves.
   Creeping where grim death has been,
   A rare old plant is the Ivy green.
Whole ages have fled and their works decayed,And nations have scattered been;But the stout old Ivy shall never fade,From its hale and hearty green.The brave old plant, in its lonely days,Shall fatten upon the past:For the stateliest building man can raise,Is the Ivy’s food at last.
   Creeping on, where time has been,
   A rare old plant is the Ivy green.

He dwelt among “apartments let,”       About five stories high; A man I thought that none would get,       And very few would try.  A boulder, by a larger stone       Half hidden in the mud, Fair as a man when only one       Is in the neighborhood.  He lived unknown, and few could tell       When Jacob was not free; But he has got a wife,—and O!       The difference to me!

The popcorn is greasy, and I forgot to bring a Kleenex.   
A pill that’s a bomb inside the stomach of a man inside 
The Embassy blows up. Eructations of flame, luxurious   
cauliflowers giganticize into motion. The entire 29-ft. 
screen is orange, is crackling flesh and brick bursting,   
blackening, smithereened. I unwrap a Dentyne and, while 
jouncing my teeth in rubber tongue-smarting clove, try   
with the 2-inch-wide paper to blot butter off my fingers. 
A bubble-bath, room-sized, in which 14 girls, delectable   
and sexless, twist-topped Creamy Freezes (their blond, 
red, brown, pinkish, lavendar or silver wiglets all   
screwed that high, and varnished), scrub-tickle a lone 
male, whose chest has just the right amount and distribu-
tion of curly hair. He’s nervously pretending to defend 
his modesty. His crotch, below the waterline, is also
below the frame—but unsubmerged all 28 slick foamy boobs. 
Their makeup fails to let the girls look naked. Caterpil-
lar lashes, black and thick, lush lips glossed pink like 
the gum I pop and chew, contact lenses on the eyes that are   
mostly blue, they’re nose-perfect replicas of each other. 
I’ve got most of the grease off and onto this little square   
of paper. I’m folding it now, making creases with my nails.

I went to his sixty-sixth birthday
dinner: sixteen years ago this past
November. I remember that it was at
Chelsea Central (his favorite restaurant:
great steaks) on 10th Avenue, and
that Ashbery was there, and a few
others, including Joe, impeccably
dressed and gracious, who picked up
what must have been (I thought
at the time) an exorbitant bill. 
I remember him saying more than
once, “Joe always picks up the bill,”
then smiling a slightly wicked smile. 
Sitting with him (those excruciating
silences!) in his room at the Chelsea,
my eyes would wander from his book-
shelves (The Portrait of a Lady stood out)
to the pan of water on the radiator
to the records strewn on the floor
to some scraggly plants (ivy? herbs?)
in ceramic pots at the base of the French
doors that opened to the balcony and
balustrade and sound of traffic on 23rd
Street six floors below. He read me
“White Boat, Blue Boat” shortly after he
wrote it, and a poem about Brook Benton
singing “Rainy Night in Georgia” that
didn’t make it into his Last Poems, though
I remember thinking it beautiful. He
complained, in a letter to Tom, about
how much I smoked, and how emotional
I’d get during movies: he must have been
referring to Field of Dreams (he had a yen
for Kevin Costner). When he took me
to see L'Atalante, a film he loved, I was
bored. Once, we took the subway (he
hadn’t ridden it in years) to the Frick;
I remember admiring Romney’s Lady
Hamilton. It hurt that he didn’t invite
me to the dinner after his Dia reading
or to the reception after his reading at the
92nd Street Y, though he did, at the latter,
read “Mood Indigo,” dedicated to me.
When he said my name from the stage,
Joan and Eileen, sitting to my left, turned
and stared at me; frozen by the enormity
of the moment, I couldn’t look back.
When he came to a reading I gave at
St. Mark’s, Raymond impressed upon
me what an honor it was: Jimmy didn’t
go to many poetry readings. What else
is there to say? That when I visited him
at St. Vincent’s the day before he died
Darragh said, “He likes to hear gossip.”
So I said, “Eileen and I are talking again.”
That at his funeral I sat alone (Ira couldn’t
come); that that was the loneliest feeling
in the world. That afterwards Doug said
“You look so sad.” How should I have
looked, Doug! And that a year after he
died, I dreamt I saw him in the lobby of
the Chelsea Hotel. He was wearing a
hospital shift and seemed to have no
muscle control over his face—like in inten-
sive care after his stroke. He saw me
and said, “It’s nice to see some familiar
faces.” I approached him, but he
disappeared.

Beautifully Janet slept
Till it was deeply morning. She woke then   
And thought about her dainty-feathered hen,   
To see how it had kept. 
One kiss she gave her mother,
Only a small one gave she to her daddy
Who would have kissed each curl of his shining baby;   
No kiss at all for her brother. 
“Old Chucky, Old Chucky!” she cried,   
Running across the world upon the grass   
To Chucky’s house, and listening. But alas,   
Her Chucky had died. 
It was a transmogrifying bee
Came droning down on Chucky’s old bald head
And sat and put the poison. It scarcely bled,   
But how exceedingly 
And purply did the knot
Swell with the venom and communicate
Its rigour! Now the poor comb stood up straight
But Chucky did not. 
So there was Janet
Kneeling on the wet grass, crying her brown hen   
(Translated far beyond the daughters of men)   
To rise and walk upon it. 
And weeping fast as she had breath
Janet implored us, “Wake her from her sleep!”   
And would not be instructed in how deep   
Was the forgetful kingdom of death.

Pavement slipp’ry, people sneezing, Lords in ermine, beggars freezing; Titled gluttons dainties carving, Genius in a garret starving.  Lofty mansions, warm and spacious; Courtiers cringing and voracious; Misers scarce the wretched heeding; Gallant soldiers fighting, bleeding.  Wives who laugh at passive spouses; Theatres, and meeting-houses; Balls, where simp’ring misses languish; Hospitals, and groans of anguish.  Arts and sciences bewailing; Commerce drooping, credit failing; Placemen mocking subjects loyal; Separations, weddings royal.  Authors who can’t earn a dinner; Many a subtle rogue a winner; Fugitives for shelter seeking; Misers hoarding, tradesmen breaking.  Taste and talents quite deserted; All the laws of truth perverted; Arrogance o’er merit soaring; Merit silently deploring.  Ladies gambling night and morning; Fools the works of genius scorning; Ancient dames for girls mistaken, Youthful damsels quite forsaken.  Some in luxury delighting; More in talking than in fighting; Lovers old, and beaux decrepid; Lordlings empty and insipid.  Poets, painters, and musicians; Lawyers, doctors, politicians: Pamphlets, newspapers, and odes, Seeking fame by diff’rent roads.  Gallant souls with empty purses; Gen’rals only fit for nurses; School-boys, smit with martial spirit, Taking place of vet’ran merit.  Honest men who can’t get places, Knaves who shew unblushing faces; Ruin hasten’d, peace retarded; Candor spurn’d, and art rewarded.

O lord, he said, Japanese women,
real women, they have not forgotten,
bowing and smiling
closing the wounds men have made;
but American women will kill you like they
tear a lampshade,
American women care less than a dime,
they’ve gotten derailed,
they’re too nervous to make good:
always scowling, belly-aching,
disillusioned, overwrought;
but oh lord, say, the Japanese women:
there was this one,
I came home and the door was locked
and when I broke in she broke out the bread knife
and chased me under the bed
and her sister came
and they kept me under that bed for two days,
and when I came out, at last,
she didn’t mention attorneys,
just said, you will never wrong me again,
and I didn’t; but she died on me,
and dying, said, you can wrong me now,
and I did,
but you know, I felt worse then
than when she was living;
there was no voice, no knife,
nothing but little Japanese prints on the wall,
all those tiny people sitting by red rivers
with flying green birds,
and I took them down and put them face down
in a drawer with my shirts,
and it was the first time I realized
that she was dead, even though I buried her;
and some day I’ll take them all out again,
all the tan-faced little people
sitting happily by their bridges and huts
and mountains—
but not right now,
not just yet.

i am a man's head hunched in the road.
i was chosen to speak by the members
of my body. the arm as it pulled away
pointed toward me, the hand opened once
and was gone. 
why and why and why
should i call a white man brother?
who is the human in this place,
the thing that is dragged or the dragger?
what does my daughter say? 
the sun is a blister overhead.
if i were alive i could not bear it.
the townsfolk sing we shall overcome
while hope bleeds slowly from my mouth
into the dirt that covers us all.
i am done with this dust. i am done.

‘The myrtle bush grew shadyDown by the ford.’‘Is it even so?’ said my lady.‘Even so!’ said my lord.‘The leaves are set too thick togetherFor the point of a sword.

I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair,Borne, like a vapor, on the summer air;I see her tripping where the bright streams play,Happy as the daisies that dance on her way.Many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour.Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o’er:Oh! I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair,Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.
I long for Jeanie with the daydawn smile,Radiant in gladness, warm with winning guile;I hear her melodies, like joys gone by,Sighing round my heart o’er the fond hopes that die:—Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain,—Wailing for the lost one that comes not again:Oh! I long for Jeanie, and my heart bows low,Never more to find her where the bright waters flow.
I sigh for Jeanie, but her light form strayedFar from the fond hearts round her native glade;Her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown,Flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone.Now the nodding wild flowers may wither on the shoreWhile her gentle fingers will cull them no more:Oh! I sigh for Jeanie with the light brown hair,Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.

But singe this song, ‘By, by, loullay,’
To drive away all heivynis.”

Moses, from whose loins I sprung, Lit by a lamp in his blood Ten immutable rules, a moon For mutable lampless men.  The blonde, the bronze, the ruddy, With the same heaving blood, Keep tide to the moon of Moses. Then why do they sneer at me?


^^EOP^^

The jewelled steps are already quite white with dew, It is so late that the dew soaks my gauze stockings, And I let down the crystal curtain And watch the moon through the clear autumn.

Oh mighty City of New York! you are wonderful to behold, Your buildings are magnificent, the truth be it told, They were the only thing that seemed to arrest my eye, Because many of them are thirteen storeys high.  And as for Central Park, it is lovely to be seen, Especially in the summer season when its shrubberies and trees are green; And the Burns’ statue is there to be seen, Surrounded by trees, on the beautiful sward so green; Also Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott, Which by Englishmen and Scotchmen will ne’er be forgot.  There the people on the Sabbath-day in thousands resort, All loud, in conversation and searching for sport, Some of them viewing the menagerie of wild beasts there, And also beautiful black swans, I do declare.  And there’s beautiful boats to be seen there, And the joyous shouts of the children do rend the air, While the boats sail along with them o’er Lohengrin Lake, And the fare is five cents for children and adults ten is all they take.  And there’s also summer-house shades and merry-go-rounds, And with the merry laughter of the children the Park resounds During the livelong Sabbath day, Enjoying the merry-go-round play.  Then there’s the elevated railroads, about five storeys high, Which the inhabitants can see and hear night and day passing by, Oh! such a mass of people daily do throng, No less than five hundred thousand daily pass along, And all along the City you can get for five cents, And, believe me, among the passengers there are few discontent.  And the top of the houses are all flat, And in the warm weather the people gather to chat, Besides on the house-tops they dry their clothes, And also many people all night on the house-tops repose.  And numerous ships and steamboats are there to be seen, Sailing along the East River Water so green; ’Tis certainly a most beautiful sight To see them sailing o’er the smooth water day and night.  And Brooklyn Bridge is a very great height, And fills the stranger’s heart with wonder at first sight, But with all its loftiness, I venture to say, For beauty it cannot surpass the new Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay.  And there’s also ten thousand rumsellers there, Oh! wonderful to think, I do declare! To accommodate the people of That city therein, And to encourage them to commit all sorts of sin.  And on the Sabbath-day, ye will see many a man Going for beer with a tin can, And seems proud to be seen carrying home the beer To treat his neighbours and family dear.  Then at night numbers of the people dance and sing, Making the walls of their houses to ring With their songs and dancing on Sabbath night, Which I witnessed with disgust, and fled from the sight.  And with regard to New York and the sights I did see, One street in Dundee is more worth to me, And, believe me, the morning I sailed from New York For Bonnie Dundee, my heart it felt as light as a cork.

I am looking for a past
I can rely on
in order to look to death
with equanimity.
What was given me:
my mother’s largeness
to protect me,
my father’s regularity
in coming home from work
at night, his opening the door
silently and smiling,
pleased to be back
and the lights on
in all the rooms
through which I could run
freely or sit at ease
at table and do my homework
undisturbed: love arranged
as order directed at the next day.
Going to bed was a journey.

Anghiari is medieval, a sleeve sloping down   
A steep hill, suddenly sweeping out
To the edge of a cliff, and dwindling.
But far up the mountain, behind the town,   
We too were swept out, out by the wind,   
Alone with the Tuscan grass. 
Wind had been blowing across the hills
For days, and everything now was graying gold   
With dust, everything we saw, even
Some small children scampering along a road,   
Twittering Italian to a small caged bird.   
We sat beside them to rest in some brushwood,   
And I leaned down to rinse the dust from my face. 
I found the spider web there, whose hinges   
Reeled heavily and crazily with the dust,
Whole mounds and cemeteries of it, sagging   
And scattering shadows among shells and wings.   
And then she stepped into the center of air   
Slender and fastidious, the golden hair
Of daylight along her shoulders, she poised there,   
While ruins crumbled on every side of her.   
Free of the dust, as though a moment before   
She had stepped inside the earth, to bathe herself. 
I gazed, close to her, till at last she stepped   
Away in her own good time. 
Many men
Have searched all over Tuscany and never found   
What I found there, the heart of the light   
Itself shelled and leaved, balancing   
On filaments themselves falling. The secret
Of this journey is to let the wind   
Blow its dust all over your body,
To let it go on blowing, to step lightly, lightly
All the way through your ruins, and not to lose
Any sleep over the dead, who surely   
Will bury their own, don’t worry.

What never comes when called.

Guest
          most at home where least
                                              expected. Vagrant
balm of Gilead.

                                                             becomes
the body’s native ground and,
                                           soon as not,
its banishment.
                        Coming and going,
                                                   indifferent,
magisterial.
                   My lovely daughter—
walking me to the car
                                 to say goodbye
the day I left
                      to keep watch at my brother’s
bedside—
               suddenly
                            singing “I
feel pretty, oh so
                            pretty”
                                        as she raised
her arms up in a loose oval
                                        over her head
and pirouetted all along the walk. 
Savage
          and magisterial—
                                     the joy of it,
the animal candor of
                                 each arabesque,
each leaping turn and counterturn,
                                                    her voice
now wobbly
                with laughter,
                                       “And I pity
any girl
             who isn’t me
                               tonight.”
Savagely beautiful,
                              not so much like
the lion that the camera
                                     freezes
                                                 in mid-
pounce, claws
                     outstretched for the stumbling
                                                                   antelope,
as like the herd
                         escaping
                                     that the camera
pans to, zig-
                     zagging,
                                  swerving as one,
their leaping strides now
                                       leaping higher,
                                                               faster,
even after,
                it seems,
                               the fear subsides—
after the fear and
                            the relief
                                             they keep
on running
                for nothing but
                                          the joy of running,
though
          it could be
                               any one of them
is running
                  from its fallen
                                           mother or father,
sister or brother,
                            across the wide
                                                      savanna,
under a bright sun
                              into fresher grass.

When beauty breaks and falls asunder   
I feel no grief for it, but wonder.
When love, like a frail shell, lies broken,   
I keep no chip of it for token.
I never had a man for friend
Who did not know that love must end.   
I never had a girl for lover
Who could discern when love was over.   
What the wise doubt, the fool believes—
Who is it, then, that love deceives?

An axe angles
                               from my neighbor’s ashcan;
It is hell’s handiwork,
                                              the wood not hickory,
The flow of the grain
                                           not faithfully followed.
The shivered shaft
                                       rises from a shellheap
Of plastic playthings,
                                             paper plates,
And the sheer shards
                                          of shattered tumblers
That were not annealed
                                             for the time needful.
At the same curbside,
                                           a cast-off cabinet
Of wavily warped
                                    unseasoned wood
Waits to be trundled
                                          in the trash-man’s truck.
Haul them off! Hide them!
                                                 The heart winces
For junk and gimcrack,
                                             for jerrybuilt things
And the men who make them
                                                 for a little money,   
Bartering pride
                                  like the bought boxer
Who pulls his punches,
                                             or the paid-off jockey   
Who in the home stretch
                                              holds in his horse.   
Yet the things themselves
                                                 in thoughtless honor
Have kept composure,
                                          like captives who would not
Talk under torture.
                                        Tossed from a tailgate
Where the dump displays
                                              its random dolmens,
Its black barrows
                                     and blazing valleys,
They shall waste in the weather
                                                          toward what they were.
The sun shall glory
                                        in the glitter of glass-chips,
Foreseeing the salvage
                                             of the prisoned sand,   
And the blistering paint
                                                peel off in patches,
That the good grain
                                        be discovered again.
Then burnt, bulldozed,
                                             they shall all be buried   
To the depth of diamonds,
                                                 in the making dark
Where halt Hephaestus
                                           keeps his hammer
And Wayland’s work
                                       is worn away.

A huge sound waits, bound in the ice,
in the icicle roots, in the buds of snow
on fir branches, in the falling silence
of snow, glittering in the sun, brilliant
as a swarm of gnats, nothing but hovering
wings at midday. With the sun comes noise.
Tongues of ice break free, fall, shatter,
splinter, speak. If I could write the words. 
Simple, like turning a page, to say Write

It may be through some foreign grace, And unfamiliar charm of face; It may be that across the foamWhich bore her from her childhood’s home, By some strange spell, my Katie brought, Along with English creeds and thought—Entangled in her golden hair—Some English sunshine, warmth, and air! I cannot tell—but here to-day, A thousand billowy leagues away From that green isle whose twilight skiesNo darker are than Katie’s eyes,She seems to me, go where she will, An English girl in England still;
I meet her on the dusty street, And daisies spring about her feet;Or, touched to life beneath her tread, An English cowslip lifts its head;And, as to do her grace, rise up The primrose and the buttercup!I roam with her through fields of cane, And seem to stroll an English lane, Which, white with blossoms of the May, Spreads its green carpet in her way! As fancy wills, the path beneath Is golden gorse, or purple heath: And now we hear in woodlands dim Their unarticulated hymn,Now walk through rippling waves of wheat, Now sink in mats of clover sweet, Or see before us from the lawn The lark go up to greet the dawn! All birds that love the English sky Throng round my path when she is by: The blackbird from a neighboring thorn With music brims the cup of morn, And in a thick, melodious rain The mavis pours her mellow strain! But only when my Katie’s voice Makes all the listening woods rejoice I hear—with cheeks that flush and pale—The passion of the nightingale!
Anon the pictures round her change, And through an ancient town we range, Whereto the shadowy memory clings Of one of England’s Saxon kings, And which to shrine his fading fame Still keeps his ashes and his name. Quaint houses rise on either hand, But still the airs are fresh and bland, As if their gentle wings caressed Some new-born village of the West. A moment by the Norman tower We pause; it is the Sabbath hour! And o’er the city sinks and swells The chime of old St. Mary’s bells, Which still resound in Katie’s earsAs sweet as when in distant years She heard them peal with jocund din A merry English Christmas in! We pass the abbey’s ruined arch, And statelier grows my Katie’s march, As round her, wearied with the taint Of Transatlantic pine and paint, She sees a thousand tokens cast Of England’s venerable Past! Our reverent footsteps lastly claims The younger chapel of St. James, Which though, as English records run, Not old, had seen full many a sun, Ere to the cold December gale The sullen Pilgrim spread his sail. There Katie in her childish daysSpelt out her prayers and lisped her praise, And doubtless, as her beauty grew, Did much as other maidens do—Across the pews and down the aisle Sent many a beau-bewildering smile, And to subserve her spirit’s need Learned other things beside the creed! There, too, to-day her knee she bows, And by her one whose darker brows Betray the Southern heart that burns Beside her, and which only turns Its thoughts to Heaven in one request, Not all unworthy to be blest, But rising from an earthlier pain Than might beseem a Christian fane. Ah! can the guileless maiden share The wish that lifts that passionate prayer? Is all at peace that breast within? Good angels! warn her of the sin! Alas! what boots it? who can save A willing victim of the wave? Who cleanse a soul that loves its guilt? Or gather wine when wine is spilt?
We quit the holy house and gain The open air; then, happy twain, Adown familiar streets we go,And now and then she turns to show, With fears that all is changing fast, Some spot that’s sacred to her Past.Here by this way, through shadows cool,A little maid, she tripped to school; And there each morning used to stop Before a wonder of a shopWhere, built of apples and of pears, Rose pyramids of golden spheres; While, dangling in her dazzled sight, Ripe cherries cast a crimson light, And made her think of elfin lamps, And feast and sport in fairy camps, Whereat, upon her royal throne (Most richly carved in cherry-stone), Titania ruled, in queenly state, The boisterous revels of the fête!’T was yonder, with their “horrid” noise, Dismissed from books, she met the boys, Who, with a barbarous scorn of girls, Glanced slightly at her sunny curls, And laughed and leaped as reckless by As though no pretty face were nigh! But—here the maiden grows demure—Indeed she’s not so very sure, That in a year, or haply twain, Few looked who failed to look again, And sooth to say, I little doubt (Some azure day, the truth will out!) That certain baits in certain eyes Caught many an unsuspecting prize; And somewhere underneath these eaves A budding flirt put forth its leaves!
Has not the sky a deeper blue, Have not the trees a greener hue,And bend they not with lordlier graceAnd nobler shapes above the place Where on one cloudless winter morn My Katie to this life was born? Ah, folly! long hath fled the hour When love to sight gave keener power, And lovers looked for special boons In brighter flowers and larger moons. But wave the foliage as it may, And let the sky be ashen gray, Thus much at least a manly youthMay hold—and yet not blush—as truth: If near that blessed spot of earth Which saw the cherished maiden’s birth No softer dews than usual rise, And life there keeps its wonted guise, Yet not the less that spot may seem As lovely as a poet’s dream;And should a fervid faith incline To make thereof a sainted shrine, Who may deny that round us throng A hundred earthly creeds as wrong, But meaner far, which yet unblamed Stalk by us and are not ashamed. So, therefore, Katie, as our stroll Ends at this portal, while you roll Those lustrous eyes to catch each ray That may recall some vanished day,I—let them jeer and laugh who will—Stoop down and kiss the sacred sill!
So strongly sometimes on the sense These fancies hold their influence,That in long well-known streets I stray Like one who fears to lose his way. The stranger, I, the native, she,Myself, not Kate, have crossed the sea; And changing place, and mixing times, I walk in unfamiliar climes!These houses, free to every breeze That blows from warm Floridian seas,Assume a massive English air,And close around an English square; While, if I issue from the town, An English hill looks greenly down, Or round me rolls an English park, And in the Broad I hear the Larke! Thus when, where woodland violets hide, I rove with Katie at my side,It scarce would seem amiss to say, “Katie! my home lies far away, Beyond the pathless waste of brine, In a young land of palm and pine! There, by the tropic heats, the soul Is touched as if with living coal, And glows with such a fire as none Can feel beneath a Northern sun, Unless—my Katie’s heart attest!—’T is kindled in an English breast! Such is the land in which I live, And, Katie! such the soul I give. Come! ere another morning beam, We’ll cleave the sea with wings of steam; And soon, despite of storm or calm, Beneath my native groves of palm,Kind friends shall greet, with joy and pride, The Southron and his English bride!”

I drove through the narrow Gods—
privet and cholesterol, or   
Irish creamery butter as the waiter 
called it, as it shaved another day   
off my life. There was no salt   
and antimony, just lumpy roads 
through Meath and Leitrim.   
The sky was a show of flashing   
mirrors as day broke on Rosses. 
Tide out and weed like cow pies   
on the shore. The punt down and   
the EEC on the horizon, 
as I read in the guidebook about pilgrims   
climbing St. Patrick’s barefoot   
every summer. 
Out of the fog a man in Wranglers and   
spurred boots, clean-shaven, a cigarette   
in hand, waved me down.  “Scrum faced house at the end of the bay.”

FOR BAILEY



We were entwined in red rings   
Of blood and loneliness before   
The first snows fell
Before muddy rivers seeded clouds   
Above a virgin forest, and   
Men ran naked, blue and black   
Skinned into the warm embraces   
Of Sheba, Eve and Lilith.
I was your sister. 
You left me to force strangers   
Into brother molds, exacting   
Taxations they never
Owed or could ever pay. 
You fought to die, thinking   
In destruction lies the seed   
Of birth. You may be right. 
I will remember silent walks in   
Southern woods and long talks   
In low voices
Shielding meaning from the big ears   
Of overcurious adults. 
You may be right.   
Your slow return from
Regions of terror and bloody
Screams, races my heart.
I hear again the laughter   
Of children and see fireflies   
Bursting tiny explosions in   
An Arkansas twilight.

Kind are her answers,
 But her performance keeps no day;
 Breaks time, as dancers
 From their own music when they stray:
 All her free favorsAnd smooth words wing my hopes in vain.O did ever voice so sweet but only feign?
 Can true love yield such delay,
 Converting joy to pain?
  Lost is our freedom,
 When we submit to women so:
 Why do we need ’em,
 When in their best they work our woe?
 There is no wisdomCan alter ends, by Fate prefixed.O why is the good of man with evil mixed?
 Never were days yet called two,
 But one night went betwixt.

I will have been walking away:
no matter what direction I intended,
at that moment, I will have been walking 
Away into the direction that you now say
I have always intended, no matter what my
intention was then, I will have been 
Walking away, though it will not be clear
what it was that I was leaving or
even why, it seems that you will say 
That always, I was walking away,
intending a direction that was not towards
you, but moving away with every step, 
Or, even when I pretended to be walking
towards you, only making the place
for my feet to go backwards, 
Away, where I will have been walking,
always away:   intention and direction
unknown, but knowing you will always
say I will have been walking away.

The kindergarten concert was an interesting show.
Peter walked onto the stage and yelled, “I have to go!”
Katie was embarrassed, but she had nowhere to hide.
She raised her dress to hide her face. Her mother almost died.
Keith removed his tie and said, “It’s ugly, Dad. I hate it!”
David picked his nose on stage. What’s worse is that he ate it.
They sang their song, and Wyatt burped. Then he did a dance.
Michael fell while spinning ’round. Peter wet his pants.
The music teacher at the end said, “There, I’m glad that’s done.”
The kindergarten bowed and said, “Let’s sing another one!”

I’m an ol’ king bee, honey,
Buzzin’ from flower to flower.
I’m an ol’ king bee, sweets,
Hummin’ from flower to flower.
Women got good pollen;
I get some every hour. 
There’s Lily in the valley
And sweet honeysuckle Rose too;
There’s Lily in the valley
And sweet honeysuckle Rose too.
And there’s pretty black-eyed Susan,
Perfect as the night is blue. 
You don’t have to trust
A single, black word I say.
You don’t have to trust
A single, black word I say.
But don’t be surprised
If I sting your flower today.

In a year the nightingales were said to be so loud
they drowned out slumber, and peafowl strolled screaming   
beside the ruined nunnery, through the long evening   
of a dazzled pub crawl, the halcyon color, portholed   
by those eye-spots’ stunning tapestry, unsettled
the pastoral nightfall with amazements opening. 
Months later, intermission in a pub on Fifty-fifth Street   
found one of them still breathless, the other quizzical,   
acting the philistine, puncturing Stravinsky—“Tell   
me, what was that racket in the orchestra about?”—
hauling down the Firebird, harum-scarum, like a kite,   
a burnished, breathing wreck that didn’t hurt at all. 
Among the Bronx Zoo’s exiled jungle fowl, they heard   
through headphones of a separating panic, the bellbird   
reiterate its single chong, a scream nobody answered.   
When he mourned, “The poetry is gone,” she quailed,   
seeing how his hands shook, sobered into feeling old.   
By midnight, yet another fifth would have been killed. 
A Sunday morning, the November of their cataclysm   
(Dylan Thomas brought in in extremis to St. Vincent’s,   
that same week, a symptomatic datum) found them   
wandering a downtown churchyard. Among its headstones,   
while from unruined choirs the noise of Christendom   
poured over Wall Street, a benison in vestments, 
a late thrush paused, in transit from some grizzled   
spruce bog to the humid equatorial fireside: berry-
eyed, bark-brown above, with dark hints of trauma   
in the stigmata of its underparts—or so, too bruised   
just then to have invented anything so fancy,
later, re-embroidering a retrospect, she had supposed. 
In gray England, years of muted recrimination (then   
dead silence) later, she could not have said how many   
spoiled takeoffs, how many entanglements gone sodden,   
how many gaudy evenings made frantic by just one   
insomniac nightingale, how many liaisons gone down   
screaming in a stroll beside the ruined nunnery; 
a kingfisher’s burnished plunge, the color   
of felicity afire, came glancing like an arrow   
through landscapes of untended memory: ardor   
illuminating with its terrifying currency
now no mere glimpse, no porthole vista
but, down on down, the uninhabitable sorrow.

Kiss’d yestreen, and kiss’d yestreen,Up the Gallowgate, down the Green:I’ve woo’d wi’ lords, and woo’d wi’ lairds,I’ve mool’d wi carles and mell’d wi’ cairds,I’ve kiss’d wi’ priests— ‘twas done i’ the dark,Twice in my gown and thrice in my sark;But priest, nor lord, nor loon can gieSic kindly kisses as he gae me.

My breasts are small and my eyes round.   
Your legs long and cool as the freshet
that runs down from the fountain.
I bite your neck,
it’s sturdy, still not yet ripe,
like a walnut that has just now fallen.
You clamber on top, start kissing my middle,   
strew wet wavelets all over my skin,
now up here, now down there,
like the first fat drops to fall before
the storm starts, splat, splat, splat. 
We’ve gone to sleep back to chest,   
the way lips rejoin   
after sighing.


^^EOP^^

Though I with strange desireTo kiss those rosy lips am set on fire,Yet will I cease to craveSweet touches in such store,As he who long beforeFrom Lesbia them in thousands did receive.Heart mine, but once me kiss,And I by that sweet blissEven swear to cease you to importune more;Poor one no number is;Another word of me ye shall not hearAfter one kiss, but still one kiss, my dear.

A few light flakes of snow
Fall in the feeble sun;
Birds sing in the cold,
A warbler by the wall. The plum
Buds tight and chill soon bloom.
The moon begins first
Fourth, a faint slice west
At nightfall. Jupiter half-way
High at the end of night-
Meditation. The dove cry
Twangs like a bow.
At dawn Mt. Hiei dusted white
On top; in the clear air
Folds of all the gullied green
Hills around the town are sharp,
Breath stings. Beneath the roofs
Of frosty houses
Lovers part, from tangle warm
Of gentle bodies under quilt
And crack the icy water to the face
And wake and feed the children
And grandchildren that they love.

Is it because your sable hairIs folded over brows that wear At times a too imperial air;
Or is it that the thoughts which riseIn those dark orbs do seek disguise Beneath the lids of Eastern eyes;
That choose whatever pose or place May chance to please, in you I trace The noblest women of your race?
The crowd is sauntering at its ease, And humming like a hive of bees—You take your seat and touch the keys.
I do not hear the giddy throng; The sea avenges Israel’s wrong,And on the wind floats Miriam’s song!
You join me with a stately grace; Music to Poesy gives place;Some grand emotion lights your face.
At once I stand by Mizpeh’s walls; With smiles the martyred daughter falls, And desolate are Mizpeh’s halls!
Intrusive babblers come between;With calm, pale brow and lofty mien, You thread the circle like a queen!
Then sweeps the royal Esther by; The deep devotion in her eye Is looking “If I die, I die!”
You stroll the garden’s flowery walks; The plants to me are grainless stalks, And Ruth to old Naomi talks.
Adopted child of Judah’s creed,Like Judah’s daughters, true at need, I see you mid the alien seed.
I watch afar the gleaner sweet; I wake like Boaz in the wheat, And find you lying at my feet!
My feet! Oh! if the spell that luresMy heart through all these dreams endures, How soon shall I be stretched at yours!

Agathas  Four and forty lovers had Agathas in the old days,All of whom she refused;
And now she turns to me seeking love,And her hair also is turning.
Young Lady  I have fed your lar with poppies,I have adored you for three full years;And now you grumble because your dress does not fitAnd because I happen to say so.
Lesbia Illa  Memnon, Memnon, that ladyWho used to walk about amongst usWith such gracious uncertainty,Is now weddedTo a British householder.Lugete, Veneres! Lugete, Cupidinesque!  Passing  Flawless as Aphrodite,Thoroughly beautiful,Brainless,The faint odor of your patchouli,Faint, almost, as the lines of cruelty about your chin,Assails me, and concerns me almost as little.

I have done it again.   
One year in every ten   
I manage it—— 
A sort of walking miracle, my skin   
Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   
My right foot 
A paperweight,
My face a featureless, fine   
Jew linen. 
Peel off the napkin   
O my enemy.   
Do I terrify?—— 
The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   
The sour breath
Will vanish in a day. 
Soon, soon the flesh
The grave cave ate will be   
At home on me 
And I a smiling woman.   
I am only thirty.
And like the cat I have nine times to die. 
This is Number Three.   
What a trash
To annihilate each decade. 
What a million filaments.   
The peanut-crunching crowd   
Shoves in to see 
Them unwrap me hand and foot——
The big strip tease.   
Gentlemen, ladies 
These are my hands   
My knees.
I may be skin and bone, 
Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   
The first time it happened I was ten.   
It was an accident. 
The second time I meant
To last it out and not come back at all.   
I rocked shut 
As a seashell.
They had to call and call
And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls. 
Dying
Is an art, like everything else.   
I do it exceptionally well. 
I do it so it feels like hell.   
I do it so it feels real.
I guess you could say I’ve a call. 
It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.
It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.   
It’s the theatrical 
Comeback in broad day
To the same place, the same face, the same brute   
Amused shout: 
‘A miracle!’
That knocks me out.   
There is a charge 
For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   
For the hearing of my heart——
It really goes. 
And there is a charge, a very large charge   
For a word or a touch   
Or a bit of blood 
Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   
So, so, Herr Doktor.   
So, Herr Enemy. 
I am your opus,
I am your valuable,   
The pure gold baby 
That melts to a shriek.   
I turn and burn.
Do not think I underestimate your great concern. 
Ash, ash—
You poke and stir.
Flesh, bone, there is nothing there—— 
A cake of soap,   
A wedding ring,   
A gold filling. 
Herr God, Herr Lucifer   
Beware
Beware. 
Out of the ash
I rise with my red hair   
And I eat men like air.

Five hours, (and who can do it less in?) By haughty Celia spent in dressing; The goddess from her chamber issues, Arrayed in lace, brocades and tissues.          Strephon, who found the room was void, And Betty otherwise employed, Stole in, and took a strict survey, Of all the litter as it lay; Whereof, to make the matter clear, An inventory follows here.          And first a dirty smock appeared, Beneath the armpits well besmeared. Strephon, the rogue, displayed it wide, And turned it round on every side. On such a point few words are best, And Strephon bids us guess the rest, But swears how damnably the men lie, In calling Celia sweet and cleanly. Now listen while he next produces The various combs for various uses, Filled up with dirt so closely fixt, No brush could force a way betwixt. A paste of composition rare, Sweat, dandruff, powder, lead and hair; A forehead cloth with oil upon’t To smooth the wrinkles on her front; Here alum flower to stop the steams, Exhaled from sour unsavory streams, There night-gloves made of Tripsy’s hide, Bequeathed by Tripsy when she died, With puppy water, beauty’s help Distilled from Tripsy’s darling whelp; Here gallypots and vials placed, Some filled with washes, some with paste, Some with pomatum, paints and slops, And ointments good for scabby chops. Hard by a filthy basin stands, Fouled with the scouring of her hands; The basin takes whatever comes The scrapings of her teeth and gums, A nasty compound of all hues, For here she spits, and here she spews. But oh! it turned poor Strephon’s bowels, When he beheld and smelled the towels, Begummed, bemattered, and beslimed With dirt, and sweat, and earwax grimed. No object Strephon’s eye escapes, Here petticoats in frowzy heaps; Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot All varnished o’er with snuff and snot. The stockings why should I expose, Stained with the marks of stinking toes; Or greasy coifs and pinners reeking, Which Celia slept at least a week in? A pair of tweezers next he found To pluck her brows in arches round, Or hairs that sink the forehead low, Or on her chin like bristles grow.          The virtues we must not let pass, Of Celia’s magnifying glass. When frightened Strephon cast his eye on’t It showed visage of a giant. A glass that can to sight disclose, The smallest worm in Celia’s nose, And faithfully direct her nail To squeeze it out from head to tail; For catch it nicely by the head, It must come out alive or dead.          Why Strephon will you tell the rest? And must you needs describe the chest? That careless wench! no creature warn her To move it out from yonder corner; But leave it standing full in sight For you to exercise your spite. In vain the workman showed his wit With rings and hinges counterfeit To make it seem in this disguise A cabinet to vulgar eyes; For Strephon ventured to look in, Resolved to go through thick and thin; He lifts the lid, there needs no more, He smelled it all the time before. As from within Pandora’s box, When Epimetheus op’d the locks, A sudden universal crew Of human evils upwards flew; He still was comforted to find That Hope at last remained behind; So Strephon lifting up the lid, To view what in the chest was hid. The vapors flew from out the vent, But Strephon cautious never meant The bottom of the pan to grope, And foul his hands in search of Hope. O never may such vile machine Be once in Celia’s chamber seen! O may she better learn to keep Those “secrets of the hoary deep!”          As mutton cutlets, prime of meat, Which though with art you salt and beat As laws of cookery require, And toast them at the clearest fire; If from adown the hopeful chops The fat upon a cinder drops, To stinking smoke it turns the flame Pois’ning the flesh from whence it came, And up exhales a greasy stench, For which you curse the careless wench; So things, which must not be expressed, When plumped into the reeking chest, Send up an excremental smell To taint the parts from whence they fell. The petticoats and gown perfume, Which waft a stink round every room. Thus finishing his grand survey, Disgusted Strephon stole away Repeating in his amorous fits, Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits!          But Vengeance, goddess never sleeping Soon punished Strephon for his peeping; His foul imagination links Each Dame he sees with all her stinks: And, if unsavory odors fly, Conceives a lady standing by: All women his description fits, And both ideas jump like wits: But vicious fancy coupled fast, And still appearing in contrast. I pity wretched Strephon blind To all the charms of female kind; Should I the queen of love refuse, Because she rose from stinking ooze? To him that looks behind the scene, Satira’s but some pocky queen. When Celia in her glory shows, If Strephon would but stop his nose (Who now so impiously blasphemes Her ointments, daubs, and paints and creams, Her washes, slops, and every clout, With which he makes so foul a rout) He soon would learn to think like me, And bless his ravished sight to see Such order from confusion sprung, Such gaudy tulips raised from dung.

From The Fire-worshippers



“How sweetly,” said the trembling maid, Of her own gentle voice afraid, So long had they in silence stood, Looking upon that tranquil flood— “How sweetly does the moon-beam smile To-night upon yon leafy isle! Oft in my fancy’s wanderings, I’ve wish’d that little isle had wings, And we, within its fairy bow’rs,       Were wafted off to seas unknown, Where not a pulse should beat but ours,       And we might live, love, die alone! Far from the cruel and the cold,—       Where the bright eyes of angels only Should come around us, to behold       A paradise so pure and lonely. Would this be world enough for thee?”— Playful she turn’d, that he might see       The passing smile her cheek put on; But when she mark’d how mournfully       His eyes met hers, that smile was gone; And, bursting into heart-felt tears, “Yes, yes,” she cried, “my hourly fears My dreams have boded all too right— We part—for ever part—to-night! I knew, I knew it  could not last— ’Twas bright, ’twas heav’nly, but ’tis past! Oh! ever thus, from childhood’s hour, I’ve seen my fondest hopes decay; I never lov’d a tree or flow’r,       But ’twas the first to fade away. I never nurs’d a dear gazelle       To glad me with its soft black eye, But when it came to know me well       And love me, it was sure to die! Now too—the joy most like divine       Of all I ever dreamt or knew, To see thee, hear thee, call thee mine,—       Oh misery! must I lose  that too? Yet go—on peril’s brink we meet;—       Those frightful rocks—that treach’rous sea— No, never come again—though sweet,       Though heav’n, it may be death to thee. Farewell—and blessings on thy way,       Where’er thou goest, beloved stranger! Better to sit and watch that ray, And think thee safe, though far away,       Than have thee near me, and in danger!”

Your dying was a difficult enterprise.
First, petty things took up your energies,
The small but clustering duties of the sick,   
Irritant as the cough’s dry rhetoric.
Those hours of waiting for pills, shot, X-ray   
Or test (while you read novels two a day)   
Already with a kind of clumsy stealth
Distanced you from the habits of your health.
    In hope still, courteous still, but tired and thin,   
You tried to stay the man that you had been,   
Treating each symptom as a mere mishap   
Without import. But then the spinal tap.
It brought a hard headache, and when night came   
I heard you wake up from the same bad dream   
Every half-hour with the same short cry
Of mild outrage, before immediately
Slipping into the nightmare once again
Empty of content but the drip of pain.
No respite followed: though the nightmare ceased,   
Your cough grew thick and rich, its strength increased.   
Four nights, and on the fifth we drove you down   
To the Emergency Room. That frown, that frown:   
I’d never seen such rage in you before
As when they wheeled you through the swinging door.   
For you knew, rightly, they conveyed you from   
Those normal pleasures of the sun’s kingdom   
The hedonistic body basks within
And takes for granted—summer on the skin,   
Sleep without break, the moderate taste of tea   
In a dry mouth. You had gone on from me
As if your body sought out martyrdom   
In the far Canada of a hospital room.   
Once there, you entered fully the distress   
And long pale rigours of the wilderness.   
A gust of morphine hid you. Back in sight
You breathed through a segmented tube, fat, white,   
Jammed down your throat so that you could not speak.
    How thin the distance made you. In your cheek   
One day, appeared the true shape of your bone   
No longer padded. Still your mind, alone,   
Explored this emptying intermediate   
State for what holds and rests were hidden in it.
    You wrote us messages on a pad, amused   
At one time that you had your nurse confused   
Who, seeing you reconciled after four years   
With your grey father, both of you in tears,   
Asked if this was at last your ‘special friend’
(The one you waited for until the end).   
‘She sings,’ you wrote, ‘a Philippine folk song   
To wake me in the morning ... It is long   
And very pretty.’ Grabbing at detail   
To furnish this bare ledge toured by the gale,   
On which you lay, bed restful as a knife,   
You tried, tried hard, to make of it a life   
Thick with the complicating circumstance
Your thoughts might fasten on. It had been chance   
Always till now that had filled up the moment   
With live specifics your hilarious comment   
Discovered as it went along; and fed,   
Laconic, quick, wherever it was led.   
You improvised upon your own delight.   
I think back to the scented summer night   
We talked between our sleeping bags, below
A molten field of stars five years ago:
I was so tickled by your mind’s light touch
I couldn’t sleep, you made me laugh too much,   
Though I was tired and begged you to leave off. 
Now you were tired, and yet not tired enough
—Still hungry for the great world you were losing   
Steadily in no season of your choosing—
And when at last the whole death was assured,   
Drugs having failed, and when you had endured   
Two weeks of an abominable constraint,   
You faced it equably, without complaint,   
Unwhimpering, but not at peace with it.   
You’d lived as if your time was infinite:   
You were not ready and not reconciled,   
Feeling as uncompleted as a child
Till you had shown the world what you could do   
In some ambitious role to be worked through,   
A role your need for it had half-defined,   
But never wholly, even in your mind.   
You lacked the necessary ruthlessness,   
The soaring meanness that pinpoints success.   
We loved that lack of self-love, and your smile,   
Rueful, at your own silliness.
                                              Meanwhile,
Your lungs collapsed, and the machine, unstrained,   
Did all your breathing now. Nothing remained   
But death by drowning on an inland sea   
Of your own fluids, which it seemed could be   
Kindly forestalled by drugs. Both could and would:   
Nothing was said, everything understood,   
At least by us. Your own concerns were not   
Long-term, precisely, when they gave the shot
—You made local arrangements to the bed   
And pulled a pillow round beside your head.
    And so you slept, and died, your skin gone grey,   
Achieving your completeness, in a way. 
Outdoors next day, I was dizzy from a sense   
Of being ejected with some violence
From vigil in a white and distant spot   
Where I was numb, into this garden plot
Too warm, too close, and not enough like pain.   
I was delivered into time again
—The variations that I live among
Where your long body too used to belong   
And where the still bush is minutely active.   
You never thought your body was attractive,   
Though others did, and yet you trusted it   
And must have loved its fickleness a bit
Since it was yours and gave you what it could,   
Till near the end it let you down for good,   
Its blood hospitable to those guests who   
Took over by betraying it into
The greatest of its inconsistencies
This difficult, tedious, painful enterprise.

For Christopher Merrill



Swear by the olive in the God-kissed land—
There is no sugar in the promised land. 
Why must the bars turn neon now when, Love,   
I’m already drunk in your capitalist land? 
If home is found on both sides of the globe,
home is of course here—and always a missed land. 
The hour’s come to redeem the pledge (not wholly?)   
in Fate’s "Long years ago we made a tryst" land. 
Clearly, these men were here only to destroy,   
a mosque now the dust of a prejudiced land. 
Will the Doomsayers die, bitten with envy,   
when springtime returns to our dismissed land? 
The prisons fill with the cries of children.
Then how do you subsist, how do you persist, Land? 
“Is my love nothing for I’ve borne no children?”
I’m with you, Sappho, in that anarchist land. 
A hurricane is born when the wings flutter ...   
Where will the butterfly, on my wrist, land? 
You made me wait for one who wasn’t even there   
though summer had finished in that tourist land. 
Do the blind hold temples close to their eyes   
when we steal their gods for our atheist land? 
Abandoned bride, Night throws down her jewels   
so Rome—on our descent—is an amethyst land. 
At the moment the heart turns terrorist,
are Shahid’s arms broken, O Promised Land?

A huge sound waits, bound in the ice,
in the icicle roots, in the buds of snow
on fir branches, in the falling silence
of snow, glittering in the sun, brilliant
as a swarm of gnats, nothing but hovering
wings at midday. With the sun comes noise.
Tongues of ice break free, fall, shatter,
splinter, speak. If I could write the words. 
Simple, like turning a page, to say Write
what happened

It may be through some foreign grace, And unfamiliar charm of face; It may be that across the foamWhich bore her from her childhood’s home, By some strange spell, my Katie brought, Along with English creeds and thought—Entangled in her golden hair—Some English sunshine, warmth, and air! I cannot tell—but here to-day, A thousand billowy leagues away From that green isle whose twilight skiesNo darker are than Katie’s eyes,She seems to me, go where she will, An English girl in England still;
I meet her on the dusty street, And daisies spring about her feet;Or, touched to life beneath her tread, An English cowslip lifts its head;And, as to do her grace, rise up The primrose and the buttercup!I roam with her through fields of cane, And seem to stroll an English lane, Which, white with blossoms of the May, Spreads its green carpet in her way! As fancy wills, the path beneath Is golden gorse, or purple heath: And now we hear in woodlands dim Their unarticulated hymn,Now walk through rippling waves of wheat, Now sink in mats of clover sweet, Or see before us from the lawn The lark go up to greet the dawn! All birds that love the English sky Throng round my path when she is by: The blackbird from a neighboring thorn With music brims the cup of morn, And in a thick, melodious rain The mavis pours her mellow strain! But only when my Katie’s voice Makes all the listening woods rejoice I hear—with cheeks that flush and pale—The passion of the nightingale!
Anon the pictures round her change, And through an ancient town we range, Whereto the shadowy memory clings Of one of England’s Saxon kings, And which to shrine his fading fame Still keeps his ashes and his name. Quaint houses rise on either hand, But still the airs are fresh and bland, As if their gentle wings caressed Some new-born village of the West. A moment by the Norman tower We pause; it is the Sabbath hour! And o’er the city sinks and swells The chime of old St. Mary’s bells, Which still resound in Katie’s earsAs sweet as when in distant years She heard them peal with jocund din A merry English Christmas in! We pass the abbey’s ruined arch, And statelier grows my Katie’s march, As round her, wearied with the taint Of Transatlantic pine and paint, She sees a thousand tokens cast Of England’s venerable Past! Our reverent footsteps lastly claims The younger chapel of St. James, Which though, as English records run, Not old, had seen full many a sun, Ere to the cold December gale The sullen Pilgrim spread his sail. There Katie in her childish daysSpelt out her prayers and lisped her praise, And doubtless, as her beauty grew, Did much as other maidens do—Across the pews and down the aisle Sent many a beau-bewildering smile, And to subserve her spirit’s need Learned other things beside the creed! There, too, to-day her knee she bows, And by her one whose darker brows Betray the Southern heart that burns Beside her, and which only turns Its thoughts to Heaven in one request, Not all unworthy to be blest, But rising from an earthlier pain Than might beseem a Christian fane. Ah! can the guileless maiden share The wish that lifts that passionate prayer? Is all at peace that breast within? Good angels! warn her of the sin! Alas! what boots it? who can save A willing victim of the wave? Who cleanse a soul that loves its guilt? Or gather wine when wine is spilt?
We quit the holy house and gain The open air; then, happy twain, Adown familiar streets we go,And now and then she turns to show, With fears that all is changing fast, Some spot that’s sacred to her Past.Here by this way, through shadows cool,A little maid, she tripped to school; And there each morning used to stop Before a wonder of a shopWhere, built of apples and of pears, Rose pyramids of golden spheres; While, dangling in her dazzled sight, Ripe cherries cast a crimson light, And made her think of elfin lamps, And feast and sport in fairy camps, Whereat, upon her royal throne (Most richly carved in cherry-stone), Titania ruled, in queenly state, The boisterous revels of the fête!’T was yonder, with their “horrid” noise, Dismissed from books, she met the boys, Who, with a barbarous scorn of girls, Glanced slightly at her sunny curls, And laughed and leaped as reckless by As though no pretty face were nigh! But—here the maiden grows demure—Indeed she’s not so very sure, That in a year, or haply twain, Few looked who failed to look again, And sooth to say, I little doubt (Some azure day, the truth will out!) That certain baits in certain eyes Caught many an unsuspecting prize; And somewhere underneath these eaves A budding flirt put forth its leaves!
Has not the sky a deeper blue, Have not the trees a greener hue,And bend they not with lordlier graceAnd nobler shapes above the place Where on one cloudless winter morn My Katie to this life was born? Ah, folly! long hath fled the hour When love to sight gave keener power, And lovers looked for special boons In brighter flowers and larger moons. But wave the foliage as it may, And let the sky be ashen gray, Thus much at least a manly youthMay hold—and yet not blush—as truth: If near that blessed spot of earth Which saw the cherished maiden’s birth No softer dews than usual rise, And life there keeps its wonted guise, Yet not the less that spot may seem As lovely as a poet’s dream;And should a fervid faith incline To make thereof a sainted shrine, Who may deny that round us throng A hundred earthly creeds as wrong, But meaner far, which yet unblamed Stalk by us and are not ashamed. So, therefore, Katie, as our stroll Ends at this portal, while you roll Those lustrous eyes to catch each ray That may recall some vanished day,I—let them jeer and laugh who will—Stoop down and kiss the sacred sill!
So strongly sometimes on the sense These fancies hold their influence,That in long well-known streets I stray Like one who fears to lose his way. The stranger, I, the native, she,Myself, not Kate, have crossed the sea; And changing place, and mixing times, I walk in unfamiliar climes!These houses, free to every breeze That blows from warm Floridian seas,Assume a massive English air,And close around an English square; While, if I issue from the town, An English hill looks greenly down, Or round me rolls an English park, And in the Broad I hear the Larke! Thus when, where woodland violets hide, I rove with Katie at my side,It scarce would seem amiss to say, “Katie! my home lies far away, Beyond the pathless waste of brine, In a young land of palm and pine! There, by the tropic heats, the soul Is touched as if with living coal, And glows with such a fire as none Can feel beneath a Northern sun, Unless—my Katie’s heart attest!—’T is kindled in an English breast! Such is the land in which I live, And, Katie! such the soul I give. Come! ere another morning beam, We’ll cleave the sea with wings of steam; And soon, despite of storm or calm, Beneath my native groves of palm,Kind friends shall greet, with joy and pride, The Southron and his English bride!”

I drove through the narrow Gods—
privet and cholesterol, or   
Irish creamery butter as the waiter 
called it, as it shaved another day   
off my life. There was no salt   
and antimony, just lumpy roads 
through Meath and Leitrim.   
The sky was a show of flashing   
mirrors as day broke on Rosses. 
Tide out and weed like cow pies   
on the shore. The punt down and   
the EEC on the horizon, 
as I read in the guidebook about pilgrims   
climbing St. Patrick’s barefoot   
every summer. 
Out of the fog a man in Wranglers and   
spurred boots, clean-shaven, a cigarette   
in hand, waved me down.  “Scrum faced house at the end of the bay.”   
“Hop in,” I said. “You lookin’

FOR BAILEY



We were entwined in red rings   
Of blood and loneliness before   
The first snows fell
Before muddy rivers seeded clouds   
Above a virgin forest, and   
Men ran naked, blue and black   
Skinned into the warm embraces   
Of Sheba, Eve and Lilith.
I was your sister. 
You left me to force strangers   
Into brother molds, exacting   
Taxations they never
Owed or could ever pay. 
You fought to die, thinking   
In destruction lies the seed   
Of birth. You may be right. 
I will remember silent walks in   
Southern woods and long talks   
In low voices
Shielding meaning from the big ears   
Of overcurious adults. 
You may be right.   
Your slow return from
Regions of terror and bloody
Screams, races my heart.
I hear again the laughter   
Of children and see fireflies   
Bursting tiny explosions in   
An Arkansas twilight.

Kind are her answers,
 But her performance keeps no day;
 Breaks time, as dancers
 From their own music when they stray:
 All her free favorsAnd smooth words wing my hopes in vain.O did ever voice so sweet but only feign?
 Can true love yield such delay,
 Converting joy to pain?
  Lost is our freedom,
 When we submit to women so:
 Why do we need ’em,
 When in their best they work our woe?
 There is no wisdomCan alter ends, by Fate prefixed.O why is the good of man with evil mixed?
 Never were days yet called two,
 But one night went betwixt.

I will have been walking away:
no matter what direction I intended,
at that moment, I will have been walking 
Away into the direction that you now say
I have always intended, no matter what my
intention was then, I will have been 
Walking away, though it will not be clear
what it was that I was leaving or
even why, it seems that you will say 
That always, I was walking away,
intending a direction that was not towards
you, but moving away with every step, 
Or, even when I pretended to be walking
towards you, only making the place
for my feet to go backwards, 
Away, where I will have been walking,
always away:   intention and direction
unknown, but knowing you will always
say I will have been walking away.

The kindergarten concert was an interesting show.
Peter walked onto the stage and yelled, “I have to go!”
Katie was embarrassed, but she had nowhere to hide.
She raised her dress to hide her face. Her mother almost died.
Keith removed his tie and said, “It’s ugly, Dad. I hate it!”
David picked his nose on stage. What’s worse is that he ate it.
They sang their song, and Wyatt burped. Then he did a dance.
Michael fell while spinning ’round. Peter wet his pants.
The music teacher at the end said, “There, I’m glad that’s done.”
The kindergarten bowed and said, “Let’s sing another one!”

In a year the nightingales were said to be so loud
they drowned out slumber, and peafowl strolled screaming   
beside the ruined nunnery, through the long evening   
of a dazzled pub crawl, the halcyon color, portholed   
by those eye-spots’ stunning tapestry, unsettled
the pastoral nightfall with amazements opening. 
Months later, intermission in a pub on Fifty-fifth Street   
found one of them still breathless, the other quizzical,   
acting the philistine, puncturing Stravinsky—“Tell   
me, what was that racket in the orchestra about?”—
hauling down the Firebird, harum-scarum, like a kite,   
a burnished, breathing wreck that didn’t hurt at all. 
Among the Bronx Zoo’s exiled jungle fowl, they heard   
through headphones of a separating panic, the bellbird   
reiterate its single chong, a scream nobody answered.   
When he mourned, “The poetry is gone,” she quailed,   
seeing how his hands shook, sobered into feeling old.   
By midnight, yet another fifth would have been killed. 
A Sunday morning, the November of their cataclysm   
(Dylan Thomas brought in in extremis to St. Vincent’s,   
that same week, a symptomatic datum) found them   
wandering a downtown churchyard. Among its headstones,   
while from unruined choirs the noise of Christendom   
poured over Wall Street, a benison in vestments, 
a late thrush paused, in transit from some grizzled   
spruce bog to the humid equatorial fireside: berry-
eyed, bark-brown above, with dark hints of trauma   
in the stigmata of its underparts—or so, too bruised   
just then to have invented anything so fancy,
later, re-embroidering a retrospect, she had supposed. 
In gray England, years of muted recrimination (then   
dead silence) later, she could not have said how many   
spoiled takeoffs, how many entanglements gone sodden,   
how many gaudy evenings made frantic by just one   
insomniac nightingale, how many liaisons gone down   
screaming in a stroll beside the ruined nunnery; 
a kingfisher’s burnished plunge, the color   
of felicity afire, came glancing like an arrow   
through landscapes of untended memory: ardor   
illuminating with its terrifying currency
now no mere glimpse, no porthole vista
but, down on down, the uninhabitable sorrow.

Kiss’d yestreen, and kiss’d yestreen,Up the Gallowgate, down the Green:I’ve woo’d wi’ lords, and woo’d wi’ lairds,I’ve mool’d wi carles and mell’d wi’ cairds,I’ve kiss’d wi’ priests— ‘twas done i’ the dark,Twice in my gown and thrice in my sark;But priest, nor lord, nor loon can gieSic kindly kisses as he gae me.

My breasts are small and my eyes round.   
Your legs long and cool as the freshet
that runs down from the fountain.
I bite your neck,
it’s sturdy, still not yet ripe,
like a walnut that has just now fallen.
You clamber on top, start kissing my middle,   
strew wet wavelets all over my skin,
now up here, now down there,
like the first fat drops to fall before
the storm starts, splat, splat, splat. 
We’ve gone to sleep back to chest,   
the way lips rejoin   
after sighing.


^^EOP^^

Though I with strange desireTo kiss those rosy lips am set on fire,Yet will I cease to craveSweet touches in such store,As he who long beforeFrom Lesbia them in thousands did receive.Heart mine, but once me kiss,And I by that sweet blissEven swear to cease you to importune more;Poor one no number is;Another word of me ye shall not hearAfter one kiss, but still one kiss, my dear.

A few light flakes of snow
Fall in the feeble sun;
Birds sing in the cold,
A warbler by the wall. The plum
Buds tight and chill soon bloom.
The moon begins first
Fourth, a faint slice west
At nightfall. Jupiter half-way
High at the end of night-
Meditation. The dove cry
Twangs like a bow.
At dawn Mt. Hiei dusted white
On top; in the clear air
Folds of all the gullied green
Hills around the town are sharp,
Breath stings. Beneath the roofs
Of frosty houses
Lovers part, from tangle warm
Of gentle bodies under quilt
And crack the icy water to the face
And wake and feed the children
And grandchildren that they love.

Is it because your sable hairIs folded over brows that wear At times a too imperial air;
Or is it that the thoughts which riseIn those dark orbs do seek disguise Beneath the lids of Eastern eyes;
That choose whatever pose or place May chance to please, in you I trace The noblest women of your race?
The crowd is sauntering at its ease, And humming like a hive of bees—You take your seat and touch the keys.
I do not hear the giddy throng; The sea avenges Israel’s wrong,And on the wind floats Miriam’s song!
You join me with a stately grace; Music to Poesy gives place;Some grand emotion lights your face.
At once I stand by Mizpeh’s walls; With smiles the martyred daughter falls, And desolate are Mizpeh’s halls!
Intrusive babblers come between;With calm, pale brow and lofty mien, You thread the circle like a queen!
Then sweeps the royal Esther by; The deep devotion in her eye Is looking “If I die, I die!”
You stroll the garden’s flowery walks; The plants to me are grainless stalks, And Ruth to old Naomi talks.
Adopted child of Judah’s creed,Like Judah’s daughters, true at need, I see you mid the alien seed.
I watch afar the gleaner sweet; I wake like Boaz in the wheat, And find you lying at my feet!
My feet! Oh! if the spell that luresMy heart through all these dreams endures, How soon shall I be stretched at yours!

Agathas  Four and forty lovers had Agathas in the old days,All of whom she refused;
And now she turns to me seeking love,And her hair also is turning.
Young Lady  I have fed your lar with poppies,I have adored you for three full years;And now you grumble because your dress does not fitAnd because I happen to say so.
Lesbia Illa  Memnon, Memnon, that ladyWho used to walk about amongst usWith such gracious uncertainty,Is now weddedTo a British householder.Lugete, Veneres! Lugete, Cupidinesque!  Passing  Flawless as Aphrodite,Thoroughly beautiful,Brainless,The faint odor of your patchouli,Faint, almost, as the lines of cruelty about your chin,Assails me, and concerns me almost as little.

I have done it again.   
One year in every ten   
I manage it—— 
A sort of walking miracle, my skin   
Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   
My right foot 
A paperweight,
My face a featureless, fine   
Jew linen. 
Peel off the napkin   
O my enemy.   
Do I terrify?—— 
The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   
The sour breath
Will vanish in a day. 
Soon, soon the flesh
The grave cave ate will be   
At home on me 
And I a smiling woman.   
I am only thirty.
And like the cat I have nine times to die. 
This is Number Three.   
What a trash
To annihilate each decade. 
What a million filaments.   
The peanut-crunching crowd   
Shoves in to see 
Them unwrap me hand and foot——
The big strip tease.   
Gentlemen, ladies 
These are my hands   
My knees.
I may be skin and bone, 
Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   
The first time it happened I was ten.   
It was an accident. 
The second time I meant
To last it out and not come back at all.   
I rocked shut 
As a seashell.
They had to call and call
And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls. 
Dying
Is an art, like everything else.   
I do it exceptionally well. 
I do it so it feels like hell.   
I do it so it feels real.
I guess you could say I’ve a call. 
It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.
It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.   
It’s the theatrical 
Comeback in broad day
To the same place, the same face, the same brute   
Amused shout: 
‘A miracle!’
That knocks me out.   
There is a charge 
For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   
For the hearing of my heart——
It really goes. 
And there is a charge, a very large charge   
For a word or a touch   
Or a bit of blood 
Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   
So, so, Herr Doktor.   
So, Herr Enemy. 
I am your opus,
I am your valuable,   
The pure gold baby 
That melts to a shriek.   
I turn and burn.
Do not think I underestimate your great concern. 
Ash, ash—
You poke and stir.
Flesh, bone, there is nothing there—— 
A cake of soap,   
A wedding ring,   
A gold filling. 
Herr God, Herr Lucifer   
Beware
Beware. 
Out of the ash
I rise with my red hair   
And I eat men like air.

Five hours, (and who can do it less in?) By haughty Celia spent in dressing; The goddess from her chamber issues, Arrayed in lace, brocades and tissues.          Strephon, who found the room was void, And Betty otherwise employed, Stole in, and took a strict survey, Of all the litter as it lay; Whereof, to make the matter clear, An inventory follows here.          And first a dirty smock appeared, Beneath the armpits well besmeared. Strephon, the rogue, displayed it wide, And turned it round on every side. On such a point few words are best, And Strephon bids us guess the rest, But swears how damnably the men lie, In calling Celia sweet and cleanly. Now listen while he next produces The various combs for various uses, Filled up with dirt so closely fixt, No brush could force a way betwixt. A paste of composition rare, Sweat, dandruff, powder, lead and hair; A forehead cloth with oil upon’t To smooth the wrinkles on her front; Here alum flower to stop the steams, Exhaled from sour unsavory streams, There night-gloves made of Tripsy’s hide, Bequeathed by Tripsy when she died, With puppy water, beauty’s help Distilled from Tripsy’s darling whelp; Here gallypots and vials placed, Some filled with washes, some with paste, Some with pomatum, paints and slops, And ointments good for scabby chops. Hard by a filthy basin stands, Fouled with the scouring of her hands; The basin takes whatever comes The scrapings of her teeth and gums, A nasty compound of all hues, For here she spits, and here she spews. But oh! it turned poor Strephon’s bowels, When he beheld and smelled the towels, Begummed, bemattered, and beslimed With dirt, and sweat, and earwax grimed. No object Strephon’s eye escapes, Here petticoats in frowzy heaps; Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot All varnished o’er with snuff and snot. The stockings why should I expose, Stained with the marks of stinking toes; Or greasy coifs and pinners reeking, Which Celia slept at least a week in? A pair of tweezers next he found To pluck her brows in arches round, Or hairs that sink the forehead low, Or on her chin like bristles grow.          The virtues we must not let pass, Of Celia’s magnifying glass. When frightened Strephon cast his eye on’t It showed visage of a giant. A glass that can to sight disclose, The smallest worm in Celia’s nose, And faithfully direct her nail To squeeze it out from head to tail; For catch it nicely by the head, It must come out alive or dead.          Why Strephon will you tell the rest? And must you needs describe the chest? That careless wench! no creature warn her To move it out from yonder corner; But leave it standing full in sight For you to exercise your spite. In vain the workman showed his wit With rings and hinges counterfeit To make it seem in this disguise A cabinet to vulgar eyes; For Strephon ventured to look in, Resolved to go through thick and thin; He lifts the lid, there needs no more, He smelled it all the time before. As from within Pandora’s box, When Epimetheus op’d the locks, A sudden universal crew Of human evils upwards flew; He still was comforted to find That Hope at last remained behind; So Strephon lifting up the lid, To view what in the chest was hid. The vapors flew from out the vent, But Strephon cautious never meant The bottom of the pan to grope, And foul his hands in search of Hope. O never may such vile machine Be once in Celia’s chamber seen! O may she better learn to keep Those “secrets of the hoary deep!”          As mutton cutlets, prime of meat, Which though with art you salt and beat As laws of cookery require, And toast them at the clearest fire; If from adown the hopeful chops The fat upon a cinder drops, To stinking smoke it turns the flame Pois’ning the flesh from whence it came, And up exhales a greasy stench, For which you curse the careless wench; So things, which must not be expressed, When plumped into the reeking chest, Send up an excremental smell To taint the parts from whence they fell. The petticoats and gown perfume, Which waft a stink round every room. Thus finishing his grand survey, Disgusted Strephon stole away Repeating in his amorous fits, Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits!          But Vengeance, goddess never sleeping Soon punished Strephon for his peeping; His foul imagination links Each Dame he sees with all her stinks: And, if unsavory odors fly, Conceives a lady standing by: All women his description fits, And both ideas jump like wits: But vicious fancy coupled fast, And still appearing in contrast. I pity wretched Strephon blind To all the charms of female kind; Should I the queen of love refuse, Because she rose from stinking ooze? To him that looks behind the scene, Satira’s but some pocky queen. When Celia in her glory shows, If Strephon would but stop his nose (Who now so impiously blasphemes Her ointments, daubs, and paints and creams, Her washes, slops, and every clout, With which he makes so foul a rout) He soon would learn to think like me, And bless his ravished sight to see Such order from confusion sprung, Such gaudy tulips raised from dung.

From The Fire-worshippers



“How sweetly,” said the trembling maid, Of her own gentle voice afraid, So long had they in silence stood, Looking upon that tranquil flood— “How sweetly does the moon-beam smile To-night upon yon leafy isle! Oft in my fancy’s wanderings, I’ve wish’d that little isle had wings, And we, within its fairy bow’rs,       Were wafted off to seas unknown, Where not a pulse should beat but ours,       And we might live, love, die alone! Far from the cruel and the cold,—       Where the bright eyes of angels only Should come around us, to behold       A paradise so pure and lonely. Would this be world enough for thee?”— Playful she turn’d, that he might see       The passing smile her cheek put on; But when she mark’d how mournfully       His eyes met hers, that smile was gone; And, bursting into heart-felt tears, “Yes, yes,” she cried, “my hourly fears My dreams have boded all too right— We part—for ever part—to-night! I knew, I knew it  could not last— ’Twas bright, ’twas heav’nly, but ’tis past! Oh! ever thus, from childhood’s hour, I’ve seen my fondest hopes decay; I never lov’d a tree or flow’r,       But ’twas the first to fade away. I never nurs’d a dear gazelle       To glad me with its soft black eye, But when it came to know me well       And love me, it was sure to die! Now too—the joy most like divine       Of all I ever dreamt or knew, To see thee, hear thee, call thee mine,—       Oh misery! must I lose  that too? Yet go—on peril’s brink we meet;—       Those frightful rocks—that treach’rous sea— No, never come again—though sweet,       Though heav’n, it may be death to thee. Farewell—and blessings on thy way,       Where’er thou goest, beloved stranger! Better to sit and watch that ray, And think thee safe, though far away,       Than have thee near me, and in danger!”

Your dying was a difficult enterprise.
First, petty things took up your energies,
The small but clustering duties of the sick,   
Irritant as the cough’s dry rhetoric.
Those hours of waiting for pills, shot, X-ray   
Or test (while you read novels two a day)   
Already with a kind of clumsy stealth
Distanced you from the habits of your health.
    In hope still, courteous still, but tired and thin,   
You tried to stay the man that you had been,   
Treating each symptom as a mere mishap   
Without import. But then the spinal tap.
It brought a hard headache, and when night came   
I heard you wake up from the same bad dream   
Every half-hour with the same short cry
Of mild outrage, before immediately
Slipping into the nightmare once again
Empty of content but the drip of pain.
No respite followed: though the nightmare ceased,   
Your cough grew thick and rich, its strength increased.   
Four nights, and on the fifth we drove you down   
To the Emergency Room. That frown, that frown:   
I’d never seen such rage in you before
As when they wheeled you through the swinging door.   
For you knew, rightly, they conveyed you from   
Those normal pleasures of the sun’s kingdom   
The hedonistic body basks within
And takes for granted—summer on the skin,   
Sleep without break, the moderate taste of tea   
In a dry mouth. You had gone on from me
As if your body sought out martyrdom   
In the far Canada of a hospital room.   
Once there, you entered fully the distress   
And long pale rigours of the wilderness.   
A gust of morphine hid you. Back in sight
You breathed through a segmented tube, fat, white,   
Jammed down your throat so that you could not speak.
    How thin the distance made you. In your cheek   
One day, appeared the true shape of your bone   
No longer padded. Still your mind, alone,   
Explored this emptying intermediate   
State for what holds and rests were hidden in it.
    You wrote us messages on a pad, amused   
At one time that you had your nurse confused   
Who, seeing you reconciled after four years   
With your grey father, both of you in tears,   
Asked if this was at last your ‘special friend’
(The one you waited for until the end).   
‘She sings,’ you wrote, ‘a Philippine folk song   
To wake me in the morning ... It is long   
And very pretty.’ Grabbing at detail   
To furnish this bare ledge toured by the gale,   
On which you lay, bed restful as a knife,   
You tried, tried hard, to make of it a life   
Thick with the complicating circumstance
Your thoughts might fasten on. It had been chance   
Always till now that had filled up the moment   
With live specifics your hilarious comment   
Discovered as it went along; and fed,   
Laconic, quick, wherever it was led.   
You improvised upon your own delight.   
I think back to the scented summer night   
We talked between our sleeping bags, below
A molten field of stars five years ago:
I was so tickled by your mind’s light touch
I couldn’t sleep, you made me laugh too much,   
Though I was tired and begged you to leave off. 
Now you were tired, and yet not tired enough
—Still hungry for the great world you were losing   
Steadily in no season of your choosing—
And when at last the whole death was assured,   
Drugs having failed, and when you had endured   
Two weeks of an abominable constraint,   
You faced it equably, without complaint,   
Unwhimpering, but not at peace with it.   
You’d lived as if your time was infinite:   
You were not ready and not reconciled,   
Feeling as uncompleted as a child
Till you had shown the world what you could do   
In some ambitious role to be worked through,   
A role your need for it had half-defined,   
But never wholly, even in your mind.   
You lacked the necessary ruthlessness,   
The soaring meanness that pinpoints success.   
We loved that lack of self-love, and your smile,   
Rueful, at your own silliness.
                                              Meanwhile,
Your lungs collapsed, and the machine, unstrained,   
Did all your breathing now. Nothing remained   
But death by drowning on an inland sea   
Of your own fluids, which it seemed could be   
Kindly forestalled by drugs. Both could and would:   
Nothing was said, everything understood,   
At least by us. Your own concerns were not   
Long-term, precisely, when they gave the shot
—You made local arrangements to the bed   
And pulled a pillow round beside your head.
    And so you slept, and died, your skin gone grey,   
Achieving your completeness, in a way. 
Outdoors next day, I was dizzy from a sense   
Of being ejected with some violence
From vigil in a white and distant spot   
Where I was numb, into this garden plot
Too warm, too close, and not enough like pain.   
I was delivered into time again
—The variations that I live among
Where your long body too used to belong   
And where the still bush is minutely active.   
You never thought your body was attractive,   
Though others did, and yet you trusted it   
And must have loved its fickleness a bit
Since it was yours and gave you what it could,   
Till near the end it let you down for good,   
Its blood hospitable to those guests who   
Took over by betraying it into
The greatest of its inconsistencies
This difficult, tedious, painful enterprise.

For Christopher Merrill



Swear by the olive in the God-kissed land—
There is no sugar in the promised land. 
Why must the bars turn neon now when, Love,   
I’m already drunk in your capitalist land? 
If home is found on both sides of the globe,
home is of course here—and always a missed land. 
The hour’s come to redeem the pledge (not wholly?)   
in Fate’s "Long years ago we made a tryst" land. 
Clearly, these men were here only to destroy,   
a mosque now the dust of a prejudiced land. 
Will the Doomsayers die, bitten with envy,   
when springtime returns to our dismissed land? 
The prisons fill with the cries of children.
Then how do you subsist, how do you persist, Land? 
“Is my love nothing for I’ve borne no children?”
I’m with you, Sappho, in that anarchist land. 
A hurricane is born when the wings flutter ...   
Where will the butterfly, on my wrist, land? 
You made me wait for one who wasn’t even there   
though summer had finished in that tourist land. 
Do the blind hold temples close to their eyes   
when we steal their gods for our atheist land? 
Abandoned bride, Night throws down her jewels   
so Rome—on our descent—is an amethyst land. 
At the moment the heart turns terrorist,
are Shahid’s arms broken, O Promised Land?

A huge sound waits, bound in the ice,
in the icicle roots, in the buds of snow
on fir branches, in the falling silence
of snow, glittering in the sun, brilliant
as a swarm of gnats, nothing but hovering
wings at midday. With the sun comes noise.
Tongues of ice break free, fall, shatter,
splinter, speak. If I could write the words. 
Simple, like turning a page, to say Write
what happened

It may be through some foreign grace, And unfamiliar charm of face; It may be that across the foamWhich bore her from her childhood’s home, By some strange spell, my Katie brought, Along with English creeds and thought—Entangled in her golden hair—Some English sunshine, warmth, and air! I cannot tell—but here to-day, A thousand billowy leagues away From that green isle whose twilight skiesNo darker are than Katie’s eyes,She seems to me, go where she will, An English girl in England still;
I meet her on the dusty street, And daisies spring about her feet;Or, touched to life beneath her tread, An English cowslip lifts its head;And, as to do her grace, rise up The primrose and the buttercup!I roam with her through fields of cane, And seem to stroll an English lane, Which, white with blossoms of the May, Spreads its green carpet in her way! As fancy wills, the path beneath Is golden gorse, or purple heath: And now we hear in woodlands dim Their unarticulated hymn,Now walk through rippling waves of wheat, Now sink in mats of clover sweet, Or see before us from the lawn The lark go up to greet the dawn! All birds that love the English sky Throng round my path when she is by: The blackbird from a neighboring thorn With music brims the cup of morn, And in a thick, melodious rain The mavis pours her mellow strain! But only when my Katie’s voice Makes all the listening woods rejoice I hear—with cheeks that flush and pale—The passion of the nightingale!
Anon the pictures round her change, And through an ancient town we range, Whereto the shadowy memory clings Of one of England’s Saxon kings, And which to shrine his fading fame Still keeps his ashes and his name. Quaint houses rise on either hand, But still the airs are fresh and bland, As if their gentle wings caressed Some new-born village of the West. A moment by the Norman tower We pause; it is the Sabbath hour! And o’er the city sinks and swells The chime of old St. Mary’s bells, Which still resound in Katie’s earsAs sweet as when in distant years She heard them peal with jocund din A merry English Christmas in! We pass the abbey’s ruined arch, And statelier grows my Katie’s march, As round her, wearied with the taint Of Transatlantic pine and paint, She sees a thousand tokens cast Of England’s venerable Past! Our reverent footsteps lastly claims The younger chapel of St. James, Which though, as English records run, Not old, had seen full many a sun, Ere to the cold December gale The sullen Pilgrim spread his sail. There Katie in her childish daysSpelt out her prayers and lisped her praise, And doubtless, as her beauty grew, Did much as other maidens do—Across the pews and down the aisle Sent many a beau-bewildering smile, And to subserve her spirit’s need Learned other things beside the creed! There, too, to-day her knee she bows, And by her one whose darker brows Betray the Southern heart that burns Beside her, and which only turns Its thoughts to Heaven in one request, Not all unworthy to be blest, But rising from an earthlier pain Than might beseem a Christian fane. Ah! can the guileless maiden share The wish that lifts that passionate prayer? Is all at peace that breast within? Good angels! warn her of the sin! Alas! what boots it? who can save A willing victim of the wave? Who cleanse a soul that loves its guilt? Or gather wine when wine is spilt?
We quit the holy house and gain The open air; then, happy twain, Adown familiar streets we go,And now and then she turns to show, With fears that all is changing fast, Some spot that’s sacred to her Past.Here by this way, through shadows cool,A little maid, she tripped to school; And there each morning used to stop Before a wonder of a shopWhere, built of apples and of pears, Rose pyramids of golden spheres; While, dangling in her dazzled sight, Ripe cherries cast a crimson light, And made her think of elfin lamps, And feast and sport in fairy camps, Whereat, upon her royal throne (Most richly carved in cherry-stone), Titania ruled, in queenly state, The boisterous revels of the fête!’T was yonder, with their “horrid” noise, Dismissed from books, she met the boys, Who, with a barbarous scorn of girls, Glanced slightly at her sunny curls, And laughed and leaped as reckless by As though no pretty face were nigh! But—here the maiden grows demure—Indeed she’s not so very sure, That in a year, or haply twain, Few looked who failed to look again, And sooth to say, I little doubt (Some azure day, the truth will out!) That certain baits in certain eyes Caught many an unsuspecting prize; And somewhere underneath these eaves A budding flirt put forth its leaves!
Has not the sky a deeper blue, Have not the trees a greener hue,And bend they not with lordlier graceAnd nobler shapes above the place Where on one cloudless winter morn My Katie to this life was born? Ah, folly! long hath fled the hour When love to sight gave keener power, And lovers looked for special boons In brighter flowers and larger moons. But wave the foliage as it may, And let the sky be ashen gray, Thus much at least a manly youthMay hold—and yet not blush—as truth: If near that blessed spot of earth Which saw the cherished maiden’s birth No softer dews than usual rise, And life there keeps its wonted guise, Yet not the less that spot may seem As lovely as a poet’s dream;And should a fervid faith incline To make thereof a sainted shrine, Who may deny that round us throng A hundred earthly creeds as wrong, But meaner far, which yet unblamed Stalk by us and are not ashamed. So, therefore, Katie, as our stroll Ends at this portal, while you roll Those lustrous eyes to catch each ray That may recall some vanished day,I—let them jeer and laugh who will—Stoop down and kiss the sacred sill!
So strongly sometimes on the sense These fancies hold their influence,That in long well-known streets I stray Like one who fears to lose his way. The stranger, I, the native, she,Myself, not Kate, have crossed the sea; And changing place, and mixing times, I walk in unfamiliar climes!These houses, free to every breeze That blows from warm Floridian seas,Assume a massive English air,And close around an English square; While, if I issue from the town, An English hill looks greenly down, Or round me rolls an English park, And in the Broad I hear the Larke! Thus when, where woodland violets hide, I rove with Katie at my side,It scarce would seem amiss to say, “Katie! my home lies far away, Beyond the pathless waste of brine, In a young land of palm and pine! There, by the tropic heats, the soul Is touched as if with living coal, And glows with such a fire as none Can feel beneath a Northern sun, Unless—my Katie’s heart attest!—’T is kindled in an English breast! Such is the land in which I live, And, Katie! such the soul I give. Come! ere another morning beam, We’ll cleave the sea with wings of steam; And soon, despite of storm or calm, Beneath my native groves of palm,Kind friends shall greet, with joy and pride, The Southron and his English bride!”

I drove through the narrow Gods—
privet and cholesterol, or   
Irish creamery butter as the waiter 
called it, as it shaved another day   
off my life. There was no salt   
and antimony, just lumpy roads 
through Meath and Leitrim.   
The sky was a show of flashing   
mirrors as day broke on Rosses. 
Tide out and weed like cow pies   
on the shore. The punt down and   
the EEC on the horizon, 
as I read in the guidebook about pilgrims   
climbing St. Patrick’s barefoot   
every summer. 
Out of the fog a man in Wranglers and   
spurred boots, clean-shaven, a cigarette   
in hand, waved me down.  “Scrum faced house at the end of the bay.”   
“Hop in,” I said. “You lookin’

FOR BAILEY



We were entwined in red rings   
Of blood and loneliness before   
The first snows fell
Before muddy rivers seeded clouds   
Above a virgin forest, and   
Men ran naked, blue and black   
Skinned into the warm embraces   
Of Sheba, Eve and Lilith.
I was your sister. 
You left me to force strangers   
Into brother molds, exacting   
Taxations they never
Owed or could ever pay. 
You fought to die, thinking   
In destruction lies the seed   
Of birth. You may be right. 
I will remember silent walks in   
Southern woods and long talks   
In low voices
Shielding meaning from the big ears   
Of overcurious adults. 
You may be right.   
Your slow return from
Regions of terror and bloody
Screams, races my heart.
I hear again the laughter   
Of children and see fireflies   
Bursting tiny explosions in   
An Arkansas twilight.

Kind are her answers,
 But her performance keeps no day;
 Breaks time, as dancers
 From their own music when they stray:
 All her free favorsAnd smooth words wing my hopes in vain.O did ever voice so sweet but only feign?
 Can true love yield such delay,
 Converting joy to pain?
  Lost is our freedom,
 When we submit to women so:
 Why do we need ’em,
 When in their best they work our woe?
 There is no wisdomCan alter ends, by Fate prefixed.O why is the good of man with evil mixed?
 Never were days yet called two,
 But one night went betwixt.

I will have been walking away:
no matter what direction I intended,
at that moment, I will have been walking 
Away into the direction that you now say
I have always intended, no matter what my
intention was then, I will have been 
Walking away, though it will not be clear
what it was that I was leaving or
even why, it seems that you will say 
That always, I was walking away,
intending a direction that was not towards
you, but moving away with every step, 
Or, even when I pretended to be walking
towards you, only making the place
for my feet to go backwards, 
Away, where I will have been walking,
always away:   intention and direction
unknown, but knowing you will always
say I will have been walking away.

The kindergarten concert was an interesting show.
Peter walked onto the stage and yelled, “I have to go!”
Katie was embarrassed, but she had nowhere to hide.
She raised her dress to hide her face. Her mother almost died.
Keith removed his tie and said, “It’s ugly, Dad. I hate it!”
David picked his nose on stage. What’s worse is that he ate it.
They sang their song, and Wyatt burped. Then he did a dance.
Michael fell while spinning ’round. Peter wet his pants.
The music teacher at the end said, “There, I’m glad that’s done.”
The kindergarten bowed and said, “Let’s sing another one!”

In a year the nightingales were said to be so loud
they drowned out slumber, and peafowl strolled screaming   
beside the ruined nunnery, through the long evening   
of a dazzled pub crawl, the halcyon color, portholed   
by those eye-spots’ stunning tapestry, unsettled
the pastoral nightfall with amazements opening. 
Months later, intermission in a pub on Fifty-fifth Street   
found one of them still breathless, the other quizzical,   
acting the philistine, puncturing Stravinsky—“Tell   
me, what was that racket in the orchestra about?”—
hauling down the Firebird, harum-scarum, like a kite,   
a burnished, breathing wreck that didn’t hurt at all. 
Among the Bronx Zoo’s exiled jungle fowl, they heard   
through headphones of a separating panic, the bellbird   
reiterate its single chong, a scream nobody answered.   
When he mourned, “The poetry is gone,” she quailed,   
seeing how his hands shook, sobered into feeling old.   
By midnight, yet another fifth would have been killed. 
A Sunday morning, the November of their cataclysm   
(Dylan Thomas brought in in extremis to St. Vincent’s,   
that same week, a symptomatic datum) found them   
wandering a downtown churchyard. Among its headstones,   
while from unruined choirs the noise of Christendom   
poured over Wall Street, a benison in vestments, 
a late thrush paused, in transit from some grizzled   
spruce bog to the humid equatorial fireside: berry-
eyed, bark-brown above, with dark hints of trauma   
in the stigmata of its underparts—or so, too bruised   
just then to have invented anything so fancy,
later, re-embroidering a retrospect, she had supposed. 
In gray England, years of muted recrimination (then   
dead silence) later, she could not have said how many   
spoiled takeoffs, how many entanglements gone sodden,   
how many gaudy evenings made frantic by just one   
insomniac nightingale, how many liaisons gone down   
screaming in a stroll beside the ruined nunnery; 
a kingfisher’s burnished plunge, the color   
of felicity afire, came glancing like an arrow   
through landscapes of untended memory: ardor   
illuminating with its terrifying currency
now no mere glimpse, no porthole vista
but, down on down, the uninhabitable sorrow.

Kiss’d yestreen, and kiss’d yestreen,Up the Gallowgate, down the Green:I’ve woo’d wi’ lords, and woo’d wi’ lairds,I’ve mool’d wi carles and mell’d wi’ cairds,I’ve kiss’d wi’ priests— ‘twas done i’ the dark,Twice in my gown and thrice in my sark;But priest, nor lord, nor loon can gieSic kindly kisses as he gae me.

My breasts are small and my eyes round.   
Your legs long and cool as the freshet
that runs down from the fountain.
I bite your neck,
it’s sturdy, still not yet ripe,
like a walnut that has just now fallen.
You clamber on top, start kissing my middle,   
strew wet wavelets all over my skin,
now up here, now down there,
like the first fat drops to fall before
the storm starts, splat, splat, splat. 
We’ve gone to sleep back to chest,   
the way lips rejoin   
after sighing.


^^EOP^^

Though I with strange desireTo kiss those rosy lips am set on fire,Yet will I cease to craveSweet touches in such store,As he who long beforeFrom Lesbia them in thousands did receive.Heart mine, but once me kiss,And I by that sweet blissEven swear to cease you to importune more;Poor one no number is;Another word of me ye shall not hearAfter one kiss, but still one kiss, my dear.

A few light flakes of snow
Fall in the feeble sun;
Birds sing in the cold,
A warbler by the wall. The plum
Buds tight and chill soon bloom.
The moon begins first
Fourth, a faint slice west
At nightfall. Jupiter half-way
High at the end of night-
Meditation. The dove cry
Twangs like a bow.
At dawn Mt. Hiei dusted white
On top; in the clear air
Folds of all the gullied green
Hills around the town are sharp,
Breath stings. Beneath the roofs
Of frosty houses
Lovers part, from tangle warm
Of gentle bodies under quilt
And crack the icy water to the face
And wake and feed the children
And grandchildren that they love.

Is it because your sable hairIs folded over brows that wear At times a too imperial air;
Or is it that the thoughts which riseIn those dark orbs do seek disguise Beneath the lids of Eastern eyes;
That choose whatever pose or place May chance to please, in you I trace The noblest women of your race?
The crowd is sauntering at its ease, And humming like a hive of bees—You take your seat and touch the keys.
I do not hear the giddy throng; The sea avenges Israel’s wrong,And on the wind floats Miriam’s song!
You join me with a stately grace; Music to Poesy gives place;Some grand emotion lights your face.
At once I stand by Mizpeh’s walls; With smiles the martyred daughter falls, And desolate are Mizpeh’s halls!
Intrusive babblers come between;With calm, pale brow and lofty mien, You thread the circle like a queen!
Then sweeps the royal Esther by; The deep devotion in her eye Is looking “If I die, I die!”
You stroll the garden’s flowery walks; The plants to me are grainless stalks, And Ruth to old Naomi talks.
Adopted child of Judah’s creed,Like Judah’s daughters, true at need, I see you mid the alien seed.
I watch afar the gleaner sweet; I wake like Boaz in the wheat, And find you lying at my feet!
My feet! Oh! if the spell that luresMy heart through all these dreams endures, How soon shall I be stretched at yours!

Agathas  Four and forty lovers had Agathas in the old days,All of whom she refused;
And now she turns to me seeking love,And her hair also is turning.
Young Lady  I have fed your lar with poppies,I have adored you for three full years;And now you grumble because your dress does not fitAnd because I happen to say so.
Lesbia Illa  Memnon, Memnon, that ladyWho used to walk about amongst usWith such gracious uncertainty,Is now weddedTo a British householder.Lugete, Veneres! Lugete, Cupidinesque!  Passing  Flawless as Aphrodite,Thoroughly beautiful,Brainless,The faint odor of your patchouli,Faint, almost, as the lines of cruelty about your chin,Assails me, and concerns me almost as little.

I have done it again.   
One year in every ten   
I manage it—— 
A sort of walking miracle, my skin   
Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   
My right foot 
A paperweight,
My face a featureless, fine   
Jew linen. 
Peel off the napkin   
O my enemy.   
Do I terrify?—— 
The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   
The sour breath
Will vanish in a day. 
Soon, soon the flesh
The grave cave ate will be   
At home on me 
And I a smiling woman.   
I am only thirty.
And like the cat I have nine times to die. 
This is Number Three.   
What a trash
To annihilate each decade. 
What a million filaments.   
The peanut-crunching crowd   
Shoves in to see 
Them unwrap me hand and foot——
The big strip tease.   
Gentlemen, ladies 
These are my hands   
My knees.
I may be skin and bone, 
Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   
The first time it happened I was ten.   
It was an accident. 
The second time I meant
To last it out and not come back at all.   
I rocked shut 
As a seashell.
They had to call and call
And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls. 
Dying
Is an art, like everything else.   
I do it exceptionally well. 
I do it so it feels like hell.   
I do it so it feels real.
I guess you could say I’ve a call. 
It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.
It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.   
It’s the theatrical 
Comeback in broad day
To the same place, the same face, the same brute   
Amused shout: 
‘A miracle!’
That knocks me out.   
There is a charge 
For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   
For the hearing of my heart——
It really goes. 
And there is a charge, a very large charge   
For a word or a touch   
Or a bit of blood 
Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   
So, so, Herr Doktor.   
So, Herr Enemy. 
I am your opus,
I am your valuable,   
The pure gold baby 
That melts to a shriek.   
I turn and burn.
Do not think I underestimate your great concern. 
Ash, ash—
You poke and stir.
Flesh, bone, there is nothing there—— 
A cake of soap,   
A wedding ring,   
A gold filling. 
Herr God, Herr Lucifer   
Beware
Beware. 
Out of the ash
I rise with my red hair   
And I eat men like air.

Five hours, (and who can do it less in?) By haughty Celia spent in dressing; The goddess from her chamber issues, Arrayed in lace, brocades and tissues.          Strephon, who found the room was void, And Betty otherwise employed, Stole in, and took a strict survey, Of all the litter as it lay; Whereof, to make the matter clear, An inventory follows here.          And first a dirty smock appeared, Beneath the armpits well besmeared. Strephon, the rogue, displayed it wide, And turned it round on every side. On such a point few words are best, And Strephon bids us guess the rest, But swears how damnably the men lie, In calling Celia sweet and cleanly. Now listen while he next produces The various combs for various uses, Filled up with dirt so closely fixt, No brush could force a way betwixt. A paste of composition rare, Sweat, dandruff, powder, lead and hair; A forehead cloth with oil upon’t To smooth the wrinkles on her front; Here alum flower to stop the steams, Exhaled from sour unsavory streams, There night-gloves made of Tripsy’s hide, Bequeathed by Tripsy when she died, With puppy water, beauty’s help Distilled from Tripsy’s darling whelp; Here gallypots and vials placed, Some filled with washes, some with paste, Some with pomatum, paints and slops, And ointments good for scabby chops. Hard by a filthy basin stands, Fouled with the scouring of her hands; The basin takes whatever comes The scrapings of her teeth and gums, A nasty compound of all hues, For here she spits, and here she spews. But oh! it turned poor Strephon’s bowels, When he beheld and smelled the towels, Begummed, bemattered, and beslimed With dirt, and sweat, and earwax grimed. No object Strephon’s eye escapes, Here petticoats in frowzy heaps; Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot All varnished o’er with snuff and snot. The stockings why should I expose, Stained with the marks of stinking toes; Or greasy coifs and pinners reeking, Which Celia slept at least a week in? A pair of tweezers next he found To pluck her brows in arches round, Or hairs that sink the forehead low, Or on her chin like bristles grow.          The virtues we must not let pass, Of Celia’s magnifying glass. When frightened Strephon cast his eye on’t It showed visage of a giant. A glass that can to sight disclose, The smallest worm in Celia’s nose, And faithfully direct her nail To squeeze it out from head to tail; For catch it nicely by the head, It must come out alive or dead.          Why Strephon will you tell the rest? And must you needs describe the chest? That careless wench! no creature warn her To move it out from yonder corner; But leave it standing full in sight For you to exercise your spite. In vain the workman showed his wit With rings and hinges counterfeit To make it seem in this disguise A cabinet to vulgar eyes; For Strephon ventured to look in, Resolved to go through thick and thin; He lifts the lid, there needs no more, He smelled it all the time before. As from within Pandora’s box, When Epimetheus op’d the locks, A sudden universal crew Of human evils upwards flew; He still was comforted to find That Hope at last remained behind; So Strephon lifting up the lid, To view what in the chest was hid. The vapors flew from out the vent, But Strephon cautious never meant The bottom of the pan to grope, And foul his hands in search of Hope. O never may such vile machine Be once in Celia’s chamber seen! O may she better learn to keep Those “secrets of the hoary deep!”          As mutton cutlets, prime of meat, Which though with art you salt and beat As laws of cookery require, And toast them at the clearest fire; If from adown the hopeful chops The fat upon a cinder drops, To stinking smoke it turns the flame Pois’ning the flesh from whence it came, And up exhales a greasy stench, For which you curse the careless wench; So things, which must not be expressed, When plumped into the reeking chest, Send up an excremental smell To taint the parts from whence they fell. The petticoats and gown perfume, Which waft a stink round every room. Thus finishing his grand survey, Disgusted Strephon stole away Repeating in his amorous fits, Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits!          But Vengeance, goddess never sleeping Soon punished Strephon for his peeping; His foul imagination links Each Dame he sees with all her stinks: And, if unsavory odors fly, Conceives a lady standing by: All women his description fits, And both ideas jump like wits: But vicious fancy coupled fast, And still appearing in contrast. I pity wretched Strephon blind To all the charms of female kind; Should I the queen of love refuse, Because she rose from stinking ooze? To him that looks behind the scene, Satira’s but some pocky queen. When Celia in her glory shows, If Strephon would but stop his nose (Who now so impiously blasphemes Her ointments, daubs, and paints and creams, Her washes, slops, and every clout, With which he makes so foul a rout) He soon would learn to think like me, And bless his ravished sight to see Such order from confusion sprung, Such gaudy tulips raised from dung.

From The Fire-worshippers



“How sweetly,” said the trembling maid, Of her own gentle voice afraid, So long had they in silence stood, Looking upon that tranquil flood— “How sweetly does the moon-beam smile To-night upon yon leafy isle! Oft in my fancy’s wanderings, I’ve wish’d that little isle had wings, And we, within its fairy bow’rs,       Were wafted off to seas unknown, Where not a pulse should beat but ours,       And we might live, love, die alone! Far from the cruel and the cold,—       Where the bright eyes of angels only Should come around us, to behold       A paradise so pure and lonely. Would this be world enough for thee?”— Playful she turn’d, that he might see       The passing smile her cheek put on; But when she mark’d how mournfully       His eyes met hers, that smile was gone; And, bursting into heart-felt tears, “Yes, yes,” she cried, “my hourly fears My dreams have boded all too right— We part—for ever part—to-night! I knew, I knew it  could not last— ’Twas bright, ’twas heav’nly, but ’tis past! Oh! ever thus, from childhood’s hour, I’ve seen my fondest hopes decay; I never lov’d a tree or flow’r,       But ’twas the first to fade away. I never nurs’d a dear gazelle       To glad me with its soft black eye, But when it came to know me well       And love me, it was sure to die! Now too—the joy most like divine       Of all I ever dreamt or knew, To see thee, hear thee, call thee mine,—       Oh misery! must I lose  that too? Yet go—on peril’s brink we meet;—       Those frightful rocks—that treach’rous sea— No, never come again—though sweet,       Though heav’n, it may be death to thee. Farewell—and blessings on thy way,       Where’er thou goest, beloved stranger! Better to sit and watch that ray, And think thee safe, though far away,       Than have thee near me, and in danger!”

Your dying was a difficult enterprise.
First, petty things took up your energies,
The small but clustering duties of the sick,   
Irritant as the cough’s dry rhetoric.
Those hours of waiting for pills, shot, X-ray   
Or test (while you read novels two a day)   
Already with a kind of clumsy stealth
Distanced you from the habits of your health.
    In hope still, courteous still, but tired and thin,   
You tried to stay the man that you had been,   
Treating each symptom as a mere mishap   
Without import. But then the spinal tap.
It brought a hard headache, and when night came   
I heard you wake up from the same bad dream   
Every half-hour with the same short cry
Of mild outrage, before immediately
Slipping into the nightmare once again
Empty of content but the drip of pain.
No respite followed: though the nightmare ceased,   
Your cough grew thick and rich, its strength increased.   
Four nights, and on the fifth we drove you down   
To the Emergency Room. That frown, that frown:   
I’d never seen such rage in you before
As when they wheeled you through the swinging door.   
For you knew, rightly, they conveyed you from   
Those normal pleasures of the sun’s kingdom   
The hedonistic body basks within
And takes for granted—summer on the skin,   
Sleep without break, the moderate taste of tea   
In a dry mouth. You had gone on from me
As if your body sought out martyrdom   
In the far Canada of a hospital room.   
Once there, you entered fully the distress   
And long pale rigours of the wilderness.   
A gust of morphine hid you. Back in sight
You breathed through a segmented tube, fat, white,   
Jammed down your throat so that you could not speak.
    How thin the distance made you. In your cheek   
One day, appeared the true shape of your bone   
No longer padded. Still your mind, alone,   
Explored this emptying intermediate   
State for what holds and rests were hidden in it.
    You wrote us messages on a pad, amused   
At one time that you had your nurse confused   
Who, seeing you reconciled after four years   
With your grey father, both of you in tears,   
Asked if this was at last your ‘special friend’
(The one you waited for until the end).   
‘She sings,’ you wrote, ‘a Philippine folk song   
To wake me in the morning ... It is long   
And very pretty.’ Grabbing at detail   
To furnish this bare ledge toured by the gale,   
On which you lay, bed restful as a knife,   
You tried, tried hard, to make of it a life   
Thick with the complicating circumstance
Your thoughts might fasten on. It had been chance   
Always till now that had filled up the moment   
With live specifics your hilarious comment   
Discovered as it went along; and fed,   
Laconic, quick, wherever it was led.   
You improvised upon your own delight.   
I think back to the scented summer night   
We talked between our sleeping bags, below
A molten field of stars five years ago:
I was so tickled by your mind’s light touch
I couldn’t sleep, you made me laugh too much,   
Though I was tired and begged you to leave off. 
Now you were tired, and yet not tired enough
—Still hungry for the great world you were losing   
Steadily in no season of your choosing—
And when at last the whole death was assured,   
Drugs having failed, and when you had endured   
Two weeks of an abominable constraint,   
You faced it equably, without complaint,   
Unwhimpering, but not at peace with it.   
You’d lived as if your time was infinite:   
You were not ready and not reconciled,   
Feeling as uncompleted as a child
Till you had shown the world what you could do   
In some ambitious role to be worked through,   
A role your need for it had half-defined,   
But never wholly, even in your mind.   
You lacked the necessary ruthlessness,   
The soaring meanness that pinpoints success.   
We loved that lack of self-love, and your smile,   
Rueful, at your own silliness.
                                              Meanwhile,
Your lungs collapsed, and the machine, unstrained,   
Did all your breathing now. Nothing remained   
But death by drowning on an inland sea   
Of your own fluids, which it seemed could be   
Kindly forestalled by drugs. Both could and would:   
Nothing was said, everything understood,   
At least by us. Your own concerns were not   
Long-term, precisely, when they gave the shot
—You made local arrangements to the bed   
And pulled a pillow round beside your head.
    And so you slept, and died, your skin gone grey,   
Achieving your completeness, in a way. 
Outdoors next day, I was dizzy from a sense   
Of being ejected with some violence
From vigil in a white and distant spot   
Where I was numb, into this garden plot
Too warm, too close, and not enough like pain.   
I was delivered into time again
—The variations that I live among
Where your long body too used to belong   
And where the still bush is minutely active.   
You never thought your body was attractive,   
Though others did, and yet you trusted it   
And must have loved its fickleness a bit
Since it was yours and gave you what it could,   
Till near the end it let you down for good,   
Its blood hospitable to those guests who   
Took over by betraying it into
The greatest of its inconsistencies
This difficult, tedious, painful enterprise.

For Christopher Merrill



Swear by the olive in the God-kissed land—
There is no sugar in the promised land. 
Why must the bars turn neon now when, Love,   
I’m already drunk in your capitalist land? 
If home is found on both sides of the globe,
home is of course here—and always a missed land. 
The hour’s come to redeem the pledge (not wholly?)   
in Fate’s "Long years ago we made a tryst" land. 
Clearly, these men were here only to destroy,   
a mosque now the dust of a prejudiced land. 
Will the Doomsayers die, bitten with envy,   
when springtime returns to our dismissed land? 
The prisons fill with the cries of children.
Then how do you subsist, how do you persist, Land? 
“Is my love nothing for I’ve borne no children?”
I’m with you, Sappho, in that anarchist land. 
A hurricane is born when the wings flutter ...   
Where will the butterfly, on my wrist, land? 
You made me wait for one who wasn’t even there   
though summer had finished in that tourist land. 
Do the blind hold temples close to their eyes   
when we steal their gods for our atheist land? 
Abandoned bride, Night throws down her jewels   
so Rome—on our descent—is an amethyst land. 
At the moment the heart turns terrorist,
are Shahid’s arms broken, O Promised Land?

Boughs berserk
Spin one hill
Into space
Standing still
Olive trees race 
On the field below
Moulded white oxen
Ponder each furrow
A man behind them
Cries Via, Via

When you move away, you see how much depends
on the pace of the days—how much
depended on the haze we waded through
each summer, visible heat, wavy and discursive
as the lazy track of the snake in the dusty road;
and on the habit in town of porches thatched in vines,
and in the country long dense promenades, the way
we sacrificed the yards to shade.
It was partly the heat that made my father
plant so many trees—two maples marking the site
for the house, two elms on either side when it was done;
mimosa by the fence, and as it failed, fast-growing chestnuts,
loblolly pines; and dogwood, redbud, ornamental crab.
On the farm, everything else he grew
something could eat, but this
would be a permanent mark of his industry,
a glade established in the open field. Or so it seemed.
Looking back at the empty house from across the hill,
I see how well the house is camouflaged, see how
that porous fence of saplings, their later
scrim of foliage, thickened around it,
and still he chinked and mortared, planting more.
Last summer, although he’d lost all tolerance for heat,
he backed the truck in at the family grave
and stood in the truckbed all afternoon, pruning
the landmark oak, repairing recent damage by a wind;
then he came home and hung a swing
in one of the horse-chestnuts for my visit.
The heat was a hand at his throat,
a fist to his weak heart. But it made a triumph
of the cooler air inside, in the bedroom,
in the maple bedstead where he slept,
in the brick house nearly swamped by leaves.

Locate I
love you

^^EOP^^

Look in the mirror. Let us both look.
Here is my naked body.
Apparently you like it,
I have no reason to.
Who bound us, me and my body?
Why must I die
together with it?
I have the right to know where the borderline
between us is drawn.
Where am I, I, I myself. 
Belly, am I in the belly? In the intestines?
In the hollow of the sex? In a toe?
Apparently in the brain. I do not see it.
Take my brain out of my skull. I have the right
to see myself. Don’t laugh.
That’s macabre, you say. 
It’s not me who made
my body.
I wear the used rags of my family,
an alien brain, fruit of chance, hair
after my grandmother, the nose
glued together from a few dead noses.
What do I have in common with all that?
What do I have in common with you, who like
my knee, what is my knee to me? 
Surely
I would have chosen a different model. 
I will leave both of you here,
my knee and you.
Don’t make a wry face, I will leave you all my body
to play with.
And I will go.
There is no place for me here,
in this blind darkness waiting for
corruption.
I will run out, I will race
away from myself.
I will look for myself
running
like crazy
till my last breath. 
One must hurry
before death comes. For by then
like a dog jerked by its chain
I will have to return
into this stridently suffering body.
To go through the last
most strident ceremony of the body. 
Defeated by the body,
slowly annihilated because of the body 
I will become kidney failure
or the gangrene of the large intestine.
And I will expire in shame. 
And the universe will expire with me,
reduced as it is
to a kidney failure
and the gangrene of the large intestine.

Reading in the paper a summary
of a five-year psychological study
that shows those perceived as most beautiful
are treated differently, 
I think they could have just asked me, 
remembering a kind of pudgy kid
and late puberty, the bloody noses
and wisecracks because I wore glasses, 
though we all know by now how awful it is
for the busty starlet no one takes seriously,
the loveliest women I’ve lunched with
lamenting the opacity of the body, 
they can never trust a man’s interest
even when he seems not just out for sex
(eyes focus on me above rim of wineglass),
and who would want to live like this? 
And what does beauty do to a man?—
Don Juan, Casanova, Lord Byron—
those fiery eyes and steel jawlines
can front a furnace of self-loathing, 
all those breathless women rushing to him
while hubby’s at the office or ball game,
primed to be consumed by his beauty
while he stands next to it, watching. 
So maybe the looks we’re dealt are best.
It’s only common sense that happiness
depends on some bearable deprivation
or defect, and who knows what conflicts 
great beauty could have caused,
what cruelties one might have suffered
from those now friends, what unmanageable
possibilities smiling at every small turn? 
So if I get up to draw a tumbler
of ordinary tap water and think what if this were
nectar dripping from delicious burning fingers,

The unsigned architecture of loneliness
is becoming taller, finding a way farther
above the horizontal flowering
of the Cold War, the peonies
and star asters of wild partisanship.
I have a shambling gait and lonely
hysteria, but no Terror. I am free
to shamble past the vacant lot of my son’s
conception, to shamble past the bar where I
conceived adultery as a Terror
that would be endless, flowering
in great waves through air striated like chenille.
I walk for a long time and try to conjure
elsewhere in its early isolation.
I cannot. It is all redestinated
by the future like the loose balloons
a janitor recovers at 6 am
from cold light fixtures. The Cold War is ending.
Buildings are taller and have no names. 
1.
The romance of every ideology
torments the romance of another. How
beautifully, in the beginning, in
the gale and embrace of isolation, boys
capered over a shambles and swore oaths.
The scent of urine in the hall at home
was righteousness. The beautiful nude
obscured by dust in a paperweight
was righteousness. Neglectful townships coming
into steep flower just as boys were flowering
needed the correction of righteousness,   
the horizontal slag of government
by children. Only the insane allegiances
endure. The mad counterparts are lovers
passion cannot explain nor circumstances
restrict to the dead zones of irony.
A counterpart of end of the Cold War
is adultery. A counterpart
of loving a divided Berlin
unto death is fatherhood, the doting
maintenance of sons in vacant lots
continuing the wars of rubble
for righteousness’ sake and for the sake
of nudes obscured by dust and vulgarity. 
Romance torments romance. The most beautiful
moment of the twentieth century
galed and embraced the acrid smoky air
as the Red Army entered Berlin
as Hitler shriveled in the gasoline fire
as Red Army flags opened above Berlin
safeguarding the ruins of a changeless future.
Townships blackened even as they flowered.
Loose balloons cluttered the low sky and sun.
I walked for a long time and tried to conjure
the form of kindness. It was a domestic
animal confused in the tall grass.
Boys set fire to the grass. History
that opens flags opened the fire,
and Berlin, divided from Berlin,
began to love its children past all reason. 
2.
My son reads sermons of pain and writes on walls.
He starves the ground
he walks on, preparing a dead city
to be worthy of its new flags, to shine
as exploded windows shine, raining down
for hours after the wrecking crews have gone.
I have a lover now who hates children.
The hatred floats inside of her, a weightless
sexual pavilion of perfect form
and perfect emptiness. I thought
by making love to her I would conceive
nothing but Terror, outrage upon outrage,
a violence that would last my whole life
and free my son. I was ignorant as a balloon. 
Across the luminous expressway, I see
the shapes of charred tenements castellated,
fading into the more tender shapes of night.
It may be the last night in history. Tomorrow
pulls down the Berlin Wall, pulls down my honor,
and I return to my lover’s bed to float
in a white condom, no longer my son’s father.
Tomorrow describes everything in detail.
It explains nothing. It does not teach my boy
that tenements are better than the future,
better that peace, more likely to produce
brothers than are the glassy hands of mornings
without end or walls denuded of their wire.
In the dead zone of irony before dawn,
only the cats cry, like martyrs in the flame. 
3.
Gates everywhere. The Brandenburg. The Great
Gate of Kiev beneath which children stride
onto an invisible crescendo
disappearing into gasoline fires,
emerging as the new shapes of righteousness
in slow vans through the Brandenburg Gate.
Oaths are secret because none suspects
that they are kept. They thrust themselves towards us
unashamedly, like the insane homeless,
and we do not see them. In our loneliness,
we see a chance for love in betrayal,
not death. In our loneliness, we see the happy
triumph of glassy hands in free elections,
not the denuding of Berlin or wanderings
of children in vans reduced by fire
to black transparencies in the morning shade.
When Joan of Arc surrendered to the flames
she cried out “Jesus, Jesus.” Some years later,
a failed magician who had loved her cried out
“Joan, Joan” as the flames mocked him with a sortilege
too easy to be unreal or profitable. 
I walk for a long time and try to conjure
the form of loneliness without Cold War.
It is ash upon ash, a chiaroscuro
aloft and on the ground, completely still.
Oaths are secret because none suspects
the desperation of every object, the child
in every atom of the misused world
thrust towards us, crying out whatever
sacred name it witnessed put to death
on the ascending music of a wall.
Our buildings are tall and have no names.
The parks grow glassy hands instead of flowers. 
4.
Afterwards, the calm is piteous
but insubstantial as a smell of burn
that does not rise in smoke or dies with the fire.
Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise
and having to invent air, invent light
from nothing but untriggered memory.
All things beloved are recalled to pain.
Air recollected from the wrists of girls
braceleted for Confirmation, crossed.
Light recollected from between the cars
of night trains in a deep river valley
where islands in the river glowed like swans.
Air recollected form a ditch in flower.
Light recollected from the sex of flowers
in bare rooms, the grainy light of blondes.
Air recollected from religion.
Light recollected form the incensed clutch
of bodies before sunrise in the oaths
of a great and ignorant lost cause. 
Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise
having spent the night in bed with a stranger.
Aloft and on the ground the calm
unfurls like flags without device or slogan.
The inconsequence of the day ahead
stirs airless atmospheres in darkness
visible as daylight but without shade.
Without Cold War, without the arbitrary
demarcation of cause from cause, of light
and air from the unsexed improvisations
of memory, I cannot see to walk
or breathe to breathe. Sex becomes applause.
Sex becomes television, and the bastard
avant garde of lonely architecture
breaks ground at the unwired heart of a city
that marks the capital of nothing now. 
5.
A scratchy, recorded call to prayer crosses
the alley from one new building into mine.
The consolations of history are furtive,
then fugitive, then forgotten like a bar
of music that might have been obscene or sacred
once, in another city, in the days
before today. My son is well. He works
the public ground and needs no Antigone.
My lover sits beside him at dinner,
sharing a joke, unmapping the tall future
and its unbiased children, reinventing
the sexual pavilion to accommodate
plague wards. Romance forgives romance. 
The early isolation of this gorgeous
century disappears into good works.
The future is best. To put a final stop
to the grotesque unmercy of martyrdom
and to the ruinous armies of mad boys
whose government is rape, whose justice
is a wall, revoke all partisanship,
adjourn the Terror. The future is best.
It unobscures the dusty nudes. It protects
the river islands and their glowing swans.
But when I need to die, who will light the fire?
What names shall I cry out and what music
burn to a black transparency in my heart?
The unborn have been revoked. They will not be kind.


^^EOP^^

Spun silk of mercy,
long-limbed afternoon,
sun urging purple blossoms from baked stems.   
What better blessing than to move without hurry   
under trees?
Lugging a bucket to the rose that became a twining   
house by now, roof and walls of vine—
you could live inside this rose.
Pouring a slow stream around the
ancient pineapple crowned with spiky fruit,   
I thought we would feel old
by the year 2000.
Walt Disney thought cars would fly. 
What a drama to keep thinking the last summer   
the last birthday

A giant bird- of-paradise has climbed the bar: in this paradise  there are no flowers, no flowers at all. When Happy Hour becomes Last Call—  Adam in drag our royalty— we buy her gin for eternity  (an unseen deejay scores the years with pulsing music of the spheres).  Now the queen has gone, gone again in search of love, in search of sin.  It’s closing time. You were not at fault. I drain my glass   and lick the salt.

I saw him once before,As he passed by the door,
   And againThe pavement stones resound,As he totters o’er the ground
   With his cane.
They say that in his prime,Ere the pruning-knife of Time
   Cut him down,Not a better man was foundBy the Crier on his round
   Through the town.
But now he walks the streets,And looks at all he meets
   Sad and wan,And he shakes his feeble head,That it seems as if he said,
   “They are gone.”
The mossy marbles restOn the lips that he has prest
   In their bloom,And the names he loved to hearHave been carved for many a year
   On the tomb.
My grandmamma has said—Poor old lady, she is dead
   Long ago—That he had a Roman nose,And his cheek was like a rose
   In the snow;
But now his nose is thin,And it rests upon his chin
   Like a staff,And a crook is in his back,And a melancholy crack
   In his laugh.
I know it is a sinFor me to sit and grin
   At him here;But the old three-cornered hat,And the breeches, and all that,
   Are so queer!
And if I should live to beThe last leaf upon the tree
   In the spring,Let them smile, as I do now,At the old forsaken bough
   Where I cling.

My grandfather was always sad. Sadly, as a boy, he paddled his canoe along the beautiful Hudson River, which was only then beginning to die. During the first war he was very sad in France because he knew he was having the time of his life. When it was over everyone in American felt like a hero — imagine. 
   Once a year on Armistice Day, he met with all his friends from the war. They got drunk and recounted the stories of the time when they had thought they were men and the world had seemed entirely possible. They placed empty chairs for certain of the dead, and in the center of the table, a bottle of cognac from France, for the last man of them to drink alone, in honor of the others. 
   Year after year they gathered to watch each other and themselves disappear, turn into empty chairs. Sooner or later they were all sad. Some of them must have realized they didn’t need to join a club for this. 
   Finally it came down to my grandfather and a man named Oscar Cooper. Neither of them wanted to outlive anyone. They couldn’t remember what honor was. When they drank the cognac it didn’t taste like anything. They threw the bottle in the river as if they thought it meant that neither of them was alive anymore. 
   When Cooper died the following year, my grandfather took his rifle out into the yard and fired three shots at the sky. Then he went down to the river and drank himself to sleep. After that he was never sad, not even when the river died.

for Vivian Schatz



Here, in our familiar streets, the day
is brisk with winter’s business.
The reassuring rows of brick façades,
litter baskets overflowing
with the harvest of the streets
and, when the light turns, the people
move in unison, the cars miraculously
slide to a stop, no one is killed,
the streets, for some reason, do not
show the blood that is pouring
like a tide, on other shores. 
         Martinez, the last peasant left alive
         in his village, refuses to run, hopes
         that God, El Salvador,
         will let him get the harvest in.
         “Can a fish live out of water?” he says
         for why he stays, and weeds
         another row, ignoring the fins
         of sharks that push up
         through the furrows. 
Here, it is said, we live
in the belly of the beast. Ahab sits
forever at the helm, his skin
white wax, an effigy. The whale carries
him, lashed to its side by the ropes
from his own harpoon. His eyes
are dead. His ivory leg
juts from the flank of Leviathan
like a useless tooth. 
         One more time, the distant sail appears,
         a cloud forms, an old icon for mercy
         turned up in a dusty corner
         of the sky, preparing rain
         for the parched land, Rachel
         weeping for her children. “Can a fish
         live out of water?” he asks
         and the rain answers, in Spanish,
         manitas de plata
         little hands of silver on his brow.

No changes of support—only
Patches of gray, here where sunlight fell.
The house seems heavier
Now that they have gone away.   
In fact it emptied in record time.   
When the flat table used to result
A match recedes, slowly, into the night.
The academy of the future is   
Opening its doors and willing
The fruitless sunlight streams into domes,   
The chairs piled high with books and papers. 
The sedate one is this month’s skittish one   
Confirming the property that,
A timeless value, has changed hands.
And you could have a new automobile
Ping pong set and garage, but the thief   
Stole everything like a miracle.
In his book there was a picture of treason only   
And in the garden, cries and colors.

Saturday, April 5. Welles’s Othello:
black and white grid of rage, 
steam of sheer fury spewing from the vent
of violence that followed where they went. 
Wind howled on the battlements, but sun
gilded glum canals. The lovers floated 
beneath black bridges, coupled in stone rooms.
The unrepentant villain (at the start 
so all the rest was flashback)
dangled from a cage 
squinting inscrutably at the funeral
procession winding through the town below. 
The air was full of wailing.
Knives of sunlight glittered on the sea. 
We lurched out onto Fifty-Seventh Street.
You said “I think I’m dying.” 
Next week your eyes went out.
Shining under the lamp, 
your blue gaze, now opaque,
your face drawn sharper but still beautiful: 
from this extremity you can attempt
to rise to rage and grief. Or you can yield 
to the cozy quicksand of the bed.
You wave your hand at walls of books: 
“What do I do? Do I throw all these away?”
Their anecdotes, their comforts—now black glass.

Extravagant sweep
                         of clear sky
                                           darkening
in the big picture window
                                     beside the bed,
lights here and there
                               already flashing all
across the city down below us—
                                              Ellen
and the girls out somewhere,
                                          you and I alone,
you with your eyes closed,
                                       I with a drink in hand:
you suddenly in character,
                                        your voice
a wraith’s voice,
                         faint, stumbling,
                                                   slurry
with morphine,
                     and yet
                               still artful
                                                 as ever,
even if the art
                      was obvious,
the dying brother
                      playing the dying brother— Do you think
                  you have a problem
                                             with that?

I am afraid after reading all these so-called initiation books that some
cortege of boot lickers will enter my room while I am sleeping and suck
my eyes out with soda straws they will be older men and women much like
the amanuenses with bad breath in the principal’s office who call
up and tell on you the Unferths of the world better beware
I know Jesus would have kicked your teeth in you couldn’t pull that shit on him
he was telling his buddies one night boys I’m glad y’all decided to come on up
and eat supper with me I hadn’t got much there’s a few things I’d like to say
at this time Matthew says to Simon I sure as hell don’t know what he’s got us
here this time for I’m beginning to wonder you talked to him lately
yea I was shooting the shit with him on the mountain but I want to tell you
this Matthew don’t never come up on him when he’s alone he jumped on me
I thought he was going to kill me he was just walking around just talking
to himself waving his arms like he does he’s worse than John   
Jude put his hand up to his mouth and said down the table I think Jesus is going
off his rocker get Simon to tell you what he asked me
Simon says he didn’t want to talk about politics or dreams or nothing he just said
Jude next time y’all are over in Mesopotamia why don’t you pick me up a few   
bottles of that wine they make over there
sure thing Jesus I says
well now the boss is talking he is saying I asked y’all up here because frankly
I’ve been feeling a little sick lately and I want to make sure y’all know what
to do in case anything happens I know one of you is going to do me in I know
that but goddamnit y’all know those people in town are after my ass
the other night I walked down the streets in a disguise and I seen a couple
of you messing around and drinking with the soldiers what’s going to happen
if one of you gets drunk and lets it slip where I’m hiding out then I’ll
be in a fix you know if they was to find me they going to cut me y’all ever
think about that and Peter ain’t you ever going to get it straight what you’re
supposed to do give me one of those biscuits Judas and go outside and take a   
look-see I got you Jesus Judas says
John leans over he says been catching any fish Peter
oh well I been getting a few of a morning they ain’t biting too good now you know
on account of this blamed weather nobody is even listening to Jesus he’s just
talking to himself like he was crazy Matthew says I believe he’s been hitting
that wine a little too hard don’t you reckon
Jesus says another thing I told all of you it’d be better if you didn’t get
involved with women
now just listen to that little two-faced bastard James the Lesser says
we all know what he’s up to shacking up with all those town girls
the other night he was dressed fit to kill and drunk as six hundred dollars
a rolling around in the mud like a hog kissing that whore’s foot why shit
I wish he’d let us in on what he really does
Thomas spoke up for once he says I know what you mean the other day Andrew
and I asked him about some scripture he said leave me alone I don’t know
nothing about that shit and then we seen him cussing out a priest over at the   
temple he knew more about it than the elder did
another thing Matthew says I wish he’d start writing what he wants done down
and do it so I can read it you know as well as I do that damned Peter can’t
keep it straight he won’t get anything right
Bartholomew says don’t make no difference atoll cause Paul is going to tell
it like he wants to that’s for damned sure
all the time Jesus just mumbling to himself wine spilt all over his robe
the rest of them chattering and cussing trying to figure him out
John the Baptist about the only one Jesus can count on except for crazy John   
is banging his goblet on the table he is saying now ain’t this a sight
spitting in the lord’s face at his own birthday party I’ll swan
Brother John why don’t you tell Jesus what the real problem is
the crazy one says everyone of y’all is chickenshits you are afraid to look
those elders in the eye and tell them what you think ya’ll get up on a rock
to talk and you see a soldier coming and you say anybody seen a stray mule
Jesus is saying to himself I’m going to pull those temples down if I have to
get me a rope and tie it to a pillar and a jackass and do it myself
wake up Jesus Philip says
Paul who hadn’t touched a drop gets up and gets his paper out and says
the nature of the problem Jesus is this the people don’t believe you
those fellows in the temples have got it all organized all they have to do
is send out stooges and hire a couple of rednecks who make out like they’re
crippled they have a big gathering they say the same things you say they   
pull off a fake healing the redneck’s wife stands up she says LIE he ain’t lame
he’s just drunk and so all the people go home saying those christians what a   
bunch of wind see Jesus they are using your material but they ain’t coming
through so that is making you an enemy of the people we just got to get
organized as is proved here today by your followers carrying on as they did
so I’m getting sold down the river by the elders and their hirelings uh
that’s right Jesus ask anybody here why I didn’t think they’d do that he says
I told you a long time ago not to keep talking with them temple people John says
you should a know’d what they was up to ain’t nobody going to understand you
why you ought to know that when we first run on to you we had second thoughts
we thought you was crazy there’s probably still some sitting down here right   
this second that still thinks you are a crazy one but Jesus you should a known
we been through a lot together we go a long way back you should a listened
all they wanted was you they liable to get you yet then they won’t have no
competition they want to keep feeding the hogs the same slop
they the ones that want to get fat man you listening to me Jesus
he says ok if that’s the way they want to do things at the temple
I’m going to change my tactics I going out after these chillun more than I have
been they’ll know I’m telling the truth I still got a few things up my sleeve
left what’s that Paul says
I’m going to do a few things can’t nobody follow
we could always go back to biting the heads off fish and chickens Peter says
why don’t you let us in on it for a change Paul says we follow you around
like we were a bunch of sheep picking up your tab bailing you out of jail
coming up here all the time for supper and what do we get to eat nothing
why can’t you have a little faith in us Jesus
ok this is what we going to do he says hold on who is that walking up the steps
it’s just Judas
how does it go boy Jesus says and the other one answers just fine Jesus just fine
and John the Baptist turns around he says to the one who has just slipped in boy
didn’t I see you talking to some white folks the other day
here endeth with a chord on the guitar that’s how the men did Jesus like he was
old like he was young just like Elvis did to Big Dad Arthur I know
just like another blind singer the men come down to see with their equipment
they get his song they pay him twenty dollars and he don’t hear from them ever
again except sometimes in the mail on Christmas when one of them might send a   
five dollar check there won’t nobody cash oh tell me brother how do the old men
feel who were young as purple flowers from Hawaii once when they listen to their
songs coming in over a borrowed radio tell me don’t they take up a notch in they belt
don't they tie another knot in they headband don't they wring that sweat out
have mercy Jesus deliver me from the lawyers and the teachers and the preachers
and the politicking flies can’t you hear them buzz can’t you hear them bite another
chunk out of me oh brother I am death and you are sleep I am white and you are
black brother tell me I am that which I am I am sleep and you are death we are
one person getting up and going outside naked as a blue jay rolling our bellies
at the moon oh brother tell me you love me and I’ll tell you too I want to know
how do they like it when the ones who sung shake they leg on the Television
I want to know Jesus don’t a blind man count no more some by signs others by
whispers some with a kiss and some with a gun and some with a six bit fountain
pen whoa lord help me and my brother help us get through this tookover land

(or a self / sung eulogy)



Now, when I / die, dont you bury me
On no lone prairie;
And dont put me in no plain pine box
(cause I left plenty cold cash!);
And throw my cold butt in the deep blue see.
Whatever you do, dont plant me / in no six feet of dirt;
Just mash me, mash me, except for my dick,
Which I want wrapped in a white / woman’s skirt. 
I dont want no preacher / man a-preaching
Over me—cause I know where I am going.
I dont want no tears, no flowers,
No standing around and waiting / up / all hours.
Just get a golden trumpet, and have Dizzy blow it.
Cause I / wuz / Slick—and you damn well know it. 
No piano playing, no blues please;
No moaning and groaning;
Just lay me on the table, mash me
Into my two-hundred-dollar suit,
Red socks, black patent leather shoes,
Polka-dot tie (make damn sure it’s silk—
And dont forget it!) 
Take me out to my pink cadillac
Prop me up / under the steering wheel,
Tow me out to real high hill,
Dig a hole—twenty feet long and twenty feet wide,
Place a giant joint of reefer / weed by my side;
Then leave me alone—
And let me drive to hell in style!

My wife tells me she hears a beetle
Scurrying across the kitchen floor.
She says our daughter is dreaming 
Too loudly, just listen, her eyelids
Are fluttering like butterflies. 
What about the thunder, I say,
What about the dispatches from the police car
Parked outside, or me rolling over like a whale? 
She tells me there’s a leaf falling
And grazing the downstairs window,
Or it could be glass cutters, diamonds,
Thieves working their hands toward the latch.
She tells me our son is breathing too quickly,
Is it pneumonia, is it the furnace
Suddenly pumping monoxides through the house? 
So when my wife says sleep, she means
A closing of the eyes, a tuning
Of the ears to ultra frequencies. 
(It is what always happens
When there are children, the bed
Becoming at night a listening post,
Each little ting forewarning disaster.) 
Downstairs there is the sound
Of something brushing against something else
And I try to listen as my wife might listen,
Insects, I say, dust on a table top,
Maybe a knife’s edge against the palm. 
But she tells me it’s only
The African violet on the windowsill
Putting out another flower,
And falls luxuriously into a dream
Of being awake and vigilant. 
So the house grows noisier,
There are clicks in the woodwork,
There are drips, raps, clunks, things
To make sense of, make benign. 
My son and daughter are sleeping calmly,
And the stairs, yes, are creaking,
The wind, I think, or maybe two men,
Where’s the beaker of acid,
The bowling ball, the war hoop
I learned in second grade? 
So this is what it’s like when there’s
No one left but you to love and defend. 
Outside there are cats in a fight
And they remind me too much of babies crying.
Then the bottle thrown against the stoop,
The sound of something delicate shattered. 
My wife stirs, Be glad, she says,
Sound doesn’t carry far, that you don’t hear
The whole of it, cries in the night,
Children in other cities, hurts, silences. 
And she’s right, I can’t hear the whole of it,
Or else I hear too much and it’s noise
Or I make it noise because it’s too much. 
So I begin homing in on something
Around me, something distinct, my wife’s
Breathing, a window’s rattle. Outside,
Grass is lengthening in the dark,
And sap running up the phloem of the maple,
(Do I hear it? And how the stars must be wheeling!)
And in the far room, my children’s
Hearts are keeping time, for them, for us
Who have begun to listen in earnest.

Snow melts into the earth and a gentle breeze   
Loosens the damp gum wrappers, the stale leaves   
Left over from autumn, and the dead brown grass.   
The sky shakes itself out. And the invisible birds   
Winter put away somewhere return, the air relaxes,   
People start to circulate again in twos and threes.   
The dominant feelings are the blue sky, and the year.   
—Memories of other seasons and the billowing wind;   
The light gradually altering from difficult to clear
As a page melts and a photograph develops in the backyard.   
When some men came to tear down the garage across the way   
The light was still clear, but the salt intoxication   
Was already dissipating into the atmosphere of constant day   
April brings, between the isolation and the flowers.   
Now the clouds are lighter, the branches are frosted green,   
And suddenly the season that had seemed so tentative before   
Becomes immediate, so clear the heart breaks and the vibrant   
Air is laced with crystal wires leading back from hell.   
Only the distraction, and the exaggerated sense of care   
Here at the heart of spring—all year long these feelings
Alternately wither and bloom, while a dense abstraction   
Hides them. But now the mental dance of solitude resumes,   
And life seems smaller, placed against the background   
Of this story with the empty, moral quality of an expansive   
Gesture made up out of trees and clouds and air. 
The loneliness comes and goes, but the blue holds,   
Permeating the early leaves that flutter in the sunlight   
As the air dances up and down the street. Some kids yell.   
A white dog rolls over on the grass and barks once. And   
Although the incidents vary and the principal figures change,   
Once established, the essential tone and character of a season   
Stays inwardly the same day after day, like a person’s.   
The clouds are frantic. Shadows sweep across the lawn   
And up the side of the house. A dappled sky, a mild blue   
Watercolor light that floats the tense particulars away   
As the distraction starts. Spring here is at first so wary,   
And then so spare that even the birds act like strangers,   
Trying out the strange air with a hesitant chirp or two,   
And then subsiding. But the season intensifies by degrees,   
Imperceptibly, while the colors deepen out of memory,   
The flowers bloom and the thick leaves gleam in the sunlight   
Of another city, in a past which has almost faded into heaven.   
And even though memory always gives back so much more of   
What was there than the mind initially thought it could hold,   
Where will the separation and the ache between the isolated   
Moments go when summer comes and turns this all into a garden?   
Spring here is too subdued: the air is clear with anticipation,   
But its real strength lies in the quiet tension of isolation   
And living patiently, without atonement or regret,
In the eternity of the plain moments, the nest of care   
—Until suddenly, all alone, the mind is lifted upward into   
Light and air and the nothingness of the sky,   
Held there in that vacant, circumstantial blue until,
In the vehemence of a landscape where all the colors disappear,   
The quiet absolution of the spirit quickens into fact,   
And then, into death. But the wind is cool.   
The buds are starting to open on the trees.
Somewhere up in the sky an airplane drones.

The laws of science teach us a pound of gold weighs as   
much as a pound of flour though if dropped from any   
undetermined height in their natural state one would
reach bottom and one would fly away 
Laws of motion tell us an inert object is more difficult to   
propel than an object heading in the wrong direction is to   
turn around. Motion being energy—inertia—apathy.   
Apathy equals hostility. Hostility—violence. Violence   
being energy is its own virtue. Laws of motion teach us 
Black people are no less confused because of our   
Blackness than we are diffused because of our
powerlessness. Man we are told is the only animal who   
smiles with his lips. The eyes however are the mirror of
the soul 
The problem with love is not what we feel but what we   
wish we felt when we began to feel we should feel
something. Just as publicity is not production: seduction
is not seductive 
If I could make a wish I’d wish for all the knowledge of all   
the world. Black may be beautiful Professor Micheau
says but knowledge is power. Any desirable object is
bought and sold—any neglected object declines in value.   
It is against man’s nature to be in either category 
If white defines Black and good defines evil then men
define women or women scientifically speaking describe
men. If sweet is the opposite of sour and heat the
absence of cold then love is the contradiction of pain and
beauty is in the eye of the beheld 
Sometimes I want to touch you and be touched in   
return. But you think I’m grabbing and I think you’re   
shirking and Mama always said to look out for men like   
you 
So I go to the streets with my lips painted red and my   
eyes carefully shielded to seduce the world my reluctant   
lover 
And you go to your men slapping fives feeling good   
posing as a man because you know as long as you sit   
very very still the laws of motion will be in effect

The renewal project is doomed: because
its funding board’s vice-president resigned: because
the acids of divorce were eating day-long
at her stomach, at her thoughts: because
her husband was neglecting her, in favor of his daughter,
who was dying: because her husband,
bi and edgy, bore an AIDS sore that was ripe
enough with fear and woe to throw this whole
thick network of connections off its balance
and down a hole of human misery. Haven’t we seen it happen?
—when a crowded room at a party was tilted
perilously askew by the weight of two
wept tears that weren’t as large as a housefly’s wings,
that couldn’t have filled a pistachio shell.

It’s like this: because because because,
Sawyer was drunk when he delivered his opening remarks
onstage at Stardome Planetarium. He
stood below a slide show of “The Emptiness of Outer Space”
—stars and planets, scattered like the scantest
motes of dust in unimaginable void—and was about
to make the leap to what percent of us,
our dearly thumping bodies, is a corresponding emptiness . . .
when one foot met a wire that had strayed
outside the curtain, and a wild arc of hand undid
the podium, which canted off its casters sidelong
into the 3-D galaxy props, and you could say whatever
thimble or pustule or hackle of grief was his,
it had toppled the whole damn universe. 
_________  
Was she a ghost? Sometimes she thought she was
a ghost, transparent, stealing through the lives of people
untouched and untouching. And so she carried a bucket
of burning coals (we’ll call it that for now) against
her breasts; and then she knew she was alive. And
he. . . ?—was just the rusty foxing that an antique book
exhales into dim air, wasn’t that what he was,
oh it was, yes it was, and so one afternoon he strapped
a meteorite to his back, and now he walks the streets
like anybody else. An ageless tribal saying: If you aren’t given a burden, you must carve your own. 
An eye will do, if it’s ill. One word, if it’s cruel.
And don’t be fooled by breath: the throat holds up
some old-time blues the way a hod holds bricks. 
_________  
But she didn’t die of full-blown AIDS
—Sawyer’s daughter. Even so, her twisted legs and limp
are enough to sometimes send him a little
over the blotto line. Tonight, though, after show time,
he’s just soused enough to wander through the mock-up
stage-set milky ways agog with child-wonder:
all those luminescent islands! all that vacuum!
Look: a planet floats, there’s that much cosmos
all around it. A planet! While we . . . we couldn’t
squint and levitate a half inch, not the guru-most
among us. Well, we could: if the laws of the universe changed.
It’s only the Earth that makes us so heavy.
It’s only our lives that keep our lives
from floating off into the nothing.

His eye was wild and his face was taut with anger and hate and rage,And the things he muttered were much too strong for the ink of the printed page.I found him there when the dusk came down, in his golf clothes still was he,And his clubs were strewn around his feet as he told his grief to me:“I’d an easy five for a seventy-nine—in sight of the golden goal—An easy five and I took an eight—an eight on the eighteenth hole!
“I’ve dreamed my dreams of the ‘seventy men,’ and I’ve worked year after year,I have vowed I would stand with the chosen few ere the end of my golf career;I’ve cherished the thought of a seventy score, and the days have come and goneAnd I’ve never been close to the golden goal my heart was set upon.But today I stood on the eighteenth tee and counted that score of mine,And my pulses raced with the thrill of joy—I’d a five for seventy-nine!
“I can kick the ball from the eighteenth tee and get this hole in five,Bit I took the wood and I tried to cross that ditch with a mighty drive—”Let us end the quotes, it is best for all to imagine his language rich,But he topped that ball, as we often do, and the pill stopped in the ditch.His third was short and his fourth was bad and his fifth was off the line,And he took an eight on the eighteenth hole with a five for a seventy-nine.
I gathered his clubs and I took his arm and alone in the locker roomI left him sitting upon the bench, a picture of grief and gloom;And the last man came and took his shower and hurried upon his way,But still he sat with his head bowed down like one with a mind astray,And he counted his score card o’er and o’er and muttered this doleful whine:“I took an eight on the eighteenth hole, with a five for a seventy-nine!”

It’s up and away from our work to-day,     For the breeze sweeps over the down; And it’s hey for a game where the gorse blossoms flame,     And the bracken is bronzing to brown. With the turf ’neath our tread and the blue overhead,     And the song of the lark in the whin; There’s the flag and the green, with the bunkers between—     Now will you be over or in?  The doctor may come, and we’ll teach him to know     A tee where no tannin can lurk; The soldier may come, and we’ll promise to show     Some hazards a soldier may shirk; The statesman may joke, as he tops every stroke,     That at last he is high in his aims; And the clubman will stand with a club in his hand     That is worth every club in St. James’.  The palm and the leather come rarely together,     Gripping the driver’s haft, And it’s good to feel the jar of the steel     And the spring of the hickory shaft. Why trouble or seek for the praise of a clique?     A cleek here is common to all; And the lie that might sting is a very small thing     When compared with the lie of the ball.  Come youth and come age, from the study or stage,     From Bar or from Bench—high and low! A green you must use as a cure for the blues—     You drive them away as you go. We’re outward bound on a long, long round,     And it’s time to be up and away: If worry and sorrow come back with the morrow,     At least we’ll be happy to-day.

Wanting is reposed and plump   
As the hands of a Romanov child 
Folded in the doeskin sashes of her lap,   
Paused before the little war begins. 
            This one will be guttural, this war.   
How is it possible to still be startled 
As I am by the oblong silhouette of the coiling   
Index finger of a pending death. 
No longer will
                        Wooing be the wondrous 
Thing; instead, a homely domesticity, constant   
As a field of early rye and yarrow-light. 
What one is fit to stand is not what one is   
Given, necessarily, and not this night.

A Story of Holland



The good dame looked from her cottage       At the close of the pleasant day, And cheerily called to her little son       Outside the door at play: “Come, Peter, come! I want you to go,       While there is light to see, To the hut of the blind old man who lives       Across the dike, for me; And take these cakes I made for him—       They are hot and smoking yet; You have time enough to go and come       Before the sun is set.”  Then the good-wife turned to her labor,       Humming a simple song, And thought of her husband, working hard       At the sluices all day long; And set the turf a-blazing,       And brought the coarse black bread; That he might find a fire at night,       And find the table spread.  And Peter left the brother,       With whom all day he had played, And the sister who had watched their sports       In the willow’s tender shade; And told them they ’d see him back before       They saw a star in sight, Though he would n’t be afraid to go       In the very darkest night! For he was a brave, bright fellow,       With eye and conscience clear; He could do whatever a boy might do,       And he had not learned to fear. Why, he would n’t have robbed a bird’s nest,       Nor brought a stork to harm, Though never a law in Holland       Had stood to stay his arm!  And now, with his face all glowing,       And eyes as bright as the day With the thoughts of his pleasant errand,       He trudged along the way; And soon his joyous prattle       Made glad a lonesome place— Alas! if only the blind old man       Could have seen that happy face! Yet he somehow caught the brightness       Which his voice and presence lent; And he felt the sunshine come and go       As Peter came and went.  And now, as the day was sinking,       And the winds began to rise, The mother looked from her door again,       Shading her anxious eyes; And saw the shadows deepen       And birds to their homes come back, But never a sign of Peter       Along the level track. But she said: “He will come at morning,       So I need not fret or grieve— Though it is n’t like my boy at all       To stay without my leave.”  But where was the child delaying?       On the homeward way was he, And across the dike while the sun was up       An hour above the sea. He was stopping now to gather flowers,       Now listening to the sound, As the angry waters dashed themselves       Against their narrow bound. “Ah! well for us,” said Peter,       “That the gates are good and strong, And my father tends them carefully,       Or they would not hold you long! You ’re a wicked sea,” said Peter;       “I know why you fret and chafe; You would like to spoil our lands and homes;       But our sluices keep you safe!”  But hark! Through the noise of waters       Comes a low, clear, trickling sound; And the child’s face pales with terror,       And his blossoms drop to the ground. He is up the bank in a moment,       And, stealing through the sand, He sees a stream not yet so large       As his slender, childish hand. ’T is a leak in the dike! He is but a boy,       Unused to fearful scenes; But, young as he is, he has learned to know       The dreadful thing that means. A leak in the dike! The stoutest heart       Grows faint that cry to hear, And the bravest man in all the land       Turns white with mortal fear. For he knows the smallest leak may grow       To a flood in a single night; And he knows the strength of the cruel sea       When loosed in its angry might.  And the boy! He has seen the danger,       And, shouting a wild alarm, He forces back the weight of the sea       With the strength of his single arm! He listens for the joyful sound       Of a footstep passing nigh; And lays his ear to the ground, to catch       The answer to his cry. And he hears the rough winds blowing,       And the waters rise and fall, But never an answer comes to him,       Save the echo of his call. He sees no hope, no succor,       His feeble voice is lost; Yet what shall he do but watch and wait,       Though he perish at his post!  So, faintly calling and crying       Till the sun is under the sea; Crying and moaning till the stars       Come out for company; He thinks of his brother and sister,       Asleep in their safe warm bed; He thinks of his father and mother,       Of himself as dying—and dead; And of how, when the night is over,       They must come and find him at last: But he never thinks he can leave the place       Where duty holds him fast.  The good dame in the cottage       Is up and astir with the light, For the thought of her little Peter       Has been with her all night. And now she watches the pathway,       As yester eve she had done; But what does she see so strange and black       Against the rising sun? Her neighbors are bearing between them       Something straight to her door; Her child is coming home, but not       As he ever came before!  “He is dead!” she cries; “my darling!”       And the startled father hears, And comes and looks the way she looks,       And fears the thing she fears: Till a glad shout from the bearers       Thrills the stricken man and wife— “Give thanks, for your son has saved our land,       And God has saved his life!” So, there in the morning sunshine       They knelt about the boy; And every head was bared and bent       In tearful, reverent joy.  ’T is many a year since then; but still,       When the sea roars like a flood, Their boys are taught what a boy can do       Who is brave and true and good. For every man in that country       Takes his son by the hand, And tells him of little Peter,       Whose courage saved the land.  They have many a valiant hero,       Remembered through the years: But never one whose name so oft       Is named with loving tears. And his deed shall be sung by the cradle,       And told to the child on the knee, So long as the dikes of Holland       Divide the land from the sea!

“The experience of truth is indispensible
for the experience of beauty and the sense
of beauty is guided by a leap in the dark.”
Arthur Koestler



I. 
Stoplights edged the licorice street with ribbon,
neon embroidering wet sidewalks. She turned 
into the driveway and leaped in the dark. A blackbird
perched on the bouncing twig of a maple, heard 
her whisper, “Stranger, lover, the lost days are over.
While I walk from car to door, something inward opens 
like four o’clocks in rain. Earth, cold from autumn,
pulls me. I can’t breathe the same 
with dirt for marrow and mist for skin,
blurring my vision, my vision’s separate self. 
I stand drunk in this glitter, under the sky’s grey shelter.
The city maple, not half so bitter, hurls itself 
in two directions, until both tips darken and disappear,
as I darken my reflection in the smoking mirror 
of my home. How faint the sound of dry leaves,
like the clattering keys of another morning, another world.” 
                                       II. 
She looked out the window at some inward greying door.
The maple held her glance, made ground fog from her cigarette. 
Beyond uneven stairs, children screamed,
gunned each other down. Then she sealed her nimble dreams 
with water from a murky bay. “For him I map
this galaxy of dust that turns without an answer. 
When it rains, I remember his face in the corridor
of a past apartment and trace the anguish around his mouth, 
his wrinkled forehead, unguarded eyes, the foreign fruit
of an intricate sadness. With the grace that remains, 
I catch a glint around a door I cannot enter.
The clock echoes in dishtowels; I search love’s center 
and bang pans against the rubble of my day, the lucid
grandeur of wet ground, the strangeness of a fatal sun 
that makes us mark on the margin of our loss,
trust in the gossamer of touch, trust in the late-plowed field.” 
                                       III. 
When the sun opened clouds and walked into her mongrel soul,
she chopped celery into rocky remnants of the sea, 
and heard fat sing up bread, a better dying.
The magnet in each seed of the green pepper kept her flying, 
floating toward memories that throb like clustered stars:
the dark water laughter of ducks, a tangle of November oaks, 
toward sudden music on a wheel of brilliant dust
where like a moon she must leap back and forth 
from emptiness. “I remember the moon shimmering
loss and discovery along a water edge, and skirting 
a slice of carrot, I welcome eternity in that sad eye of autumn.
Rare and real, I dance while vegetables sing in pairs. 
I hug my death, my chorus of years, and search
and stretch and leap, for I will be apprentice to the blood 
in spite of the mood of a world
that keeps rusting, rusting the wild throats of birds.” 
                                       IV. 
In lamplight she saw the smoke of another’s dream:
her daughter walk woods where snow weighs down pine, 
her son cry on a bridge that ends in deep-rooted dark,
her man, stalled on a lonely road, realize his torque 
was alcohol and hatred. “Hungry for silence, I listen
to wind, to the sound of water running down mountain, 
my own raw breath. Between the sounds, a seaborn god
plays his reed in the caverns of my being. 
I wear his amethyst, let go my dreams: Millars, Lacewings,
and Junebugs scatter, widen and batter the dark, 
brightening this loud dust with the fever of their eyes.
Oh crazy itch that grabs us beyond loss 
and lets us forgive, so that we can answer birds and deer,
lightning and rain, shadow and hurricane. 
Truth waits in the creek, cutting the winter brown hills.
It sings with needles of ice, sings because of its scar.”

On Magnolia Avenue there are no magnolias. Someone bought
the house of the one survivor. All morning I heard the chainsaw
sever its limbs from root to bud. No more scattered flowers, star city.
No pink galaxy. Now the yard is a parking space, one Jeep SUV,
one older car. Next door a woman comes out, late afternoon,
a child in her arms. She speaks low, as if there’s just the two of them.
She says to him, Listen to the little birdies, and he listens to
the common sparrows talking in the hedge. He listens as they argue
back and forth, their dialect of nature, as the street clatters with commuters
taking a shortcut home. She says: Listen. And he turns his head to follow
the fugitive motion, the small streaked wings unfolding, folding,
the relentless chirp from a tiny blunt beak, the sound almost within reach.


^^EOP^^

Leave him now quiet by the way To rest apart. I know what draws him to the dust alway And churns him in the builder’s lime: He has the fright of time.  I heard it knocking in his breast A minute since; His human eyes did wince, He stubborned like the massive slaughter beast And as a thing o’erwhelmed with sound Stood bolted to the ground.  Leave him, for rest alone can cure— If cure there be— This waif upon the sea. He is of those who slanted the great door And listened—wretched little lad— To what they said.


^^EOP^^

I do not know where either of us can turn Just at first, waking from the sleep of each other. I do not know how we can bear The river struck by the gold plummet of the moon, Or many trees shaken together in the darkness. We shall wish not to be alone And that love were not dispersed and set free— Though you defeat me, And I be heavy upon you.  But like earth heaped over the heart Is love grown perfect. Like a shell over the beat of life Is love perfect to the last. So let it be the same Whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another; Let us know this for leavetaking, That I may not be heavy upon you, That you may blind me no more.

Where the slow river   
meets the tide,
a red swan lifts red wings
and darker beak,
and underneath the purple down
of his soft breast
uncurls his coral feet. 
Through the deep purple
of the dying heat
of sun and mist,
the level ray of sun-beam
has caressed
the lily with dark breast,
and flecked with richer gold
its golden crest. 
Where the slow lifting   
of the tide,   
floats into the river   
and slowly drifts   
among the reeds,   
and lifts the yellow flags,   
he floats   
where tide and river meet.    
Ah kingly kiss—
no more regret   
nor old deep memories   
to mar the bliss;   
where the low sedge is thick,   
the gold day-lily   
outspreads and rests   
beneath soft fluttering   
of red swan wings
and the warm quivering
of the red swan's breast.

her grandmother called her from the playground   
       “yes, ma’am”
       “i want chu to learn how to make rolls” said the old   
woman proudly
but the little girl didn’t want
to learn how because she knew
even if she couldn’t say it that
that would mean when the old one died she would be less   
dependent on her spirit so
she said
       “i don’t want to know how to make no rolls”
with her lips poked out

and neither of them ever

(For Blues People)



In the south, sleeping against
the drugstore, growling under   
the trucks and stoves, stumbling   
through and over the cluttered eyes   
of early mysterious night. Frowning   
drunk waving moving a hand or lash.   
Dancing kneeling reaching out, letting   
a hand rest in shadows. Squatting   
to drink or pee. Stretching to climb   
pulling themselves onto horses near   
where there was sea (the old songs   
lead you to believe). Riding out   
from this town, to another, where   
it is also black. Down a road
where people are asleep. Towards   
the moon or the shadows of houses.   
Towards the songs’ pretended sea.

In Chicago, it is snowing softly
and a man has just done his wash for the week.   
He steps into the twilight of early evening,   
carrying a wrinkled shopping bag   
full of neatly folded clothes,
and, for a moment, enjoys
the feel of warm laundry and crinkled paper,
flannellike against his gloveless hands.   
There’s a Rembrandt glow on his face,
a triangle of orange in the hollow of his cheek   
as a last flash of sunset
blazes the storefronts and lit windows of the street. 
He is Asian, Thai or Vietnamese,
and very skinny, dressed as one of the poor   
in rumpled suit pants and a plaid mackinaw,   
dingy and too large.
He negotiates the slick of ice
on the sidewalk by his car,
opens the Fairlane’s back door,
leans to place the laundry in,
and turns, for an instant,
toward the flurry of footsteps
and cries of pedestrians
as a boy—that’s all he was—
backs from the corner package store
shooting a pistol, firing it,
once, at the dumbfounded man
who falls forward,
grabbing at his chest. 
A few sounds escape from his mouth,   
a babbling no one understands
as people surround him
bewildered at his speech.
The noises he makes are nothing to them.   
The boy has gone, lost
in the light array of foot traffic
dappling the snow with fresh prints.
Tonight, I read about Descartes’
grand courage to doubt everything
except his own miraculous existence
and I feel so distinct
from the wounded man lying on the concrete   
I am ashamed. 
Let the night sky cover him as he dies.
Let the weaver girl cross the bridge of heaven   
and take up his cold hands.

At three p.m.
under sky coming to harm
something too red flashes from a limb, 
so red it hurts:
against sky coming apart,
against a left-out, twice-soaked shirt, 
a cardinal
inflames the profane cathedral
of suburban yard its owner let fall 
into disgrace.
How rain embarrasses
the half-pruned hedge. The half-mown grass 
that sports a tonsure
in reverse shines under the torture.
Rain slicks with praise red shed, red feather. 
Crested seedeater
out of character where
you’re neither the strictly monkish brown thrasher 
nor the odd hermit thrush,
you scratch in the underbrush
of faith to see what you can flush: 
a grub. A seed. Eminence not grise
but rouge, from your lipsticked beak 
you pass a sowbug
to your mate. You peck at a slug
sliming your path, seeming to beg 
your forgiveness.
To what would you confess
beyond season-to-season unfaithfulness?  
VESPERS 
There are more divine hours:
a gold-leafed page a mower
rows with a scythe as tall as the tower 
that tents aloft
a tiny sky bereft
of cloud, a chapel ceiling left 
unstarred, heaven
a lake turned upside down,
filled with an emptiness that’s clean 
because it’s cold,
glacial enough to scald
the skin it bathed, the lungs it filled. 
On devotion’s last page,
deep in the golden age
of illumination, the hunt’s cortège 
has halted at the edge
of the known world, a clearing wedged
in a forest of spears. Red bird the badge 
on the huntsman’s tunic,
you’re the splash of crimson lake,
the distant lordship’s flag, the cleric 
dog’s bright collar,
its heretic tongue. It slavers
on the bleeding stag. Snarling at prayer 
that chases belief,
it licks the offal of grief,
the heart cast aside reward enough.

You must laugh at yourself, laugh and laugh.
Music swells the emotions;
music exists to punctuate seeing.
Emotion, therefore, is punctuation. 
Formless, freedom resembles abasement.
Abasement is as infinite as desire.
You must laugh at yourself, laugh and laugh. 
Those who are not demons are saints.
You are not a demon or a saint. 
Women are small and want something,
so laugh at yourself, laugh and laugh. 
Bed are sites of abasement.
The news is about the news. 
Faces in close-up are always in anguish.
Hair and teeth are clues to class. 
Clothes are changing,
hanging up or down
And change itself is a laugh. 
Cause can’t be figured
and consequence is yet to come. 
You’re either awake or asleep
and that, too, is a clue to class. 
Children are never with groups of children
unless they are singing in chorus. 
Their mothers cannot do enough,
though there’s always room for improvement. 
And improvement lies in progress,
though collapsing is good for a laugh. 
Saints will turn to the worse.
Demons die if they can be found. 
Nature is combat, weather is sublime.
Even weather can make you laugh. 
People you don’t know are louder than you are,
but what is far away cannot harm you— 
Books are objects, families are inspiring.
Animals protect their young;
the young come with the territory. 
English is the only language.
Reading is an occasion for interruption,
and interruption is a kind of laugh. 
Something is bound to get better.
And there is a pill with your name on it. 
When indoors, stick with your own race—
that way you’ll feel free to laugh. 
Strangers are paying attention to your smell.
A camera will light like a moth on disaster.
Pity will turn to irony. 
The street is a dark and frightful place.
Fires are daily. 
Your car is your face. 
You must laugh at yourself, laugh and laugh.

Let me tell you about my marvelous god, how he hides in the hexagons
of the bees, how the drought that wrings its leather hands
above the world is of his making, as well as the rain in the quiet minutes
that leave only thoughts of rain.
An atom is working and working, an atom is working in deepest
night, then bursting like the farthest star; it is far
smaller than a pinprick, far smaller than a zero and it has no
will, no will toward us.
This is why the heart has paced and paced,
will pace and pace across the field where yarrow
was and now is dust. A leaf catches
in a bone. The burrow’s shut by a tumbled clod
and the roots, upturned, are hot to the touch.
How my god is a feathered and whirling thing; you will singe your arm
when you pluck him from the air,
when you pluck him from that sky
where grieving swirls, and you will burn again
throwing him back.

There was a message. I have forgotten it.
There was a journey to make. It did not come to anything.
But these nights, my friend, under the iron roof
Of this old rabbiters' hut where the traps
Are still hanging up on nails,
Lying in a dry bunk, I feel strangely at ease.
The true dreams, those longed-for strangers,
Begin to come to me through the gates of horn. 
I will not explain them. But the city, all that other life
In which we crept sadly like animals
Through thickets of dark thorns, haunted by the moisture of women,
And the rock of barren friendship, has now another shape.
Yes, I thank you. I saw you rise like a Triton,
A great reddish gourd of flesh,
From the sofa at that last party, while your mistress smiled
That perfect smile, and shout as if drowning—
'You are always—'
Despair is the only gift;
When it is shared, it becomes a different thing; like rock, like water;
And so you also can share this emptiness with me. 
Tears from faces of stone. They are our own tears.
Even if I had forgotten them
The mountain that has taken my being to itself
Would still hang over this hut, with the dead and the living
Twined in its crevasses. My door has forgotten how to shut.

My chilled limbs now nummed lye forlorn; Return, return sweet  Sol from Capricorn; In this dead time, alas, what can I more Then view those fruits which through thy heat I bore? Which sweet contentment yield me for a space, True living Pictures of their Fathers face. O strange effect! now thou art Southward gone, I weary grow, the tedious day so long; But when thou Northward to me shalt return, I wish my Sun may never set, but burn Within the Cancer of my glowing breast, The welcome house of him my dearest guest.

Dear Sirs: 
I have been enjoying the law and order of our
community throughout the past three months since
my wife and I, our two cats, and miscellaneous
photographs of the six grandchildren belonging to
our previous neighbors (with whom we were very
close) arrived in Saratoga Springs which is clearly
prospering under your custody 
Indeed, until yesterday afternoon and despite my
vigilant casting about, I have been unable to discover
a single instance of reasons for public-spirited concern,
much less complaint 
You may easily appreciate, then, how it is that
I write to your office, at this date, with utmost
regret for the lamentable circumstances that force
my hand 
Speaking directly to the issue of the moment: 
I have encountered a regular profusion of certain
unidentified roses, growing to no discernible purpose,
and according to no perceptible control, approximately
one quarter mile west of the Northway, on the southern
side 
To be specific, there are practically thousands of
the aforementioned abiding in perpetual near riot
of wild behavior, indiscriminate coloring, and only
the Good Lord Himself can say what diverse soliciting
of promiscuous cross-fertilization 
As I say, these roses, no matter what the apparent
background, training, tropistic tendencies, age,
or color, do not demonstrate the least inclination
toward categorization, specified allegiance, resolute
preference, consideration of the needs of others, or
any other minimal traits of decency 
May I point out that I did not assiduously seek out
this colony, as it were, and that these certain
unidentified roses remain open to viewing even by
children, with or without suitable supervision 
(My wife asks me to append a note as regards the
seasonal but nevertheless seriously licentious
phenomenon of honeysuckle under the moon that one may
apprehend at the corner of Nelson and Main 
However, I have recommended that she undertake direct
correspondence with you, as regards this: yet
another civic disturbance in our midst) 
I am confident that you will devise and pursue
appropriate legal response to the roses in question
If I may aid your efforts in this respect, please
do not hesitate to call me into consultation 
Respectfully yours,

After the Reformation had settled the loamy soil
and the lettuce-green fields of dollars,
the clouds drifted away, and light fell everywhere.
Even the snow bloomed and New Hampshire was a big peony. 
A red barn shone on a hill
with scattered hemlocks and white pines
and the gates of all the picket fences were big shut-eyes.  
2 
Sometime after the Civil War, the bronze wing of liberty   
took off like the ribboning smoke of a Frick factory,
and all the citizens in towns from Stockbridge to Willamette   
ran wild on the 4th. The sound of piccolos lingered,   
and the shiny nickel of the sun stood still before it
fizzed in the windshield of a Ford.
By then you were a lawyer.

Charles Ives was a bandmaster in Danbury, and you didn’t   
give him the time of day. He played shortstop on the piano.   
He never made it to his tonic home base, and his half-tones   
were like oak leaves slapping clapboard.  
4 
How Miltonic are we anyway?     
5 
In that red glass of the imagination,
in that tingling crystal of the chandelier   
where light freezes in its own prism 
and the apogee of the green lawns of New Haven   
wane like Persian carpets in twilight,
there you saw a pitcher, perhaps from Delft,   
next to a plate of mangoes.  
6 
But still, history is a boomerang,
and the aborigines never threw one without a shield.  
7 
Beyond the porches of Key West, beyond the bougainvillea,   
your speech skipped on tepid waves,
was lapped and lapped by lovers and friends,
by scholars who loved romantic nights of the sun. 
But the fruits and pendants, the colorful cloth,
the dry palm fronds, and the fake voodoo wood   
Cortes brought back as souvenirs
were just souvenirs. And the shacks and the cane and the   
hacked plantain were tableaux,
and who saw them from your dark shore?  
8 
The Protestant dinner plate is a segregated place,   
where the steak hardens, and the peas
sit frightened in their corner while mashed potatoes ossify.   
Some gin and ice cream, and the terror of loneliness   
goes for a while.

As they say in the sunny climes,    un abrazo.

The ward beds float like ghost ships
in the darkness, the nightlight
above my bed I pretend is a lighthouse
with a little man inside who wears
a sailor cap and tells good old stories
of the sea. The little man is me.
Perhaps I have a dog called Old Salt
who laps my hand and runs endlessly
down the circular stairs.
Perhaps he bites like sin.
I dream of ships smashing the reefs,
their bottoms gutting out,
the crews’ disembodied voices screaming
Help us help us help somebody please
and there is no one there at all
not even me. I wake up nervous,
Old Salt gnawing my flesh. I wake up nervous,
canvas bedstraps cutting my groin.
The night nurse, making the rounds,
says I bellow in sleep like a foghorn.  
* 
Nothing moves at night
except small animals
kept caged downstairs
for experiments, going
bullshit, and the Creole
janitor’s broom whisking
closer by inches.
In the ward, we all
have room for errors and elbows
to flail at excitement.
We’re right above the morgue;
the iceboxes make our floor
cold. The animals seem to know
when someone, bored with holding
on, gives out: they beat
their heads and teeth
against the chicken wire
doors, scream and claw
The janitor also knows.
He props his heavy broom
against his belt, makes
a sign over himself
learned from a Cajun,
leaves us shaking
in our bedstraps
to drag the still
warm and nervous body
down from Isolation.  
* 
I have a garden in my brain
shaped like a maze
I lose myself
in, it seems. They only look for me
sometimes. I don’t like my dreams. 
The nurses quarrel over where I am
hiding. I hear from inside
a bush. One is crisp
and cuts; one pinches. I’d like to push
them each somewhere. 
They both think it’s funny
here. The laughter sounds like diesels.
I won’t come out because I’m lazy.
You start to like the needles.
You start to want to crazy.

What brings me alive
is less than simplicity,
is a company of soldiers in shiny blue jackets
boiling chickens in the shade         
by the Erasmus Gate, is the fact that my grandfather
died begging for mercy
in a hotel in Atlanta, and that my grandmother, in 1910,
mourned because her breasts
were small. 
I know four men
who paddled the length of the Mississippi
in a dugout they hacked
and burned out of a beech tree. When anyone mentioned rivers
they would look at each other
and their eyes would soften with the memory
of mists and sand bars,
of the grave black brows of river barges. 
I come from a country as large as Brazil,
but all I remember
are the wet silver webs
of golden jungle spiders
netted in the cane. 
I wake up thinking of my brother,
who, on a July morning in 1954,
killed a boy without meaning to.
And I can tell you that this isn’t true,
that my brother didn’t,
as he swept back a four iron
on the lawn of our house in Sea Island,
crack the temple of a boy we had only met
the night before. I can say Yes
I am lying again,
about the boy, about Sea Island,
but as you get up to fix another drink
I will tell you a story
about sleeping in a hay barn in Turkey
and of waking in the night, as, one by one,
the farm hands stood out of the rank straw
to greet us.
                   I want you to know
that my life is a ritual lie
and that I deserve to be loved
anyway. I want you to smile
when I tell of the purple hyacinths
caught in the gears of the raised bridge
over the Chickopee River, I want you to pretend
you were there. 
My sister’s hips were two ax handles wide,
she wept that no one would love her,
my sister, who waded among yellow poppies
and wondered if she were really alive—I want you to wish
you had married her,
I want you to say Please, why did she leave me,
Get her back, O my God,
how can I live without her. I’m not even amazed
that I want you to say this. Listen,
I came downstairs this morning
and somebody had filled the house with flowers.

Art begins with a lie
      The separation is you plus me plus what we make
            Look into lightbulb, blink, sun’s in your eye 
I want a rare sky
      vantage point free from misconception
            Art begins with a lie 
Nothing to lose, spontaneous rise
      of reflection, paint the picture
            of a lightbulb, or eye the sun 
How to fuel the world, then die
      Distance yourself from artfulness
            How? Art begins with a lie 
The audience wants to cry
      when the actors are real & passionate
            Look into footlight, then feed back to eye 
You fluctuate in an artful body
      You try to imitate the world’s glory
            Art begins with a lie
                  That’s the story, sharp speck in the eye.

Go, soul, the body’s guest,Upon a thankless errand;Fear not to touch the best;The truth shall be thy warrant.Go, since I needs must die,And give the world the lie.
Say to the court, it glowsAnd shines like rotten wood;Say to the church, it showsWhat’s good, and doth no good.If church and court reply,Then give them both the lie.
Tell potentates, they live Acting by others’ action;Not loved unless they give,Not strong but by a faction.If potentates reply,Give potentates the lie.
Tell men of high condition,That manage the estate,Their purpose is ambition,Their practice only hate.And if they once reply,Then give them all the lie.
Tell them that brave it most,They beg for more by spending,Who, in their greatest cost,Seek nothing but commending.And if they make reply,Then give them all the lie.
Tell zeal it wants devotion;Tell love it is but lust;Tell time it is but motion;Tell flesh it is but dust.And wish them not reply,For thou must give the lie.
Tell age it daily wasteth;Tell honor how it alters;Tell beauty how she blasteth;Tell favor how it falters.And as they shall reply,Give every one the lie.
Tell wit how much it wranglesIn tickle points of niceness;Tell wisdom she entanglesHerself in overwiseness.And when they do reply, Straight give them both the lie.
Tell physic of her boldness;Tell skill it is pretension;Tell charity of coldness;Tell law it is contention.And as they do reply,So give them still the lie.
Tell fortune of her blindness;Tell nature of decay;Tell friendship of unkindness;Tell justice of delay.And if they will reply,Then give them all the lie.
Tell arts they have no soundness,But vary by esteeming;Tell schools they want profoundness,And stand too much on seeming.If arts and schools reply,Give arts and schools the lie.
Tell faith it’s fled the city;Tell how the country erreth;Tell manhood shakes off pity;Tell virtue least preferreth.And if they do reply,Spare not to give the lie.
So when thou hast, as ICommanded thee, done blabbing—Although to give the lieDeserves no less than stabbing—Stab at thee he that will,No stab the soul can kill.

Animula, vagula, blandula.



Life! I know not what thou art,    But know that thou and I must part;    And when, or how, or where we met,    I own to me’s a secret yet.    But this I know, when thou art fled,    Where’er they lay these limbs, this head,    No clod so valueless shall be,    As all that then remains of me.    O whither, whither dost thou fly,    Where bend unseen thy trackless course,       And in this strange divorce, Ah tell where I must seek this compound I?  To the vast ocean of empyreal flame,       From whence thy essence came,       Dost thou thy flight pursue, when freed       From matter’s base encumbering weed?          Or dost thou, hid from sight,          Wait, like some spell-bound knight, Through blank oblivious years th’ appointed hour, To break thy trance and reassume thy power? Yet canst thou without thought or feeling be? O say what art thou, when no more thou ’rt thee?        Life! we’ve been long together,       Through pleasant and through cloudy weather;          ’Tis hard to part when friends are dear;          Perhaps ’t will cost a sigh, a tear;          Then steal away, give little warning,             Choose thine own time;       Say not Good night, but in some brighter clime             Bid me Good morning.

I made a posy, while the day ran by: “Here will I smell my remnant out, and tie                            My life within this band.” But Time did beckon to the flowers, and they By noon most cunningly did steal away,                            And withered in my hand.  My hand was next to them, and then my heart; I took, without more thinking, in good part                            Time’s gentle admonition; Who did so sweetly death’s sad taste convey, Making my mind to smell my fatal day,                            Yet, sug’ring the suspicion.  Farewell dear flowers, sweetly your time ye spent, Fit, while ye lived, for smell or ornament,                            And after death for cures. I follow straight without complaints or grief, Since, if my scent be good, I care not if                            It be as short as yours.

Down the street, someone must be praying, and though I don’t
Go there anymore, I want to at times, to hear the diction
And the tone, though the English pronoun for God is obsolete— 
What goes on is devotion, which wouldn’t change if I heard:
The polished sermon, the upright’s arpeggios of vacant notes.
What else could unite widows, bankers, children, and ghosts? 
And those faces are so good as they tilt their smiles upward
To the rostrum that represents law, and the minister who
Represents God beams like the white palm of the good hand 
Of Christ raised behind the baptistry to signal the multitude,
Which I am not among, though I feel the abundance of calm
And know the beatitude so well I do not have to imagine it, 
Or the polite old ones who gather after the service to chat,
Or the ritual linen of Sunday tables that are already set.
More than any other days, Sundays stand in unvarying rows 
That beg attention: there is that studied verisimilitude
Of sanctuary, so even mud and bitten weeds look dressed up
For some eye in the distant past, some remote kingdom 
Where the pastures are crossed by thoroughly symbolic rivers.
That is why the syntax of prayers is so often reversed,
Aimed toward the dead who clearly have not gone ahead 
But returned to prior things, a vista of angels and sheep,
A desert where men in robes and sandals gather by a tree.
Hushed stores, all day that sense a bell is about to ring— 
I recognized it, waking up, before I weighed the bulk of news
Or saw Saturday night’s cars parked randomly along the curb,
And though I had no prayer, I wanted to offer something 
Or ask for something, perhaps out of habit, but as the past
Must always be honored unconsciously, formally, and persists
On this first and singular day, though I think of it as last.


^^EOP^^

After you've been to bed together for the first time,
without the advantage or disadvantage of any prior acquaintance,
the other party very often says to you,
Tell me about yourself, I want to know all about you,
what's your story? And you think maybe they really and truly do 
sincerely want to know your life story, and so you light up
a cigarette and begin to tell it to them, the two of you
lying together in completely relaxed positions
like a pair of rag dolls a bored child dropped on a bed. 
You tell them your story, or as much of your story
as time or a fair degree of prudence allows, and they say,
       Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
each time a little more faintly, until the oh
is just an audible breath, and then of course 
there's some interruption. Slow room service comes up
with a bowl of melting ice cubes, or one of you rises to pee
and gaze at himself with the mild astonishment in the bathroom mirror.
And then, the first thing you know, before you've had time
to pick up where you left off with your enthralling life story,
they're telling you their life story, exactly as they'd intended to all along, 
and you're saying, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
each time a little more faintly, the vowel at last becoming
no more than an audible sigh,
as the elevator, halfway down the corridor and a turn to the left,
draws one last, long, deep breath of exhaustion
and stops breathing forever. Then? 
Well, one of you falls asleep
and the other one does likewise with a lighted cigarette in his mouth,
and that's how people burn to death in hotel rooms.

In a stable of boats I lie still,
From all sleeping children hidden.   
The leap of a fish from its shadow   
Makes the whole lake instantly tremble.   
With my foot on the water, I feel   
The moon outside 
Take on the utmost of its power.
I rise and go out through the boats.   
I set my broad sole upon silver,
On the skin of the sky, on the moonlight,   
Stepping outward from earth onto water   
In quest of the miracle 
This village of children believed   
That I could perform as I dived
For one who had sunk from my sight.   
I saw his cropped haircut go under.   
I leapt, and my steep body flashed   
Once, in the sun. 
Dark drew all the light from my eyes.   
Like a man who explores his death
By the pull of his slow-moving shoulders,   
I hung head down in the cold,
Wide-eyed, contained, and alone
Among the weeds, 
And my fingertips turned into stone   
From clutching immovable blackness.   
Time after time I leapt upward
Exploding in breath, and fell back   
From the change in the children’s faces   
At my defeat. 
Beneath them I swam to the boathouse   
With only my life in my arms
To wait for the lake to shine back
At the risen moon with such power   
That my steps on the light of the ripples   
Might be sustained. 
Beneath me is nothing but brightness   
Like the ghost of a snowfield in summer.   
As I move toward the center of the lake,   
Which is also the center of the moon,   
I am thinking of how I may be
The savior of one 
Who has already died in my care.   
The dark trees fade from around me.   
The moon’s dust hovers together.   
I call softly out, and the child’s
Voice answers through blinding water.   
Patiently, slowly, 
He rises, dilating to break
The surface of stone with his forehead.   
He is one I do not remember
Having ever seen in his life.
The ground I stand on is trembling   
Upon his smile. 
I wash the black mud from my hands.   
On a light given off by the grave   
I kneel in the quick of the moon   
At the heart of a distant forest   
And hold in my arms a child   
Of water, water, water.

A group of young men in Jacksonville, Florida, arranged to celebrate Lincoln’s birthday in 1900. My brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, and I decided to write a song to be sung at the exercises. I wrote the words and he wrote the music. Our New York publisher, Edward B. Marks, made mimeographed copies for us, and the song was taught to and sung by a chorus of five hundred colored school children.  Shortly afterwards my brother and I moved away from Jacksonville to New York, and the song passed out of our minds. But the school children of Jacksonville kept singing it; they went off to other schools and sang it; they became teachers and taught it to other children. Within twenty years it was being sung over the South and in some other parts of the country. Today the song, popularly known as the Negro National Hymn, is quite generally used.  The lines of this song repay me in an elation, almost of exquisite anguish, whenever I hear them sung by Negro children.



Lift every voice and sing   Till earth and heaven ring, Ring with the harmonies of Liberty; Let our rejoicing rise High as the listening skies, Let it resound loud as the rolling sea. Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us, Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.   Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, Let us march on till victory is won.  Stony the road we trod, Bitter the chastening rod, Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;   Yet with a steady beat, Have not our weary feet Come to the place for which our fathers sighed? We have come over a way that with tears has been watered, We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered, Out from the gloomy past,   Till now we stand at last Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.  God of our weary years,   God of our silent tears, Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way; Thou who hast by Thy might   Led us into the light, Keep us forever in the path, we pray. Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee, Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee; Shadowed beneath Thy hand,   May we forever stand.   True to our God, True to our native land.

The white clothes on the line put the man to sleep.
He was sitting on a soda case
Leaning back on the porch. 
He rolled down his sleeves with his eyes shut.
He could feel the sun going into the trees. 
He wanted to catch the evening ferry
And meet someone across the river. 
He dreamed about her
Putting polish on her nails.
He was in the woods and many women
Were walking around him in a circle.
He thought about crosses in their blood. 
As it got to be night he could feel the heat in his face.
He was going to open his eyes.
And look up at the moon.
It was like the light blue handkerchief
She gave him to go with his dark suit. 
That’s when he felt the hot salt all over him
Like broken glass.
He was afraid to open his eyes.
He wondered if he could use any words on it.
But the big woman in the black dress
Was already in the backseat of the car
Rolling the window up with one hand
And making a sign on him with the other. 
She was in the car, too.
He saw her biting her nails when they pulled away. 
There was a dead snake on his shoes.
He knew there would be a circle
Of little beating hearts in his bed,
And before he could get home
They would be dry and still.


^^EOP^^

The rake is like a wand or fan,   
With bamboo springing in a span   
To catch the leaves that I amass   
In bushels on the evening grass. 
I reckon how the wind behaves   
And rake them lightly into waves   
And rake the waves upon a pile,   
Then stop my raking for a while. 
The sun is down, the air is blue,   
And soon the fingers will be, too,   
But there are children to appease   
With ducking in those leafy seas. 
So loudly rummaging their bed
On the dry billows of the dead,
They are not warned at four and three   
Of natural mortality. 
Before their supper they require   
A dragon field of yellow fire
To light and toast them in the gloom.   
So much for old earth’s ashen doom.

How little we know,   
and when we know it! 
It was prettily said that “No man
hath an abundance of cows on the plain, nor shards
in his cupboard.” Wait! I think I know who said that! It was . . . 
Never mind, dears, the afternoon
will fold you up, along with preoccupations   
that now seem so important, until only a child   
running around on a unicycle occupies center stage.   
Then what will you make of walls? And I fear you   
will have to come up with something, 
be it a terraced gambit above the sea
or gossip overheard in the marketplace.
For you see, it becomes you to be chastened:
for the old to envy the young,
and for youth to fear not getting older,
where the paths through the elms, the carnivals, begin. 
And it was said of Gyges that his ring
attracted those who saw him not,
just as those who wandered through him were aware
only of a certain stillness, such as precedes an earache,
while lumberjacks in headbands came down to see what all the fuss was about,
whether it was something they could be part of sans affront to self-esteem.
And those temple hyenas who had seen enough,
nostrils aflare, fur backing up in the breeze,
were no place you could count on,
having taken a proverbial powder
as rifle butts received another notch.
I, meanwhile . . . I was going to say I had squandered spring   
when summer came along and took it from me   
like a terrier a lady has asked one to hold for a moment
while she adjusts her stocking in the mirror of a weighing machine.   
But here it is winter, and wrong
to speak of other seasons as though they exist.   
Time has only an agenda
in the wallet at his back, while we
who think we know where we are going unfazed
end up in brilliant woods, nourished more than we can know
by the unexpectedness of ice and stars
and crackling tears. We’ll just have to make a go of it,
a run for it. And should the smell of baking cookies appease
one or the other of the olfactory senses, climb down   
into this wagonload of prisoners. 
The meter will be screamingly clear then,
the rhythms unbounced, for though we came
to life as to a school, we must leave it without graduating   
even as an ominous wind puffs out the sails
of proud feluccas who don’t know where they’re headed,   
only that a motion is etched there, shaking to be free.

She stands beside me, stands away,   
the vague indifference
of her dreams. Dreaming, to go on,   
and go on there, like animals fleeing   
the rise of the earth. But standing   
intangible, my lust a worked anger
a sweating close covering, for the crudely salty soul. 
Then back off, and where you go? Box of words   
and pictures. Steel balloons tied to our mouths.   
The room fills up, and the house. Street tilts.   
City slides, and buildings slide into the river.   
What is there left, to destroy? That is not close,   
or closer. Leaning away in the angle of language.   
Pumping and pumping, all our eyes criss cross
and flash. It is the lovers pulling down empty structures.   
They wait and touch and watch their dreams   
eat the morning.

1    Dear Milton, 
      Rain. But when you are here, alone, what does it
      mean. It means psalm — that song sung to the harp.
      Like trees, we too hold on to the earth — pull and
      twang for another tongue. It (whatever it is, and
      who knows that) is a sacred song. It is strange for
      we are the ones who glorify mystery with our arms.
      We call it testament because it pries at our souls
      with many branches, and so you say with a huge
      eye, we must practice our art like the third stomach
      of a cud-chewing animal: 
                     “Myrtle, Woodbine, Appletrees, Trillium,
                      here they are, the strength of your arm
                      stalls at the open gate of the stars. 
                      Feel everything, trust everything!”

^^EOP^^

The victorious army marches into the city,
& not far behind tarries a throng of women
Who slept with the enemy on the edge
Of battlements. The stunned morning 
Opens into a dust cloud of hooves
& drums. Some new priests cradle
Stone tablets, & others are poised
With raised mallets in a forest of defeated 
Statuary. Of course, behind them
Linger the turncoats & pious
Merchants of lime. What’s Greek
Is forged into Roman; what’s Roman 
Is hammered into a ceremony of birds
Headed east. Whatever is marble
Burns in the lime kilns because
Someone dreams of a domed bathhouse.

1
As she grows to twelve, her body begins
Its Spring, its hike along the trail
In the mountains that open
Suddenly to show a whole valley
So surprising one forgets
For the moment to breathe.
Her hips, and so her walk,
Her breasts, and so
The way she begins to see
How other people look at her,
How they are caught mid-breath, and shy.
But the day a train first came here,
They look at her like that:
No one staring at her face, no one
Noting a moustache curling up
Like the arms of the bald
He-man posing in the traveling circus
There on the face of the engineer.
She gets angry, steam in her head
The way the engine had
Barely held in, almost bursting.
Angry in the manner that a person might
Take an egg and hold it too hard.
Her breasts begin to grow,
And she gets angry.
Or, she gets angry,
So her breasts begin to grow.
She cannot remember exactly which. 
Her mother had told her
This would come,
But told her so quickly, so much
In a hurry and in a small room,
And with the other things,
She neglected to say that also
They would stop growing,
So they might not.
She would have to wear—
She learns this in a dream—
High heels backward on her feet
To keep a symmetry of balance.
The angrier she gets through the months,
The more worried she feels
At the silliness of how
She has begun to grow two new shoulders,
Of how she will have to wear her shoes,
As bigger, one centimeter at a time,
She sprouts out like buds, at first,
Like fast plants,
Then, like the trees,
And finally unstoppable
In their season: fruit.
The future, she reasons, cannot be good. 
2
At 28, she has forgotten what is past.
She sits and watches now her thighs
Flowing out like the broad
Varicosed backs of alligators
She has seen in moving pictures,
Pushed out around the metal
Edges of the lawn chair.
Long and flat animals,
Sated and full of wrinkling
Ridges, held as if by small bones
The way camping tents are suspended,
All from having eaten
Too many pigs, too many birds and cows
In the summers of her middle
Years of crying
When she was all mouth and chewing
To feel better, all without boys,
No Pedro of her own
And now the boys cannot
Come close, dare not
Dare the alligators
Which might come after them.  
3
But no. This is an exaggeration,
This sadness
At het self. Sadness is like that,
Adding weight to a thing, to legs
The way legs look as one sits
In a chair relaxed,
Or on the edge of a wall.
As if one were a circus performer
With a partner, Ramón, Ramón standing
Feet planted this moment precisely
On the thighs. 
But no. This is a further exaggeration.
Sadness again is like that,
It learns you, she thinks,
Makes you heavy in those places exactly
You have dared think to be strong.
On Thursday the 8th of this month
Miguel her husband left her,
But in that odd physics of how distance
Increased every step she took
Away from him.
As she left the house, he got farther.
As she, his María, walked out the door
He left her, and the more she walked
The farther he got, and smaller.
She had learned him as one learns
A pair of good leather shoes.
She loved him so much
She stopped thinking about him.
He was like breathing.
So that when sadness called, she went
To see what it wanted
And did not worry.
Sadness, again, is like that,
Not telling a person the whole story.  
4 The orchard was his passion now
More than women,
More than hard words and fast guns
In the hands of other men.
And he tended his trees with fingers
He might have used touching
The hair of his young cousin, lovely
Marta, his wife, light skinned,
Eyes the color in the moss
And barks of his trees,
Who walked to the river and stayed.
Fingers that might have
Pointed out to her with care
The beaten line a trail made
Leading to his house, their house.
But he was busy growing the limes
So that her hair was like a bramble
Having to be torn away
Hard from her, leaving the blood.

Tell yourself
as it gets cold and gray falls from the air
that you will go on
walking, hearing
the same tune no matter where
you find yourself—
inside the dome of dark
or under the cracking white
of the moon's gaze in a valley of snow.
Tonight as it gets cold
tell yourself
what you know which is nothing
but the tune your bones play
as you keep going. And you will be able
for once to lie down under the small fire
of winter stars.
And if it happens that you cannot
go on or turn back
and you find yourself
where you will be at the end,
tell yourself
in that final flowing of cold through your limbs
that you love what you are.

Sullen, grimy, labouring person,       As I passed you in my car, I could sense your muffled curse on       It and me and my cigar; And though mute your malediction,       I could feel it on my head, As in countless works of fiction             I have read.  Envy of mine obvious leisure       Seemed to green your glittering eye; Hate for mine apparent pleasure       Filled you as I motored by. You who had to dig for three, four       Hours in that unpleasant ditch, Loathed, despised, and hated me for             Being rich.  And you cursed me into Hades       As you envied me that ride With the loveliest of ladies       Sitting at my dexter side; And your wish, or your idea,       Was to hurl us off some cliff. I could see that you thought me a             Lucky stiff.  If you came to the decision,       As my car you mutely cussed, That allottment and division       Are indecently unjust— Labouring man, however came you       Thus to think the world awry, I should be the last to blame you …             So do I.

I heard a thousand blended notes, While in a grove I sate reclined, In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts Bring sad thoughts to the mind.  To her fair works did Nature link The human soul that through me ran; And much it grieved my heart to think What man has made of man.  Through primrose tufts, in that green bower, The periwinkle trailed its wreaths; And ’tis my faith that every flower Enjoys the air it breathes.  The birds around me hopped and played, Their thoughts I cannot measure:— But the least motion which they made It seemed a thrill of pleasure.  The budding twigs spread out their fan, To catch the breezy air; And I must think, do all I can, That there was pleasure there.  If this belief from heaven be sent, If such be Nature’s holy plan, Have I not reason to lament What man has made of man?

In the sad November time, When the leaf has left the lime, And the Cam, with sludge and slime,       Plasters his ugly channel, While, with sober step and slow, Round about the marshes low, Stiffening students stumping go       Shivering through their flannel.  Then to me in doleful mood Rises up a question rude, Asking what sufficient good       Comes of this mode of living? Moping on from day to day, Grinding up what will not “pay,” Till the jaded brain gives way       Under its own misgiving.  Why should wretched Man employ Years which Nature meant for joy, Striving vainly to destroy       Freedom of thought and feeling? Still the injured powers remain Endless stores of hopeless pain, When at last the vanquished brain       Languishes past all healing.  Where is then his wealth of mind— All the schemes that Hope designed? Gone, like spring, to leave behind       Indolent melancholy. Thus he ends his helpless days, Vex’t with thoughts of former praise— Tell me, how are Wisdom’s ways       Better than senseless Folly?  Happier those whom trifles please, Dreaming out a life of ease, Sinking by unfelt degrees       Into annihilation. Or the slave, to labour born, Heedless of the freeman’s scorn, Destined to be slowly worn       Down to the brute creation.  Thus a tempting spirit spoke, As from troubled sleep I woke To a morning thick with smoke,       Sunless and damp and chilly. Then to sleep I turned once more, Eyes inflamed and windpipe sore, Dreaming dreams I dreamt before,       Only not quite so silly.  In my dream methought I strayed Where a learned-looking maid Stores of flimsy goods displayed,       Articles not worth wearing. “These,” she said, with solemn air, “Are the robes that sages wear, Warranted, when kept with care,       Never to need repairing.”  Then unnumbered witlings, caught By her wiles, the trappings bought, And by labour, not by thought,       Honour and fame were earning. While the men of wiser mind Passed for blind among the blind; Pedants left them far behind       In the career of learning.  “Those that fix their eager eyes Ever on the nearest prize Well may venture to despise       Loftier aspirations. Pedantry is in demand! Buy it up at second-hand, Seek no more to understand       Profitless speculations.”  Thus the gaudy gowns were sold, Cast off sloughs of pedants old; Proudly marched the students bold       Through the domain of error, Till their trappings, false though fair, Mouldered off and left them bare, Clustering close in blank despair,       Nakedness, cold, and terror.  Then, I said, “These haughty Schools Boast that by their formal rules They produce more learned fools       Than could be well expected. Learned fools they are indeed, Learned in the books they read; Fools whene’er they come to need       Wisdom, too long neglected.  “Oh! that men indeed were wise, And would raise their purblind eyes To the opening mysteries       Scattered around them ever. Truth should spring from sterile ground, Beauty beam from all around, Right should then at last be found       Joining what none may sever.”

Content that now the bleeding bone be swept
Out of her reach, she lay upon her side.
In a blonde void sunk deep, she slept, she slept
Bland as a child, slept, breathing like a bride.
Color of noons that shimmer as they sing
Above the dunes, her sandy flanks heaved slow.
Between her paws curled inward, billowing
Waves of desert silence seemed to flow. 
The crowd was gone, the bars were gone, the cage
Thinned into air, the sawdust and the fleas
Winnowed by sleep to nothing. After food,
Absence possessed her: bliss keener than rage,
If slumber’s prisoner at a bound could seize
This ghostly freedom, lapping it like blood.

Last night I traced with my finger   
the long scar on my love’s stomach
as if I was following a road on a map.
I heard the scream of tires, saw the flash 
of chrome, her six-year-old body   
a rag doll bleeding at the seams.
It is foolish of me to wish
I was there before it happened, to reach 
back thirty years, clasp her small hand   
and pull her away from that speeding car   
that turned her organs into bruised fruit.   
How easily she could have missed 
her seventh birthday, the lit candles waiting   
for her to blow out their tiny flames.   
How easily I could’ve spent last night   
in a crowded bar instead, 
my shoulders brushing against strangers,   
a man on the jukebox
singing his heart out to a woman
with the prettiest eyes he’s ever seen.

‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller,      Knocking on the moonlit door; And his horse in the silence champed the grasses      Of the forest’s ferny floor: And a bird flew up out of the turret,      Above the Traveller’s head: And he smote upon the door again a second time;      ‘Is there anybody there?’ he said. But no one descended to the Traveller;      No head from the leaf-fringed sill Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,      Where he stood perplexed and still. But only a host of phantom listeners      That dwelt in the lone house then Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight      To that voice from the world of men: Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,      That goes down to the empty hall, Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken      By the lonely Traveller’s call. And he felt in his heart their strangeness,      Their stillness answering his cry, While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,      ’Neath the starred and leafy sky; For he suddenly smote on the door, even      Louder, and lifted his head:— ‘Tell them I came, and no one answered,      That I kept my word,’ he said. Never the least stir made the listeners,      Though every word he spake Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house      From the one man left awake: Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,      And the sound of iron on stone, And how the silence surged softly backward,      When the plunging hoofs were gone.

Every morning the maple leaves.
                               Every morning another chapter where the hero shifts
            from one foot to the other. Every morning the same big
and little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out
                                             You will be alone always and then you will die.
So maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalog
         of non-definitive acts,
something other than the desperation.
                   Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I couldn’t come to your party.
Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I came to your party
         and seduced you
and left you bruised and ruined, you poor sad thing.
                                                         You want a better story. Who wouldn’t?
A forest, then. Beautiful trees. And a lady singing.
                  Love on the water, love underwater, love, love and so on.
What a sweet lady. Sing lady, sing! Of course, she wakes the dragon.
            Love always wakes the dragon and suddenly
                                                                                               flames everywhere.
I can tell already you think I’m the dragon,
                that would be so like me, but I’m not. I’m not the dragon.
I’m not the princess either.
                           Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.
I walk through your dreams and invent the future. Sure,
               I sink the boat of love, but that comes later. And yes, I swallow
         glass, but that comes later.
                                                            And the part where I push you
flush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks,
            shut up
I’m getting to it.
                                    For a while I thought I was the dragon.
I guess I can tell you that now. And, for a while, I thought I was
                                                                                                the princess,
cotton candy pink, sitting there in my room, in the tower of the castle,
          young and beautiful and in love and waiting for you with
confidence
            but the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess,
while I’m out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire,
                                                               and getting stabbed to death.
                                    Okay, so I’m the dragon. Big deal.
          You still get to be the hero.
You get magic gloves! A fish that talks! You get eyes like flashlights!
                  What more do you want?
I make you pancakes, I take you hunting, I talk to you as if you’re
            really there.
Are you there, sweetheart? Do you know me? Is this microphone live?
                                                       Let me do it right for once,
             for the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes,
you know the story, simply heaven.
                   Inside your head you hear a phone ringing
                                                               and when you open your eyes
only a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer.
                               Inside your head the sound of glass,
a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion.
             Hello darling, sorry about that.
                                                       Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we
lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell
                                    and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud.
            Especially that, but I should have known.
You see, I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together
            to make a creature that will do what I say
or love me back.
                  I’m not really sure why I do it, but in this version you are not
feeding yourself to a bad man
                                                   against a black sky prickled with small lights.
            I take it back.
The wooden halls like caskets. These terms from the lower depths.
                                                I take them back.
Here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed.
                                                                                               Crossed out.
            Clumsy hands in a dark room. Crossed out. There is something
underneath the floorboards.
                   Crossed out. And here is the tabernacle
                                                                                                reconstructed.
Here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all
               forgiven,
even though we didn’t deserve it.
                                                                    Inside your head you hear
a phone ringing, and when you open your eyes you’re washing up
            in a stranger’s bathroom,
standing by the window in a yellow towel, only twenty minutes away
                           from the dirtiest thing you know.
All the rooms of the castle except this one, says someone, and suddenly
                                                                                              darkness,
                                                                                     suddenly only darkness.
In the living room, in the broken yard,
                                  in the back of the car as the lights go by. In the airport
          bathroom’s gurgle and flush, bathed in a pharmacy of
unnatural light,
             my hands looking weird, my face weird, my feet too far away.
And then the airplane, the window seat over the wing with a view
                                                            of the wing and a little foil bag of peanuts.
I arrived in the city and you met me at the station,
          smiling in a way
                    that made me frightened. Down the alley, around the arcade,
          up the stairs of the building
to the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things,
                                                I looked out the window and said
                                This doesn’t look that much different from home,
            because it didn’t,
but then I noticed the black sky and all those lights.
                                           We walked through the house to the elevated train.
            All these buildings, all that glass and the shiny beautiful
                                                                                             mechanical wind.
We were inside the train car when I started to cry. You were crying too,
            smiling and crying in a way that made me
even more hysterical. You said I could have anything I wanted, but I
                                                                                      just couldn’t say it out loud.
Actually, you said Love, for you,
                                 is larger than the usual romantic love. It’s like a religion. It’s
                                                                                                 terrifying. No one
                                                                                 will ever want to sleep with you.

Little Boy Blue,
please cover your nose.
You sneezed on Miss Muffet
and ruined her clothes.
You sprayed Mother Hubbard,
and now she is sick.
You put out the fire   
on Jack’s candlestick.
Your sneeze is the reason   
why Humpty fell down.
You drenched Yankee Doodle
when he came to town.
The blind mice are angry!
The sheep are upset!
From now on use tissues
so no one gets wet!


^^EOP^^

Withouten you
No rose can grow;
No leaf be green
If never seen
Your sweetest face;
No bird have grace
Or power to sing;
Or anything
Be kind, or fair,
And you nowhere.

I buried my father
in the sky.
Since then, the birds
clean and comb him every morning   
and pull the blanket up to his chin   
every night. 
I buried my father underground.   
Since then, my ladders
only climb down,
and all the earth has become a house   
whose rooms are the hours, whose doors   
stand open at evening, receiving   
guest after guest.
Sometimes I see past them
to the tables spread for a wedding feast. 
I buried my father in my heart.
Now he grows in me, my strange son,   
my little root who won’t drink milk,   
little pale foot sunk in unheard-of night,   
little clock spring newly wet
in the fire, little grape, parent to the future   
wine, a son the fruit of his own son,   
little father I ransom with my life.

An apple paring
curled from the knife wetly
    down my thumb—
and what I had failed
to do rightly touching that life
    next to mine, wearing
late afternoon’s numb
luminosity, impaled me. 
    A hunter knee-deep
in salt marsh, whom Anton Chekov
might have set there and then left,
    back to doctoring,
or choked off as too dark, wanton,
    met the steep
flailing of teal, trailed their shrill lift,
but stood only, hearing them. 
    Pouring the last tea
of an evening, dark amber
alive, breathing in quintessence
    of India,
I felt limber bark
sheathing the shrub of my life’s tree
with root good, but dense,
dark, local, raw there, 
    and so in dark woke,
the seeing doctor, two simple
profiles of linked characters
    in his air, 
cruel, good, a pair ample, true
across that split yoke,
true to its splayed force—
simple so rare, though.

—Once more the poem woke me up,
the dark poem. I was ready for it;
he was sleeping,
         
and across the cabin, the small furnace
lit and re-lit itself—the flame a yellow
      “tongue” again, the metal benignly
hard again; 
and a thousand insects outside called
      and made me nothing;
moonlight streamed inside as if it had been ...
         
I looked around, I thought of the lower wisdom,
spirit held by matter:
      Mary, white as a sand dollar, 
and Christ, his sticky halo tilted—
      oh, to get behind it!
The world had been created to comprehend itself 
as matter: table, the torn
veils of spiders ... Even consciousness—
missing my love— 
was matter, the metal box of a furnace.
As the obligated flame, so burned my life ...
         
What is the meaning of this suffering I asked
and the voice—not Christ but between us—
said you are the meaning. 
No no, I replied, That
is the shape, what is the meaning.
You are the meaning, it said—

I know a little language of my cat, though Dante says   
that animals have no need of speech and Nature   
abhors the superfluous.   My cat is fluent.   He   
converses when he wants with me.   To speak 
is natural.   And whales and wolves I’ve heard   
in choral soundings of the sea and air
know harmony and have an eloquence that stirs   
my mind and heart—they touch the soul.   Here 
Dante’s religion that would set Man apart   
damns the effluence of our life from us   
to build therein its powerhouse. 
It’s in his animal communication Man is   
      true, immediate, and   
in immediacy, Man is all animal. 
His senses quicken in the thick of the symphony,
      old circuits of animal rapture and alarm,
attentions and arousals in which an identity rearrives.
      He hears
particular voices among
      the concert, the slightest   
rustle in the undertones,
      rehearsing a nervous aptitude   
yet to prove his. He sees the flick
      of significant red within the rushing mass
of ruddy wilderness and catches the glow
      of a green shirt
to delite him in a glowing field of green
      —it speaks to him—
and in the arc of the spectrum color   
      speaks to color.
The rainbow articulates
      a promise he remembers   
he but imitates
      in noises that he makes, 
this speech in every sense   
the world surrounding him.
He picks up on the fugitive tang of mace
      amidst the savory mass,
and taste in evolution is an everlasting key.
      There is a pun of scents in what makes sense. 
      Myrrh it may have been,
the odor of the announcement that filld the house. 
      He wakes from deepest sleep    
upon a distant signal and waits    
      as if crouching, springs 
      to life.

Spotlight a 
   SCENE ONE: Open-air court in the ancient city of Athens. The accused arrive
                      and proceed among curses and cries of Death! Death! 
   SCENE TWO: A jail in the same city, beneath the Acropolis, walls half-eaten by
                      dampness. On the ground, a miserly straw mat and in the corner,
                      an earthenware jar of water. On the outside wall, a shadow: the
                      guard. 
SCENE THREE: Constantinople. In the harem of the Holy Place, in candlelight,
                      the Queen throws a pouch of gold coins to the Head Eunuch
                      who bows and looks at her significantly. By the open door, his
                      men at the ready. 
   SCENE FOUR: Drawing room of a large Monastery. Oblong table, the abbot at
                      its head. Sweaty monks come and go bringing news: a crowd
                      spills into the streets, setting fires, destroying everything. 
   SCENE FIVE: Nauplio. Greek and Bavarian officers outside the King’s quarters
                      converse in low tones. A messenger takes the dispatch and heads
                      toward the steps that lead on high to Palamidi. 
    SCENE SIX: In front of an old and empty lot in contemporary Athens, a
                      crowd, motley with priests and bishops, gathers to cast a stone,
                      “the stone of anathema.” 
SCENE SEVEN: Low buildings of EAT/ESA. In the courtyard, drunken soldiers.
                      Braying and lewd posturing. The officer leaving some cell says
                      something to the military doctor. Behind them thuds and cries
                      are heard.

It was biting cold, and the falling snow, Which filled a poor little match girl’s heart with woe, Who was bareheaded and barefooted, as she went along the street, Crying, “Who’ll buy my matches? for I want pennies to buy some meat!”  When she left home she had slippers on; But, alas! poor child, now they were gone. For she lost both of them while hurrying across the street, Out of the way of two carriages which were near by her feet.  So the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and fast; And the child’s heart felt cold and downcast, For nobody had bought any matches that day, Which filled her little mind with grief and dismay.  Alas! she was hungry and shivering with cold; So in a corner between two houses she made bold To take shelter from the violent storm. Poor little waif! wishing to herself she’d never been born.  And she grew colder and colder, and feared to go home For fear of her father beating her; and she felt woe-begone Because she could carry home no pennies to buy bread, And to go home without pennies she was in dread.  The large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair hair; While the passers-by for her had no care, As they hurried along to their homes at a quick pace, While the cold wind blew in the match girl’s face.  As night wore on her hands were numb with cold, And no longer her strength could her uphold, When an idea into her little head came: She’d strike a match and warm her hands at the flame.  And she lighted the match, and it burned brightly, And it helped to fill her heart with glee; And she thought she was sitting at a stove very grand; But, alas! she was found dead, with a match in her hand!  Her body was found half-covered with snow, And as the people gazed thereon their hearts were full of woe; And many present let fall a burning tear Because she was found dead on the last night of the year,  In that mighty city of London, wherein is plenty of gold— But, alas! their charity towards street waifs is rather cold. But I hope the match girl’s in Heaven, beside her Saviour dear, A bright reward for all the hardships she suffered here.

The crowded street his playground is, a patch of blue his sky; A puddle in a vacant lot his sea where ships pass by: Poor little orphan boy of five, the city smoke and grime Taint every cooling breeze he gets throughout the summer time; And he is just as your boy is, a child who loves to play, Except that he is drawn and white and cannot get away.  And he would like the open fields, for often in his dreams The angels kind bear him off to where are pleasant streams, Where he may sail a splendid boat, sometimes he flies a kite, Or romps beside a shepherd dog and shouts with all his might; But when the dawn of morning comes he wakes to find once more That what he thought were sun-kissed hills are rags upon the floor.  Then through the hot and sultry day he plays at “make-pretend,” The alley is a sandy beach where all the rich folks send Their little boys and girls to play, a barrel is his boat, But, oh, the air is tifling and the dust fills up his throat; And though he tries so very hard to play, somehow it seems He never gets such wondrous joys as angels bring in dreams.  Poor little orphan boy of five, except that he is pale, With sunken cheeks and hollow eyes and very wan and frail, Just like that little boy of yours, with same desire to play, Fond of the open fields and skies, he’s built the self-same way; But kept by fate and circumstance away from shady streams, His only joy comes when he sleeps and angels bring him dreams.

A courtier speaks to Ch’in Shih-huang-ti, ca. 210 B.C.



Highness, the former walls were helpless. They
stood alone in the middle of small fields
protecting nothing. A single peasant’s holding
engulfed each one as it ran briefly, straight
from noplace off to noplace, with ruinous steps
of broken stone at both ends. Only head-high,
without the towers, gates and towns of your great wall,
they stuck where they were, never rising over hills
or curving through valleys: nothing but shoddy masonry
and a mystery: who built them, how long ago,
what for? They seemed to have no role but balking
the reaper and the ox; their bases made
islands in the flashing scythe-strokes, where wild flowers
and shrubs sprouted. 
                               So all the people praise you
for burying such walls and their memory
in your vast one, which joins them, stretching far
beyond where they once crumbled to hold your Empire:
a wall which therefore can never have an end
but has to go on extending itself forever.
How useful, how cogent your wall is: a pale
for the civilized, a dike against the wild people
outside, who trade their quiet human blood
for the rage of gods, tearing men to pieces,
throwing them, watching them fall. In burying
those little walls, Lord, you have covered our shame
at our ancestors, best forgotten, whose mighty works
were so pointless, or so pitiably useless.
Was all their effort so that daisies could grow in fissures?
So that some human work would rise over the flats
and weather till it seemed not human? Only
so that something of ours could be like trees and rocks:
docile-seeming, yet sullenly opposed
to use, and when compelled, only half serving,
reserving from the functions that we give them
a secret and idle self. The peasants would make
lean-tos for cattle against those walls: they served
for this alone. 
                        Now scholars, Lord, are saying
the gods are not bulls and cows. That in ancient times
we herded these animals to keep from starving
and going naked, and so came the old custom
of thinking them gods—from dependence. In my youth,
I know, the peasants said just the opposite.
Worship came first. The awesome bull and cow
were gathered to be adored more easily,
till people noticed how they let themselves
be driven and penned. Next came the first murders
against these gods, and the careful observation
that they stood to be killed. And so their cult became
contempt of beings that would live with us
and submit to our crimes and hunger, and we began
to breed them. That is why, the farmer says,
cattle are honoured, murdered, eaten, cherished
with labour that makes him their slave, and that is why
in summer he exults in blood, but shivers with fear,
with exhausted terror and regret, and sinks into
stunned revelry all winter, eating the salted meat,
getting children, his house closed up with snow,
himself awake as if he slept, living
as if he had already died, and rich, happy
as if he were a buried worm. 
                                           Is God,
then, Highness, the fat flaccidity of cattle?
Myself, I don’t like to wonder anymore.
I only hope lifelong service earns what I ask:
the command of some far bastion on your wall
where it curves out into the unsettled wastes
beyond any field, and the barrenness inside
is indistinguishable from that without.
This is the reward and end of life I want:
to be a point, though infinitely small
and far from you, in that wide circle centred
on your great self. I see myself arriving
to take charge of my troops. I look down from the tower:
bare plains, outcrops of ice and rock, vast restless
stirrings of grey grasses and dark-veined overcast,
the cold wind’s hissing. Year after year the same,
waiting for an assault that never comes,
straining to glimpse our naked enemies
creeping blended with their stony soil: nothing
but legend, it may be. Maybe a morning
will rise when, waking, I find that I’ve forgotten
which way is north, and can’t tell if I am turned
outward to danger or inward, Highness, to you.
The sun invisible, a murky light diffused
throughout featureless cloud, and the wall so long
no curve appears—it seems to stretch out straight
endlessly east and west: what clue will there be
which way to face my people for the attack?
It will be crucial then to show no doubt.
My orders, I vow, though ignorant, will be crisp.

Somebody’s baby was buried to-day—       The empty white hearse from the grave rumbled back, And the morning somehow seemed less smiling and gay       As I paused on the walk while it crossed on its way, And a shadow seemed drawn o’er the sun’s golden track.  Somebody’s baby was laid out to rest,       White as a snowdrop, and fair to behold, And the soft little hands were crossed over the breast,       And those hands and the lips and the eyelids were pressed With kisses as hot as the eyelids were cold.  Somebody saw it go out of her sight,       Under the coffin lid—out through the door; Somebody finds only darkness and blight       All through the glory of summer-sun light; Somebody’s baby will waken no more.  Somebody’s sorrow is making me weep:       I know not her name, but I echo her cry, For the dearly bought baby she longed so to keep,       The baby that rode to its long-lasting sleep In the little white hearse that went rumbling by.  I know not her name, but her sorrow I know;       While I paused on the crossing I lived it once more, And back to my heart surged that river of woe       That but in the breast of a mother can flow; For the little white hearse has been, too, at my door.

As she grows to twelve, her body begins
Its Spring, its hike along the trail
In the mountains that open
Suddenly to show a whole valley
So surprising one forgets
For the moment to breathe.
Her hips, and so her walk,
Her breasts, and so
The way she begins to see
How other people look at her,
How they are caught mid-breath, and shy.
But the day a train first came here,
They look at her like that:
No one staring at her face, no one
Noting a moustache curling up
Like the arms of the bald
He-man posing in the traveling circus
There on the face of the engineer.
She gets angry, steam in her head
The way the engine had
Barely held in, almost bursting.
Angry in the manner that a person might
Take an egg and hold it too hard.
Her breasts begin to grow,
And she gets angry.
Or, she gets angry,
So her breasts begin to grow.
She cannot remember exactly which. 
Her mother had told her
This would come,
But told her so quickly, so much
In a hurry and in a small room,
And with the other things,
She neglected to say that also
They would stop growing,
So they might not.
She would have to wear—
She learns this in a dream—
High heels backward on her feet
To keep a symmetry of balance.
The angrier she gets through the months,
The more worried she feels
At the silliness of how
She has begun to grow two new shoulders,
Of how she will have to wear her shoes,
As bigger, one centimeter at a time,
She sprouts out like buds, at first,
Like fast plants,
Then, like the trees,
And finally unstoppable
In their season: fruit.
The future, she reasons, cannot be good. 
2
At 28, she has forgotten what is past.
She sits and watches now her thighs
Flowing out like the broad
Varicosed backs of alligators
She has seen in moving pictures,
Pushed out around the metal
Edges of the lawn chair.
Long and flat animals,
Sated and full of wrinkling
Ridges, held as if by small bones
The way camping tents are suspended,
All from having eaten
Too many pigs, too many birds and cows
In the summers of her middle
Years of crying
When she was all mouth and chewing
To feel better, all without boys,
No Pedro of her own
And now the boys cannot
Come close, dare not
Dare the alligators
Which might come after them.  
3
But no. This is an exaggeration,
This sadness
At het self. Sadness is like that,
Adding weight to a thing, to legs
The way legs look as one sits
In a chair relaxed,
Or on the edge of a wall.
As if one were a circus performer
With a partner, Ramón, Ramón standing
Feet planted this moment precisely
On the thighs. 
But no. This is a further exaggeration.
Sadness again is like that,
It learns you, she thinks,
Makes you heavy in those places exactly
You have dared think to be strong.
On Thursday the 8th of this month
Miguel her husband left her,
But in that odd physics of how distance
Increased every step she took
Away from him.
As she left the house, he got farther.
As she, his María, walked out the door
He left her, and the more she walked
The farther he got, and smaller.
She had learned him as one learns
A pair of good leather shoes.
She loved him so much
She stopped thinking about him.
He was like breathing.
So that when sadness called, she went
To see what it wanted
And did not worry.
Sadness, again, is like that,
Not telling a person the whole story.  
4 The orchard was his passion now
More than women,
More than hard words and fast guns
In the hands of other men.
And he tended his trees with fingers
He might have used touching
The hair of his young cousin, lovely
Marta, his wife, light skinned,
Eyes the color in the moss
And barks of his trees,
Who walked to the river and stayed.
Fingers that might have
Pointed out to her with care
The beaten line a trail made
Leading to his house, their house.
But he was busy growing the limes
So that her hair was like a bramble
Having to be torn away
Hard from her, leaving the blood.

Tell yourself
as it gets cold and gray falls from the air
that you will go on
walking, hearing
the same tune no matter where
you find yourself—
inside the dome of dark
or under the cracking white
of the moon's gaze in a valley of snow.
Tonight as it gets cold
tell yourself
what you know which is nothing
but the tune your bones play
as you keep going. And you will be able
for once to lie down under the small fire
of winter stars.
And if it happens that you cannot
go on or turn back
and you find yourself
where you will be at the end,
tell yourself
in that final flowing of cold through your limbs
that you love what you are.

Sullen, grimy, labouring person,       As I passed you in my car, I could sense your muffled curse on       It and me and my cigar; And though mute your malediction,       I could feel it on my head, As in countless works of fiction             I have read.  Envy of mine obvious leisure       Seemed to green your glittering eye; Hate for mine apparent pleasure       Filled you as I motored by. You who had to dig for three, four       Hours in that unpleasant ditch, Loathed, despised, and hated me for             Being rich.  And you cursed me into Hades       As you envied me that ride With the loveliest of ladies       Sitting at my dexter side; And your wish, or your idea,       Was to hurl us off some cliff. I could see that you thought me a             Lucky stiff.  If you came to the decision,       As my car you mutely cussed, That allottment and division       Are indecently unjust— Labouring man, however came you       Thus to think the world awry, I should be the last to blame you …             So do I.

I heard a thousand blended notes, While in a grove I sate reclined, In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts Bring sad thoughts to the mind.  To her fair works did Nature link The human soul that through me ran; And much it grieved my heart to think What man has made of man.  Through primrose tufts, in that green bower, The periwinkle trailed its wreaths; And ’tis my faith that every flower Enjoys the air it breathes.  The birds around me hopped and played, Their thoughts I cannot measure:— But the least motion which they made It seemed a thrill of pleasure.  The budding twigs spread out their fan, To catch the breezy air; And I must think, do all I can, That there was pleasure there.  If this belief from heaven be sent, If such be Nature’s holy plan, Have I not reason to lament What man has made of man?

In the sad November time, When the leaf has left the lime, And the Cam, with sludge and slime,       Plasters his ugly channel, While, with sober step and slow, Round about the marshes low, Stiffening students stumping go       Shivering through their flannel.  Then to me in doleful mood Rises up a question rude, Asking what sufficient good       Comes of this mode of living? Moping on from day to day, Grinding up what will not “pay,” Till the jaded brain gives way       Under its own misgiving.  Why should wretched Man employ Years which Nature meant for joy, Striving vainly to destroy       Freedom of thought and feeling? Still the injured powers remain Endless stores of hopeless pain, When at last the vanquished brain       Languishes past all healing.  Where is then his wealth of mind— All the schemes that Hope designed? Gone, like spring, to leave behind       Indolent melancholy. Thus he ends his helpless days, Vex’t with thoughts of former praise— Tell me, how are Wisdom’s ways       Better than senseless Folly?  Happier those whom trifles please, Dreaming out a life of ease, Sinking by unfelt degrees       Into annihilation. Or the slave, to labour born, Heedless of the freeman’s scorn, Destined to be slowly worn       Down to the brute creation.  Thus a tempting spirit spoke, As from troubled sleep I woke To a morning thick with smoke,       Sunless and damp and chilly. Then to sleep I turned once more, Eyes inflamed and windpipe sore, Dreaming dreams I dreamt before,       Only not quite so silly.  In my dream methought I strayed Where a learned-looking maid Stores of flimsy goods displayed,       Articles not worth wearing. “These,” she said, with solemn air, “Are the robes that sages wear, Warranted, when kept with care,       Never to need repairing.”  Then unnumbered witlings, caught By her wiles, the trappings bought, And by labour, not by thought,       Honour and fame were earning. While the men of wiser mind Passed for blind among the blind; Pedants left them far behind       In the career of learning.  “Those that fix their eager eyes Ever on the nearest prize Well may venture to despise       Loftier aspirations. Pedantry is in demand! Buy it up at second-hand, Seek no more to understand       Profitless speculations.”  Thus the gaudy gowns were sold, Cast off sloughs of pedants old; Proudly marched the students bold       Through the domain of error, Till their trappings, false though fair, Mouldered off and left them bare, Clustering close in blank despair,       Nakedness, cold, and terror.  Then, I said, “These haughty Schools Boast that by their formal rules They produce more learned fools       Than could be well expected. Learned fools they are indeed, Learned in the books they read; Fools whene’er they come to need       Wisdom, too long neglected.  “Oh! that men indeed were wise, And would raise their purblind eyes To the opening mysteries       Scattered around them ever. Truth should spring from sterile ground, Beauty beam from all around, Right should then at last be found       Joining what none may sever.”

Content that now the bleeding bone be swept
Out of her reach, she lay upon her side.
In a blonde void sunk deep, she slept, she slept
Bland as a child, slept, breathing like a bride.
Color of noons that shimmer as they sing
Above the dunes, her sandy flanks heaved slow.
Between her paws curled inward, billowing
Waves of desert silence seemed to flow. 
The crowd was gone, the bars were gone, the cage
Thinned into air, the sawdust and the fleas
Winnowed by sleep to nothing. After food,
Absence possessed her: bliss keener than rage,
If slumber’s prisoner at a bound could seize
This ghostly freedom, lapping it like blood.

Last night I traced with my finger   
the long scar on my love’s stomach
as if I was following a road on a map.
I heard the scream of tires, saw the flash 
of chrome, her six-year-old body   
a rag doll bleeding at the seams.
It is foolish of me to wish
I was there before it happened, to reach 
back thirty years, clasp her small hand   
and pull her away from that speeding car   
that turned her organs into bruised fruit.   
How easily she could have missed 
her seventh birthday, the lit candles waiting   
for her to blow out their tiny flames.   
How easily I could’ve spent last night   
in a crowded bar instead, 
my shoulders brushing against strangers,   
a man on the jukebox
singing his heart out to a woman
with the prettiest eyes he’s ever seen.

‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller,      Knocking on the moonlit door; And his horse in the silence champed the grasses      Of the forest’s ferny floor: And a bird flew up out of the turret,      Above the Traveller’s head: And he smote upon the door again a second time;      ‘Is there anybody there?’ he said. But no one descended to the Traveller;      No head from the leaf-fringed sill Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,      Where he stood perplexed and still. But only a host of phantom listeners      That dwelt in the lone house then Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight      To that voice from the world of men: Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,      That goes down to the empty hall, Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken      By the lonely Traveller’s call. And he felt in his heart their strangeness,      Their stillness answering his cry, While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,      ’Neath the starred and leafy sky; For he suddenly smote on the door, even      Louder, and lifted his head:— ‘Tell them I came, and no one answered,      That I kept my word,’ he said. Never the least stir made the listeners,      Though every word he spake Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house      From the one man left awake: Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,      And the sound of iron on stone, And how the silence surged softly backward,      When the plunging hoofs were gone.

Every morning the maple leaves.
                               Every morning another chapter where the hero shifts
            from one foot to the other. Every morning the same big
and little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out
                                             You will be alone always and then you will die.
So maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalog
         of non-definitive acts,
something other than the desperation.
                   Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I couldn’t come to your party.
Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I came to your party
         and seduced you
and left you bruised and ruined, you poor sad thing.
                                                         You want a better story. Who wouldn’t?
A forest, then. Beautiful trees. And a lady singing.
                  Love on the water, love underwater, love, love and so on.
What a sweet lady. Sing lady, sing! Of course, she wakes the dragon.
            Love always wakes the dragon and suddenly
                                                                                               flames everywhere.
I can tell already you think I’m the dragon,
                that would be so like me, but I’m not. I’m not the dragon.
I’m not the princess either.
                           Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.
I walk through your dreams and invent the future. Sure,
               I sink the boat of love, but that comes later. And yes, I swallow
         glass, but that comes later.
                                                            And the part where I push you
flush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks,
            shut up
I’m getting to it.
                                    For a while I thought I was the dragon.
I guess I can tell you that now. And, for a while, I thought I was
                                                                                                the princess,
cotton candy pink, sitting there in my room, in the tower of the castle,
          young and beautiful and in love and waiting for you with
confidence
            but the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess,
while I’m out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire,
                                                               and getting stabbed to death.
                                    Okay, so I’m the dragon. Big deal.
          You still get to be the hero.
You get magic gloves! A fish that talks! You get eyes like flashlights!
                  What more do you want?
I make you pancakes, I take you hunting, I talk to you as if you’re
            really there.
Are you there, sweetheart? Do you know me? Is this microphone live?
                                                       Let me do it right for once,
             for the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes,
you know the story, simply heaven.
                   Inside your head you hear a phone ringing
                                                               and when you open your eyes
only a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer.
                               Inside your head the sound of glass,
a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion.
             Hello darling, sorry about that.
                                                       Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we
lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell
                                    and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud.
            Especially that, but I should have known.
You see, I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together
            to make a creature that will do what I say
or love me back.
                  I’m not really sure why I do it, but in this version you are not
feeding yourself to a bad man
                                                   against a black sky prickled with small lights.
            I take it back.
The wooden halls like caskets. These terms from the lower depths.
                                                I take them back.
Here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed.
                                                                                               Crossed out.
            Clumsy hands in a dark room. Crossed out. There is something
underneath the floorboards.
                   Crossed out. And here is the tabernacle
                                                                                                reconstructed.
Here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all
               forgiven,
even though we didn’t deserve it.
                                                                    Inside your head you hear
a phone ringing, and when you open your eyes you’re washing up
            in a stranger’s bathroom,
standing by the window in a yellow towel, only twenty minutes away
                           from the dirtiest thing you know.
All the rooms of the castle except this one, says someone, and suddenly
                                                                                              darkness,
                                                                                     suddenly only darkness.
In the living room, in the broken yard,
                                  in the back of the car as the lights go by. In the airport
          bathroom’s gurgle and flush, bathed in a pharmacy of
unnatural light,
             my hands looking weird, my face weird, my feet too far away.
And then the airplane, the window seat over the wing with a view
                                                            of the wing and a little foil bag of peanuts.
I arrived in the city and you met me at the station,
          smiling in a way
                    that made me frightened. Down the alley, around the arcade,
          up the stairs of the building
to the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things,
                                                I looked out the window and said
                                This doesn’t look that much different from home,
            because it didn’t,
but then I noticed the black sky and all those lights.
                                           We walked through the house to the elevated train.
            All these buildings, all that glass and the shiny beautiful
                                                                                             mechanical wind.
We were inside the train car when I started to cry. You were crying too,
            smiling and crying in a way that made me
even more hysterical. You said I could have anything I wanted, but I
                                                                                      just couldn’t say it out loud.
Actually, you said Love, for you,
                                 is larger than the usual romantic love. It’s like a religion. It’s
                                                                                                 terrifying. No one
                                                                                 will ever want to sleep with you.

Little Boy Blue,
please cover your nose.
You sneezed on Miss Muffet
and ruined her clothes.
You sprayed Mother Hubbard,
and now she is sick.
You put out the fire   
on Jack’s candlestick.
Your sneeze is the reason   
why Humpty fell down.
You drenched Yankee Doodle
when he came to town.
The blind mice are angry!
The sheep are upset!
From now on use tissues
so no one gets wet!


^^EOP^^

Withouten you
No rose can grow;
No leaf be green
If never seen
Your sweetest face;
No bird have grace
Or power to sing;
Or anything
Be kind, or fair,
And you nowhere.

I buried my father
in the sky.
Since then, the birds
clean and comb him every morning   
and pull the blanket up to his chin   
every night. 
I buried my father underground.   
Since then, my ladders
only climb down,
and all the earth has become a house   
whose rooms are the hours, whose doors   
stand open at evening, receiving   
guest after guest.
Sometimes I see past them
to the tables spread for a wedding feast. 
I buried my father in my heart.
Now he grows in me, my strange son,   
my little root who won’t drink milk,   
little pale foot sunk in unheard-of night,   
little clock spring newly wet
in the fire, little grape, parent to the future   
wine, a son the fruit of his own son,   
little father I ransom with my life.

An apple paring
curled from the knife wetly
    down my thumb—
and what I had failed
to do rightly touching that life
    next to mine, wearing
late afternoon’s numb
luminosity, impaled me. 
    A hunter knee-deep
in salt marsh, whom Anton Chekov
might have set there and then left,
    back to doctoring,
or choked off as too dark, wanton,
    met the steep
flailing of teal, trailed their shrill lift,
but stood only, hearing them. 
    Pouring the last tea
of an evening, dark amber
alive, breathing in quintessence
    of India,
I felt limber bark
sheathing the shrub of my life’s tree
with root good, but dense,
dark, local, raw there, 
    and so in dark woke,
the seeing doctor, two simple
profiles of linked characters
    in his air, 
cruel, good, a pair ample, true
across that split yoke,
true to its splayed force—
simple so rare, though.

—Once more the poem woke me up,
the dark poem. I was ready for it;
he was sleeping,
         
and across the cabin, the small furnace
lit and re-lit itself—the flame a yellow
      “tongue” again, the metal benignly
hard again; 
and a thousand insects outside called
      and made me nothing;
moonlight streamed inside as if it had been ...
         
I looked around, I thought of the lower wisdom,
spirit held by matter:
      Mary, white as a sand dollar, 
and Christ, his sticky halo tilted—
      oh, to get behind it!
The world had been created to comprehend itself 
as matter: table, the torn
veils of spiders ... Even consciousness—
missing my love— 
was matter, the metal box of a furnace.
As the obligated flame, so burned my life ...
         
What is the meaning of this suffering I asked
and the voice—not Christ but between us—
said you are the meaning. 
No no, I replied, That
is the shape, what is the meaning.
You are the meaning, it said—

I know a little language of my cat, though Dante says   
that animals have no need of speech and Nature   
abhors the superfluous.   My cat is fluent.   He   
converses when he wants with me.   To speak 
is natural.   And whales and wolves I’ve heard   
in choral soundings of the sea and air
know harmony and have an eloquence that stirs   
my mind and heart—they touch the soul.   Here 
Dante’s religion that would set Man apart   
damns the effluence of our life from us   
to build therein its powerhouse. 
It’s in his animal communication Man is   
      true, immediate, and   
in immediacy, Man is all animal. 
His senses quicken in the thick of the symphony,
      old circuits of animal rapture and alarm,
attentions and arousals in which an identity rearrives.
      He hears
particular voices among
      the concert, the slightest   
rustle in the undertones,
      rehearsing a nervous aptitude   
yet to prove his. He sees the flick
      of significant red within the rushing mass
of ruddy wilderness and catches the glow
      of a green shirt
to delite him in a glowing field of green
      —it speaks to him—
and in the arc of the spectrum color   
      speaks to color.
The rainbow articulates
      a promise he remembers   
he but imitates
      in noises that he makes, 
this speech in every sense   
the world surrounding him.
He picks up on the fugitive tang of mace
      amidst the savory mass,
and taste in evolution is an everlasting key.
      There is a pun of scents in what makes sense. 
      Myrrh it may have been,
the odor of the announcement that filld the house. 
      He wakes from deepest sleep    
upon a distant signal and waits    
      as if crouching, springs 
      to life.

Spotlight a 
   SCENE ONE: Open-air court in the ancient city of Athens. The accused arrive
                      and proceed among curses and cries of Death! Death! 
   SCENE TWO: A jail in the same city, beneath the Acropolis, walls half-eaten by
                      dampness. On the ground, a miserly straw mat and in the corner,
                      an earthenware jar of water. On the outside wall, a shadow: the
                      guard. 
SCENE THREE: Constantinople. In the harem of the Holy Place, in candlelight,
                      the Queen throws a pouch of gold coins to the Head Eunuch
                      who bows and looks at her significantly. By the open door, his
                      men at the ready. 
   SCENE FOUR: Drawing room of a large Monastery. Oblong table, the abbot at
                      its head. Sweaty monks come and go bringing news: a crowd
                      spills into the streets, setting fires, destroying everything. 
   SCENE FIVE: Nauplio. Greek and Bavarian officers outside the King’s quarters
                      converse in low tones. A messenger takes the dispatch and heads
                      toward the steps that lead on high to Palamidi. 
    SCENE SIX: In front of an old and empty lot in contemporary Athens, a
                      crowd, motley with priests and bishops, gathers to cast a stone,
                      “the stone of anathema.” 
SCENE SEVEN: Low buildings of EAT/ESA. In the courtyard, drunken soldiers.
                      Braying and lewd posturing. The officer leaving some cell says
                      something to the military doctor. Behind them thuds and cries
                      are heard.

It was biting cold, and the falling snow, Which filled a poor little match girl’s heart with woe, Who was bareheaded and barefooted, as she went along the street, Crying, “Who’ll buy my matches? for I want pennies to buy some meat!”  When she left home she had slippers on; But, alas! poor child, now they were gone. For she lost both of them while hurrying across the street, Out of the way of two carriages which were near by her feet.  So the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and fast; And the child’s heart felt cold and downcast, For nobody had bought any matches that day, Which filled her little mind with grief and dismay.  Alas! she was hungry and shivering with cold; So in a corner between two houses she made bold To take shelter from the violent storm. Poor little waif! wishing to herself she’d never been born.  And she grew colder and colder, and feared to go home For fear of her father beating her; and she felt woe-begone Because she could carry home no pennies to buy bread, And to go home without pennies she was in dread.  The large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair hair; While the passers-by for her had no care, As they hurried along to their homes at a quick pace, While the cold wind blew in the match girl’s face.  As night wore on her hands were numb with cold, And no longer her strength could her uphold, When an idea into her little head came: She’d strike a match and warm her hands at the flame.  And she lighted the match, and it burned brightly, And it helped to fill her heart with glee; And she thought she was sitting at a stove very grand; But, alas! she was found dead, with a match in her hand!  Her body was found half-covered with snow, And as the people gazed thereon their hearts were full of woe; And many present let fall a burning tear Because she was found dead on the last night of the year,  In that mighty city of London, wherein is plenty of gold— But, alas! their charity towards street waifs is rather cold. But I hope the match girl’s in Heaven, beside her Saviour dear, A bright reward for all the hardships she suffered here.

The crowded street his playground is, a patch of blue his sky; A puddle in a vacant lot his sea where ships pass by: Poor little orphan boy of five, the city smoke and grime Taint every cooling breeze he gets throughout the summer time; And he is just as your boy is, a child who loves to play, Except that he is drawn and white and cannot get away.  And he would like the open fields, for often in his dreams The angels kind bear him off to where are pleasant streams, Where he may sail a splendid boat, sometimes he flies a kite, Or romps beside a shepherd dog and shouts with all his might; But when the dawn of morning comes he wakes to find once more That what he thought were sun-kissed hills are rags upon the floor.  Then through the hot and sultry day he plays at “make-pretend,” The alley is a sandy beach where all the rich folks send Their little boys and girls to play, a barrel is his boat, But, oh, the air is tifling and the dust fills up his throat; And though he tries so very hard to play, somehow it seems He never gets such wondrous joys as angels bring in dreams.  Poor little orphan boy of five, except that he is pale, With sunken cheeks and hollow eyes and very wan and frail, Just like that little boy of yours, with same desire to play, Fond of the open fields and skies, he’s built the self-same way; But kept by fate and circumstance away from shady streams, His only joy comes when he sleeps and angels bring him dreams.

A courtier speaks to Ch’in Shih-huang-ti, ca. 210 B.C.



Highness, the former walls were helpless. They
stood alone in the middle of small fields
protecting nothing. A single peasant’s holding
engulfed each one as it ran briefly, straight
from noplace off to noplace, with ruinous steps
of broken stone at both ends. Only head-high,
without the towers, gates and towns of your great wall,
they stuck where they were, never rising over hills
or curving through valleys: nothing but shoddy masonry
and a mystery: who built them, how long ago,
what for? They seemed to have no role but balking
the reaper and the ox; their bases made
islands in the flashing scythe-strokes, where wild flowers
and shrubs sprouted. 
                               So all the people praise you
for burying such walls and their memory
in your vast one, which joins them, stretching far
beyond where they once crumbled to hold your Empire:
a wall which therefore can never have an end
but has to go on extending itself forever.
How useful, how cogent your wall is: a pale
for the civilized, a dike against the wild people
outside, who trade their quiet human blood
for the rage of gods, tearing men to pieces,
throwing them, watching them fall. In burying
those little walls, Lord, you have covered our shame
at our ancestors, best forgotten, whose mighty works
were so pointless, or so pitiably useless.
Was all their effort so that daisies could grow in fissures?
So that some human work would rise over the flats
and weather till it seemed not human? Only
so that something of ours could be like trees and rocks:
docile-seeming, yet sullenly opposed
to use, and when compelled, only half serving,
reserving from the functions that we give them
a secret and idle self. The peasants would make
lean-tos for cattle against those walls: they served
for this alone. 
                        Now scholars, Lord, are saying
the gods are not bulls and cows. That in ancient times
we herded these animals to keep from starving
and going naked, and so came the old custom
of thinking them gods—from dependence. In my youth,
I know, the peasants said just the opposite.
Worship came first. The awesome bull and cow
were gathered to be adored more easily,
till people noticed how they let themselves
be driven and penned. Next came the first murders
against these gods, and the careful observation
that they stood to be killed. And so their cult became
contempt of beings that would live with us
and submit to our crimes and hunger, and we began
to breed them. That is why, the farmer says,
cattle are honoured, murdered, eaten, cherished
with labour that makes him their slave, and that is why
in summer he exults in blood, but shivers with fear,
with exhausted terror and regret, and sinks into
stunned revelry all winter, eating the salted meat,
getting children, his house closed up with snow,
himself awake as if he slept, living
as if he had already died, and rich, happy
as if he were a buried worm. 
                                           Is God,
then, Highness, the fat flaccidity of cattle?
Myself, I don’t like to wonder anymore.
I only hope lifelong service earns what I ask:
the command of some far bastion on your wall
where it curves out into the unsettled wastes
beyond any field, and the barrenness inside
is indistinguishable from that without.
This is the reward and end of life I want:
to be a point, though infinitely small
and far from you, in that wide circle centred
on your great self. I see myself arriving
to take charge of my troops. I look down from the tower:
bare plains, outcrops of ice and rock, vast restless
stirrings of grey grasses and dark-veined overcast,
the cold wind’s hissing. Year after year the same,
waiting for an assault that never comes,
straining to glimpse our naked enemies
creeping blended with their stony soil: nothing
but legend, it may be. Maybe a morning
will rise when, waking, I find that I’ve forgotten
which way is north, and can’t tell if I am turned
outward to danger or inward, Highness, to you.
The sun invisible, a murky light diffused
throughout featureless cloud, and the wall so long
no curve appears—it seems to stretch out straight
endlessly east and west: what clue will there be
which way to face my people for the attack?
It will be crucial then to show no doubt.
My orders, I vow, though ignorant, will be crisp.

Somebody’s baby was buried to-day—       The empty white hearse from the grave rumbled back, And the morning somehow seemed less smiling and gay       As I paused on the walk while it crossed on its way, And a shadow seemed drawn o’er the sun’s golden track.  Somebody’s baby was laid out to rest,       White as a snowdrop, and fair to behold, And the soft little hands were crossed over the breast,       And those hands and the lips and the eyelids were pressed With kisses as hot as the eyelids were cold.  Somebody saw it go out of her sight,       Under the coffin lid—out through the door; Somebody finds only darkness and blight       All through the glory of summer-sun light; Somebody’s baby will waken no more.  Somebody’s sorrow is making me weep:       I know not her name, but I echo her cry, For the dearly bought baby she longed so to keep,       The baby that rode to its long-lasting sleep In the little white hearse that went rumbling by.  I know not her name, but her sorrow I know;       While I paused on the crossing I lived it once more, And back to my heart surged that river of woe       That but in the breast of a mother can flow; For the little white hearse has been, too, at my door.

Before devising, your chicken you do not have to count.
As for the penny which is rescued it is the penny which is obtained.
The girl and the spice has become entirely from the splendid sugar.
The boy has consisted of the tail of the slug and the snail and the puppy.
As for the place of the woman there is a house.
One basket your egg everything does not have to be made.
The idiot hurries being about you fear because the angel steps on.
Your cake cannot do possessing and is eaten thing.
There is no wastefulness, unless so is, we want.
The safe which is better than regrettable.
Living, you have lived, permit.

I have two daughters. 
They are all I ever wanted from the earth. 
Or almost all. 
I also wanted one piece of ground: 
One city trapped by hills. One urban river.
An island in its element. 
So I could say mine. My own.
And mean it. 
Now they are grown up and far away 
and memory itself
has become an emigrant,
wandering in a place
where love dissembles itself as landscape: 
Where the hills
are the colours of a child's eyes,
where my children are distances, horizons: 
At night,
on the edge of sleep, 
I can see the shore of Dublin Bay.
Its rocky sweep and its granite pier. 
Is this, I say
how they must have seen it,
backing out on the mailboat at twilight, 
shadows falling
on everything they had to leave?
And would love forever?
And then 
I imagine myself
at the landward rail of that boat
searching for the last sight of a hand. 
I see myself
on the underworld side of that water,
the darkness coming in fast, saying
all the names I know for a lost land:  Ireland. Absence. Daughter.

All’s over, then: does truth sound bitter
  As one at first believes?Hark, ’tis the sparrows’ good-night twitter
  About your cottage eaves!
And the leaf-buds on the vine are woolly,
  I noticed that, today;One day more bursts them open fully
  – You know the red turns grey.
Tomorrow we meet the same then, dearest?
  May I take your hand in mine?Mere friends are we, – well, friends the merest
  Keep much that I resign:
For each glance of the eye so bright and black,
  Though I keep with heart’s endeavor, –Your voice, when you wish the snowdrops back,
  Though it stay in my soul for ever! –
Yet I will but say what mere friends say,
  Or only a thought stronger;I will hold your hand but as long as all may,
  Or so very little longer!

Who knows but that Meriwether Lewis’s   
lost diaries might turn up yet
packed in a can in some cramped ex-midden   
dug up a thousand years from now,   
that elegant, exfoliate style
continue on up the Missouri, into sadness
and disrepute, the suicide in a hotel in Tennessee   
no more important now than the bundle   
of grasses my friend made out in the woods   
yesterday and gave to me after a meeting   
in which she confessed she’s afraid of everything   
that’s coming. The past I don’t mind, she said,   
and laughed as if that was something.

Nudes—stark and glistening, Yelling in lurid glee. Grinning faces And raging limbs Whirl over the floor one fire. For a shirt verminously busy Yon soldier tore from his throat, with oaths Godhead might shrink at, but not the lice. And soon the shirt was aflare Over the candle he’d lit while we lay.  Then we all sprang up and stript To hunt the verminous brood. Soon like a demons’ pantomime The place was raging. See the silhouettes agape, See the gibbering shadows Mixed with the battled arms on the wall. See gargantuan hooked fingers Pluck in supreme flesh To smutch supreme littleness. See the merry limbs in hot Highland fling Because some wizard vermin Charmed from the quiet this revel When our ears were half lulled By the dark music Blown from Sleep’s trumpet.

We cannot live, except thus mutuallyWe alternate, aware or unaware,The reflex act of life: and when we bearOur virtue onward most impulsively,Most full of invocation, and to beMost instantly compellant, certes, thereWe live most life, whoever breathes most airAnd counts his dying years by sun and sea.But when a soul, by choice and conscience, dothThrow out her full force on another soul,The conscience and the concentration bothMake mere life, Love. For Life in perfect wholeAnd aim consummated, is Love in sooth,As nature’s magnet-heat rounds pole with pole.

Love again: wanking at ten past three   
(Surely he’s taken her home by now?),   
The bedroom hot as a bakery,
The drink gone dead, without showing how   
To meet tomorrow, and afterwards,
And the usual pain, like dysentery. 
Someone else feeling her breasts and cunt,   
Someone else drowned in that lash-wide stare,   
And me supposed to be ignorant,
Or find it funny, or not to care,
Even ... but why put it into words?
Isolate rather this element 
That spreads through other lives like a tree   
And sways them on in a sort of sense   
And say why it never worked for me.   
Something to do with violence
A long way back, and wrong rewards,   
And arrogant eternity.

1.  I watched thee when the foe was at our side,
 Ready to strike at him—or thee and me,Were safety hopeless—rather than divide 
 Aught with one loved save love and liberty.
  2.  I watched thee on the breakers, when the rock,
 Received our prow, and all was storm and fear,And bade thee cling to me through every shock;
 This arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier.
  3.  I watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes,
 Yielding my couch and stretched me on the groundWhen overworn with watching, ne’er to rise 
 From thence if thou an early grave hadst found.
  4.  The earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall,
 And men and nature reeled as if with wine. Whom did I seek around the tottering hall? 
 For thee. Whose safety first provide for? Thine.
  5.  And when convulsive throes denied my breath
 The faintest utterance to my fading thought, To thee—to thee—e’en in the gasp of death
 My spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought.
  6.  Thus much and more; and yet thou lov’st me not,
 And never wilt! Love dwells not in our will.Nor can I blame thee, though it be my lot 
 To strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still.

Love is like the wild rose-briar,Friendship like the holly-tree—The holly is dark when the rose-briar bloomsBut which will bloom most constantly?
The wild rose-briar is sweet in spring,Its summer blossoms scent the air;Yet wait till winter comes againAnd who will call the wild-briar fair?
Then scorn the silly rose-wreath nowAnd deck thee with the holly’s sheen,That when December blights thy browHe still may leave thy garland green.

All my past life is mine no more,
     The flying hours are gone,Like transitory dreams giv’n o’er,Whose images are kept in store
     By memory alone.
The time that is to come is not;
     How can it then be mine?The present moment’s all my lot;And that, as fast as it is got,
     Phyllis, is only thine.
Then talk not of inconstancy,
     False hearts, and broken vows;If I, by miracle, can beThis live-long minute true to thee,
     ’Tis all that Heav'n allows.

Lying asleep between the strokes of night     I saw my love lean over my sad bed,     Pale as the duskiest lily’s leaf or head, Smooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite, Too wan for blushing and too warm for white,     But perfect-coloured without white or red.     And her lips opened amorously, and said – I wist not what, saving one word – Delight.  And all her face was honey to my mouth,     And all her body pasture to mine eyes;          The long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire, The quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south,     The bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs          And glittering eyelids of my soul’s desire.

The eyes open to a cry of pulleys,
And spirited from sleep, the astounded soul   
Hangs for a moment bodiless and simple   
As false dawn.
                     Outside the open window   
The morning air is all awash with angels. 
    Some are in bed-sheets, some are in blouses,   
Some are in smocks: but truly there they are.   
Now they are rising together in calm swells   
Of halcyon feeling, filling whatever they wear   
With the deep joy of their impersonal breathing; 
    Now they are flying in place, conveying
The terrible speed of their omnipresence, moving   
And staying like white water; and now of a sudden   
They swoon down into so rapt a quiet
That nobody seems to be there.
                                             The soul shrinks 
    From all that it is about to remember,
From the punctual rape of every blessèd day,
And cries,
               “Oh, let there be nothing on earth but laundry,   
Nothing but rosy hands in the rising steam
And clear dances done in the sight of heaven.” 
    Yet, as the sun acknowledges
With a warm look the world’s hunks and colors,   
The soul descends once more in bitter love   
To accept the waking body, saying now
In a changed voice as the man yawns and rises,   
    “Bring them down from their ruddy gallows;
Let there be clean linen for the backs of thieves;   
Let lovers go fresh and sweet to be undone,   
And the heaviest nuns walk in a pure floating   
Of dark habits,
                      keeping their difficult balance.”

Let me cook you some dinner.   
Sit down and take off your shoes

turn on some music and dance   
around the house, inside and out,   
it’s night and the neighbors

the stars are shining bright,   
and I’ve got the burners lit

Guy calls the doctor, says the wife’s   
contractions are five minutes apart.   
Doctor says, Is this her first child?
guy says, No, it’s her husband. 
I promise to try to remember who   
I am. Wife gets up on one elbow, 
says, I wanted to get married.   
It seemed a fulfillment of some 
several things, a thing to be done.   
Even the diamond ring was some 
thing like a quest, a thing they   
set you out to get and how insane 
the quest is; how you have to turn   
it every way before you can even 
think to seek it; this metaphysical   
refraining is in fact the quest. Who’d 
have guessed? She sighs, I like   
the predictability of two, I like 
my pleasures fully expected,   
when the expectation of them 
grows patterned in its steady   
surprise. I’ve got my sweet 
and tumble pat. Here on earth,   
I like to count upon a thing 
like that. Thus explained   
the woman in contractions 
to her lover holding on
the telephone for the doctor 
to recover from this strange   
conversational turn. You say 
you’re whom? It is a pleasure   
to meet you. She rolls her 
eyes, but he’d once asked her    Am I your first lover? and she’d   
said, Could be. Your face looks   
familiar.

Love is a sickness full of woes,
 All remedies refusing;A plant that with most cutting grows,
 Most barren with best using.
   Why so?More we enjoy it, more it dies;If not enjoyed, it sighting cries,
   Heigh ho!
Love is a torment of the mind,
 A tempest everlasting;And Jove hath made it of a kind
 Not well, not full, nor fasting.
   Why so?More we enjoy it, more it dies;If not enjoyed, it sighing cries,
   Heigh ho!

                    Dear Miss,
First of all I want to say that I have enjoyed the imaginary possibility, built of course on the fact that such possibility does exist in nature: I have seen the birds and other forms of nonhumanity occur in such postures that must be with men and women....I have imagined myself in such postures with you, where flight was discouraged only by the inherent possibility of the firm horizontal...
         As men give vast lands to little papers with line and color, I have imagined more on the surface of your body, giving all the universe in this model....
         Yet, I must be curious about your breasts...curious...hungry is the word, to see, to touch, to taste....I am curious as to how your hands undress your body.
         I am interested in your mind: will you undress in front of me? Will you permit me the unparalleled pleasure of taking your clothes off?
         I feel that if I should have my penis in your vagina I should have your love; for you do not receive the wretched hardness of my desire into the sweet body of yourself without that you have not come to love me for reasons, if love has reasons, I cannot tell....

         Your admirer

for B. H.



I didn’t fall in love. I fell through it: 
Came out the other side moments later, hands full of matter, waking up from the dream of a bullet tearing through the middle of my body. 
I no longer understand anything for longer than a long moment, or the time it takes to receive the shot. 
This kind of gravity is like falling through a cloud, forgetting it all, and then being told about it later. On the day you fell through a cloud . . . 
It must be true. If it were not, then when did these strands of silver netting attach to my hair? 
The problem was finding that you were real and not just a dream of clouds. 
If you weren’t real, I would address this letter to one of two entities: myself, or everyone else. The effect would be equivalent. 
The act of falling happens in time. That is, it takes long enough for the falling to shear away from the moments before and the moments after, long enough for one to have thought I am falling. I have been falling. I continue to fall. 
Falling through a ring, in this case, would not mean falling through the center of the annulus—a planet floats there. Falling through the ring means falling through the spaces between the objects that together make the ring. 
On the way through, clasp your fists around the universe: 
Nothing but ice-gravel. 
But open your hands when you reach the other side. Quickly, before it melts.    
What did I leave you?

I would give my husband drawings for grocery lists,
with smiling faces on the eggs, and spider feet
dangling everywhere. I could draw letters too.
fat senseless alphabets, lexical landscapes of
pointed trees and bloated clouds. that is how I
wished words were, with changing colours and
feathers in their spines. on road signs in my
dreams, they shimmied, their Rockette heels a
variegated sunburst. unlike the stiff black
knots and stakes that glared at me from envelopes
and books. an unchanging and cruel exotica,
like smelling Cuban cigars wherever you go or
the same screaming opera. he said that I did
not need to learn with him there, reading slowly
aloud, but sometimes in silence. that drove me
insane, he would laugh or frown at something
on the page, and look as if he were a creeping
vine on a tombstone, a coffee stain on a piece
of clean manilla. I practice learning on a stack
of mail he kept in his sock drawer, and I
finally learned dear. Dear Hank, it felt like
having a perfume sample fall from a magazine
in a sweet sudden breath. it made me think of
velvet antlers, of his rumpled cardigan sweater
and my love for him, a word which slayed me,
with its clean lines and quick exhalation,
the swelling heart in its middle. I began to
scream things all day long, and I felt the first
affection for poetry through the ringing sounds
of advertisements, soapbox labels and advice to
the lovelorn columns. words were heroic, huge
killing things, and they beat in my head and
bled from my eyes and fingers. I would be ironing,
and a giant phrase or comma would barrel into
the room, its veins bulging, its arms around
my waist. Dear Hank, I miss you especially
your sexy hands, mine clenched when I got that
far and then some. then I knew for sure that
reading was magic, it conjured up these long
eyelashes and white Harlow hair, and the guilty
baldspot and shaking dewlap of my faithless
husband, adrift on the libretto of his private
life. he would still read to me in his annoying
way while I squirmed on my novels and texts,
that lay under the couch cushions like misplaced
scissors. I drew him an elaborate list one day,
of pink champagne bottles and support girdles,
and wrote my first words. I left them with his
letters, on the back of our marriage certificate,
I think they were my finest, I said, Dear
Hank, the end. and right away began working on
a longer book.

When I stood behind his desk chair   
and when he sat, on rare occasions,   
on the porch, “sage of Anacostia,”   
they called him, I smelled his mane   
glorious, and as a hand saddle
the aroma of hair took me to neckline   
and below. In Egypt, long after   
Napoleon had shot off the face   
of the Sphinx, I thought of this   
man, and the cusp of his palms   
on my shoulder blades;
as always he was carrying the mail   
of gender, his touch immaculate   
in the true blend of the cortex,
and of the complex, risen on a pulpit,   
and after the hot air, wintry parlance,   
the syllables of my name in his ear,   
when he touched me, as he had touched   
me then.
            I had my suspicions of English   
ladies, actresses, ghosts of the Thames,   
concubines, as we had been into this next   
century. And they had their wiles with him. 
I do not feel forbidden; the cameo ring   
he gave me, recession of his maleness   
all I need, and highlights of my dark   
profile, any children we might have   
had buried in architecture,
and the hate of his daughter Rosetta,   
who I have spoken to over the grate. 
The sun rises and sets in our neighborhood:
I WILL BURN THESE. But when I place my fingers
in that mane it is to the saddle he will come.

Love lives beyond The tomb, the earth, which fades like dew—                I love the fond, The faithful, and the true                 Love lives in sleep, 'Tis happiness of healthy dreams                Eve’s dews may weep, But love delightful seems.                 'Tis seen in flowers, And in the even's pearly dew                On earth's green hours, And in the heaven's eternal blue.                 ‘Tis heard in spring When light and sunbeams, warm and kind,                On angels’ wing Bring love and music to the wind.

Love me little, love me long, Is the burden of my song. Love that is too hot and strong     Burneth soon to waste: Still, I would not have thee cold, Not too backward, nor too bold; Love that lasteth till ’tis old     Fadeth not in haste.          Love me little, love me long,          Is the burden of my song.  If thou lovest me too much It will not prove as true as touch; Love me little, more than such,     For I fear the end: I am with little well content, And a little from thee sent Is enough, with true intent     To be steadfast friend.        Love me little, love me long,        Is the burden of my song.  Say thou lov’st me while thou live; I to thee my love will give, never dreaming to deceive     Whiles that life endures: Nay, and after death, in sooth, I too thee will keep my truth, As now, when in my May of youth:     This my love assures.        Love me little, love me long,        Is the burden on my song.  Constant love is moderate ever, And it will through life persèver: Give me that, with true endeavour     I will it restore. A suit of durance let it be For all weathers that for me, For the land or for the sea,     Lasting evermore.        Love me little, love me long,        Is the burden of my song.  Winter’s cold, or summer’s heat, Autumn’s tempests, on it beat, It can never know defeat,     Never can rebel: Such the love that I would gain, Such the love, I tell thee plain, Thou must give, or woo in vain:     So to thee, farewell        Love me little, love me long,        Is the burden of my song.

I follow with my mouth the small wing of muscle   
under your shoulder, lean over your back, breathing   
into your hair and thinking of nothing. I want
to lie down with you under the sails of a wooden sloop   
and drift away from all of it, our two cars rusting
in the parking lot, our families whining like tame geese   
at feeding time, and all the bosses of the earth   
cursing the traffic in the morning haze. 
They will telephone each other from their sofas   
and glass desks, with no idea where we could be,   
unable to picture the dark throat
of the saxophone playing upriver, or the fire
we gather between us on this fantail of dusty light,   
having stolen a truckload of roses
and thrown them into the sea.

Pack, clouds away! and welcome day!
  With night we banish sorrow;Sweet air, blow soft, mount larks aloft
  To give my love good-morrow!Wings from the wind to please her mind,
  Notes from the lark I’ll borrow;Bird, prune thy wing, nightingale, sing,
  To give my love good-morrow;
  To give my love good-morrow;
  Notes from them both I’ll borrow.
Wake from thy nest, Robin Redbreast, 
  Sing birds in every furrow;And from each hill, let music shrill
  Give my fair love good-morrow!Blackbird and thrush in every bush,
  Stare, linnet, and cock-sparrow!You pretty elves, amongst yourselves,
  Sing my fair love good-morrow;
  To give my love good-morrow,
  Sing birds in every furrow.

I scarce believe my love to be so pure    As I had thought it was,    Because it doth endure Vicissitude, and season, as the grass; Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore My love was infinite, if spring make’ it more.  But if medicine, love, which cures all sorrow With more, not only be no quintessence, But mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense, And of the sun his working vigor borrow, Love’s not so pure, and abstract, as they use To say, which have no mistress but their muse, But as all else, being elemented too, Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do.  And yet no greater, but more eminent,    Love by the spring is grown;    As, in the firmament, Stars by the sun are not enlarged, but shown, Gentle love deeds, as blossoms on a bough, From love’s awakened root do bud out now.  If, as water stirred more circles be Produced by one, love such additions take, Those, like so many spheres, but one heaven make, For they are all concentric unto thee; And though each spring do add to love new heat, As princes do in time of action get New taxes, and remit them not in peace, No winter shall abate the spring’s increase.

The fountains mingle with the river    And the rivers with the ocean, The winds of heaven mix for ever    With a sweet emotion; Nothing in the world is single;    All things by a law divine In one spirit meet and mingle.    Why not I with thine?—  See the mountains kiss high heaven    And the waves clasp one another; No sister-flower would be forgiven    If it disdained its brother; And the sunlight clasps the earth    And the moonbeams kiss the sea: What is all this sweet work worth    If thou kiss not me?

Slight unpremeditated Words are borne
  By every common Wind into the Air;Carelessly utter’d, die as soon as born,
  And in one instant give both Hope and Fear:Breathing all Contraries with the same WindAccording to the Caprice of the Mind.
But Billetdoux are constant Witnesses,
  Substantial Records to Eternity;Just Evidences, who the Truth confess,
  On which the Lover safely may rely;They’re serious Thoughts, digested and resolv’d;And last, when Words are into Clouds devolv’d.

My own dear love, he is strong and bold
      And he cares not what comes after.
His words ring sweet as a chime of gold,
      And his eyes are lit with laughter.
He is jubilant as a flag unfurled—
      Oh, a girl, she’d not forget him.
My own dear love, he is all my world,—
      And I wish I’d never met him. 
My love, he’s mad, and my love, he’s fleet,
      And a wild young wood-thing bore him!
The ways are fair to his roaming feet,
      And the skies are sunlit for him.
As sharply sweet to my heart he seems
      As the fragrance of acacia.
My own dear love, he is all my dreams,—
      And I wish he were in Asia. 
My love runs by like a day in June,
      And he makes no friends of sorrows.
He’ll tread his galloping rigadoon
      In the pathway of the morrows.
He’ll live his days where the sunbeams start,
      Nor could storm or wind uproot him.
My own dear love, he is all my heart,—
      And I wish somebody’d shoot him.

There is a strong wall about me to protect me: It is built of the words you have said to me.  There are swords about me to keep me safe: They are the kisses of your lips.  Before me goes a shield to guard me from harm: It is the shadow of your arms between me and danger.  All the wishes of my mind know your name, And the white desires of my heart They are acquainted with you. The cry of my body for completeness, That is a cry to you. My blood beats out your name to me,     unceasing, pitiless Your name, your name.

The south-wind strengthens to a gale,Across the moon the clouds fly fast,The house is smitten as with a flail,The chimney shudders to the blast.
On such a night, when Air has loosedIts guardian grasp on blood and brain,Old terrors then of god or ghostCreep from their caves to life again;
And Reason kens he herits inA haunted house. Tenants unknownAssert their squalid lease of sinWith earlier title than his own.
Unbodied presences, the pack’dPollution and remorse of Time,Slipp’d from oblivion reënactThe horrors of unhouseld crime.
Some men would quell the thing with prayerWhose sightless footsteps pad the floor,Whose fearful trespass mounts the stairOr burts the lock’d forbidden door.
Some have seen corpses long interr'dEscape from hallowing control,Pale charnel forms—nay ev’n have heardThe shrilling of a troubled soul,
That wanders till the dawn hath cross’dThe dolorous dark, or Earth hath woundCloser her storm-spredd cloke, and thrustThe baleful phantoms underground.

The flag is folded
lengthwise, and lengthwise again,
folding toward the open edge,
so that the union of stars on the blue
field remains outward in full view;
a triangular folding is then begun
at the striped end,
by bringing the corner of the folded edge
to the open edge;
the outer point, turned inward along the open edge,
forms the next triangular fold:
the folding continued so, until the end is reached,
the final corner tucked between
the folds of the blue union,
the form of the folded flag is found to resemble that
of a 3-cornered pouch, or thick cocked hat. 
Take this flag, John Glenn, instead of a friend;
instead of a brother, Edward Kennedy, take this flag;
instead of a father, Joe Kennedy, take this flag;
this flag instead of a husband, Ethel Kennedy, take this flag;
this 9-times-folded red-white-striped, star-spotted-blue flag,
tucked and pocketed neatly,
Nation, instead of a leader, take this folded flag.
Robert Kennedy, coffin without coverlet,
beside this hole in the grass,
beside your brother, John Kennedy,
in the grass,
take, instead of a country,
this folded flag;
Robert Kennedy, take this
hole in the grass.

Tired of his dark dominion ...
—George Meredith



It was something I’d overheard
One evening at a party; a man I liked enormously
                     Saying to a mutual friend, a woman
Wearing a vest embroidered with scarlet and violet tulips   
          That belled below each breast, “Well, I’ve always   
Preferred Athens; Greece seems to me a country
                     Of the day—Rome, I’m afraid, strikes me   
As being a city of the night ... ”
          Of course, I knew instantly just what he meant—   
                     Not simply because I love
Standing on the terrace of my apartment on a clear evening   
          As the constellations pulse low in the Roman sky,   
The whole mind of night that I know so well
                     Shimmering in its elaborate webs of infinite,
Almost divine irony. No, and it wasn’t only that Rome
          Was my city of the night, that it was here I’d chosen   
                     To live when I grew tired of my ancient life
As the Underground Man. And it wasn’t that Rome’s darkness   
                     Was of the kind that consoles so many
          Vacancies of the soul; my Rome, with its endless history   
Of falls ... No, it was that this dark was the deep, sensual dark
                     Of the dreamer; this dark was like the violet fur   
Spread to reveal the illuminated nipples of
                     The She-Wolf—all the sequins above in sequence,   
The white buds lost in those fields of ever-deepening gentians,
          A dark like the polished back of a mirror,
                     The pool of the night scalloped and hanging   
Above me, the inverted reflection of a last,
                                                                Odd Narcissus ... 
                                           One night my friend Nico came by   
Close to three a.m.—As we drank a little wine, I could see
                     The black of her pupils blown wide,   
The spread ripples of the opiate night ... And Nico
          Pulled herself close to me, her mouth almost
                     Touching my mouth, as she sighed, “Look ... ,”
And deep within the pupil of her left eye,
          Almost like the mirage of a ship’s distant, hanging
                     Lantern rocking with the waves,
I could see, at the most remote end of the receding,
          Circular hallway of her eye, there, at its doorway,   
At the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil,
                               A tiny, dangling crucifix—   
Silver, lit by the ragged shards of starlight, reflecting
          In her as quietly as pain, as simply as pain ...
Some years later, I saw Nico on stage in New York, singing
          Inside loosed sheets of shattered light, a fluid   
Kaleidoscope washing over her—the way any naked,
                     Emerging Venus steps up along the scalloped lip
          Of her shell, innocent and raw as fate, slowly   
Obscured by a florescence that reveals her simple, deadly
                               Love of sexual sincerity ...
          I didn’t bother to say hello. I decided to remember   
The way in Rome, out driving at night, she’d laugh as she let
          Her head fall back against the cracked, red leather
                               Of my old Lancia’s seats, the soft black wind   
Fanning her pale, chalky hair out along its currents,
          Ivory waves of starlight breaking above us in the leaves;   
The sad, lucent malevolence of the heavens, falling ...
                     Both of us racing silently as light. Nowhere,   
Then forever ...

Lucks, my fair falcon, and your fellows all,   How well pleasant it were your liberty!Ye not forsake me that fair might ye befall. But they that sometime liked my company: Like lice away from dead bodies they crawl. Lo what a proof in light adversity! But ye my birds, I swear by all your bells, Ye be my friends, and so be but few else.

Go to the western gate, Luke Havergal,
There where the vines cling crimson on the wall,
And in the twilight wait for what will come.
The leaves will whisper there of her, and some,
Like flying words, will strike you as they fall;
But go, and if you listen she will call.
Go to the western gate, Luke Havergal—
Luke Havergal. 
No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies
To rift the fiery night that’s in your eyes;
But there, where western glooms are gathering,
The dark will end the dark, if anything:
God slays Himself with every leaf that flies,
And hell is more than half of paradise.
No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies—
In eastern skies. 
Out of a grave I come to tell you this,
Out of a grave I come to quench the kiss
That flames upon your forehead with a glow
That blinds you to the way that you must go.
Yes, there is yet one way to where she is,
Bitter, but one that faith may never miss.
Out of a grave I come to tell you this—
To tell you this. 
There is the western gate, Luke Havergal,
There are the crimson leaves upon the wall.
Go, for the winds are tearing them away,—
Nor think to riddle the dead words they say,
Nor any more to feel them as they fall;
But go, and if you trust her she will call.
There is the western gate, Luke Havergal—
Luke Havergal.

Sleep little baby, clean as a nut,
Your fingers uncurl and your eyes are shut.
Your life was ours, which is with you.
Go on your journey. We go too. 
The bat is flying round the house
Like an umbrella turned into a mouse.
The moon is astonished and so are the sheep:
Their bells have come to send you to sleep. 
Oh be our rest, our hopeful start.
Turn your head to my beating heart.
Sleep little baby, clean as a nut,
Your fingers uncurl and your eyes are shut.

The kilted porter shook my hand in welcome,
drained it of blood and gave me back my luggage.
I signed the register in my own name
for the first time in my life of low celebrity.
In the lounge bar, there were pictures by Margarita
but no sign of margaritas by the pitcher.
All night, the couple in the next-door room
failed noisily to make love even once.
The signature tune of the air conditioning
was a surface B-side for any one-hit-wonder.
Weary, I ordered up the late night menu
from room service, but sleep wasn’t on it
so, after an hour of mentally undressing myself,
I donned the pyjamas with the killer bee motif
and there on the bed I wrote a dozen
identical postcards to friends I’d forgotten.
No doubt to keep the cold tap company,
the hot tap had opted to be a cold tap too.
Funnel-web spiders wove their lazy way
toward each other across the scarlet ceiling
and when I solved the riddle of the shower,
no blood came gushing, but no water either.
By the bed, a Gideon Bible in Esperanto
and a phone-book listing Lumsdens of the world;
in the mini-bar, flat Vimto and a half-pint
of someone else’s mother’s milk, turned to fur.
The TV had one channel, showing highlights
from my worst performances in every sphere.
At three, in the courtyard, a chambermaid choir
sang a barbershop version of ‘I Will Survive’.
The only time I dared to close my eyes,
dervishes under the bed began to talk dirty.
When I left at nine and settled my check,
they told me clearly Don't come back.

Inside my lunch
to my surprise
a perfect heart-shaped
love note lies. 
The outside says,
“Will you be mine?”
and, “Will you be
my valentine?” 
I take it out
and wonder who
would want to tell me
“I love you.” 
Perhaps a girl
who’s much too shy
to hand it to me
eye to eye. 
Or maybe it
was sweetly penned
in private by
a secret friend 
Who found my lunchbox
sitting by
and slid the note in
on the sly. 
Oh, I’d be thrilled
if it were Jo,
the cute one in
the second row. 
Or could it be
from Jennifer?
Has she found out
I’m sweet on her? 
My mind’s abuzz,
my shoulders tense.
I need no more
of this suspense. 
My stomach lurching
in my throat,
I open up
my little note. 
Then wham! as if
it were a bomb,
inside it reads,
“I love you—Mom.”

Lusty Youth should us ensue, His merry heart shall sure all rue. For whatsoever they do him tell, It is not for him, we know it well.  For they would have him his Liberty refrain And all merry company for to disdain, But I will not so whatsoever they say, But follow his mind in all that we may.  How should Youth himself best use But all disdainers for to refuse? Youth has, as chief assurance, Honest Mirth with Virtue's pastance.  For in them consisteth great honour, Though that disdainers would therein put error, For they do sue to get them grace All only riches to purchase.  With Good Order, Counsel, and Equity, Good Lord, grant us our mansion to be! For without their good guidance Youth should fall in great mischance.  For Youth is frail and prompt to do, As well vices as virtues to ensue. Wherefore by these he must be guided And Virtue's pastance must be therein used.  Now unto God this prayer we make, That this rude play may well be take, And that we may our faults amend, An bliss obtain at our last end.

Lying in bed I think about you,
your ugly empty airless apartment
and your eyes. It’s noon, and tired
I look into the rest of the awake day
incapable of even awe, just
a presence of particle and wave,
just that closed and deliberate
human observance. Your thin fingers
and the dissolution of all ability. Lay   
open now to only me that white body,
and I will, as the awkward butterfly,
land quietly upon you. A grace and
staying. A sight and ease. A spell
entangled. A span. I am inside you.
And so both projected, we are now
part of a garden, that is part of a   
landscape, that is part of a world
that no one believes in.

Before anything could happen,
flecks of real gold
on her mouth, her eyes more
convex than any others,
the ground spoke, the barrier
of lilacs spoke. What sang
in the black tree was entirely gold.
Her chair was empty. 
New absence is a great figure
dark as the underskin of fruit.
At the center of the earth
it surrounds and amplifies the dead
whose music never slows down. 
She came by car. I came by train.
We embraced. It was
at the foot of a hill steeply
crowned with apples
and a ruined fortress.
Imagination did not make the world. 
Sweetness is the entire portion.
Before anything could happen,
happiness, the necessary
precondition of the world,
spoke and flowered over the hill. 
When I was in Hell
on the ruined palisade,
either mystery or loneliness
kissed my open eyes. 
It felt hugely convex, seeing
and immediately forgetting. 
By contrast, what I imagined
later was nothing.

Love me little, love me long, Is the burden of my song. Love that is too hot and strong     Burneth soon to waste: Still, I would not have thee cold, Not too backward, nor too bold; Love that lasteth till ’tis old     Fadeth not in haste.          Love me little, love me long,          Is the burden of my song.  If thou lovest me too much It will not prove as true as touch; Love me little, more than such,     For I fear the end: I am with little well content, And a little from thee sent Is enough, with true intent     To be steadfast friend.        Love me little, love me long,        Is the burden of my song.  Say thou lov’st me while thou live; I to thee my love will give, never dreaming to deceive     Whiles that life endures: Nay, and after death, in sooth, I too thee will keep my truth, As now, when in my May of youth:     This my love assures.        Love me little, love me long,        Is the burden on my song.  Constant love is moderate ever, And it will through life persèver: Give me that, with true endeavour     I will it restore. A suit of durance let it be For all weathers that for me, For the land or for the sea,     Lasting evermore.        Love me little, love me long,        Is the burden of my song.  Winter’s cold, or summer’s heat, Autumn’s tempests, on it beat, It can never know defeat,     Never can rebel: Such the love that I would gain, Such the love, I tell thee plain, Thou must give, or woo in vain:     So to thee, farewell        Love me little, love me long,        Is the burden of my song.

I follow with my mouth the small wing of muscle   
under your shoulder, lean over your back, breathing   
into your hair and thinking of nothing. I want
to lie down with you under the sails of a wooden sloop   
and drift away from all of it, our two cars rusting
in the parking lot, our families whining like tame geese   
at feeding time, and all the bosses of the earth   
cursing the traffic in the morning haze. 
They will telephone each other from their sofas   
and glass desks, with no idea where we could be,   
unable to picture the dark throat
of the saxophone playing upriver, or the fire
we gather between us on this fantail of dusty light,   
having stolen a truckload of roses
and thrown them into the sea.

Pack, clouds away! and welcome day!
  With night we banish sorrow;Sweet air, blow soft, mount larks aloft
  To give my love good-morrow!Wings from the wind to please her mind,
  Notes from the lark I’ll borrow;Bird, prune thy wing, nightingale, sing,
  To give my love good-morrow;
  To give my love good-morrow;
  Notes from them both I’ll borrow.
Wake from thy nest, Robin Redbreast, 
  Sing birds in every furrow;And from each hill, let music shrill
  Give my fair love good-morrow!Blackbird and thrush in every bush,
  Stare, linnet, and cock-sparrow!You pretty elves, amongst yourselves,
  Sing my fair love good-morrow;
  To give my love good-morrow,
  Sing birds in every furrow.

I scarce believe my love to be so pure    As I had thought it was,    Because it doth endure Vicissitude, and season, as the grass; Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore My love was infinite, if spring make’ it more.  But if medicine, love, which cures all sorrow With more, not only be no quintessence, But mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense, And of the sun his working vigor borrow, Love’s not so pure, and abstract, as they use To say, which have no mistress but their muse, But as all else, being elemented too, Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do.  And yet no greater, but more eminent,    Love by the spring is grown;    As, in the firmament, Stars by the sun are not enlarged, but shown, Gentle love deeds, as blossoms on a bough, From love’s awakened root do bud out now.  If, as water stirred more circles be Produced by one, love such additions take, Those, like so many spheres, but one heaven make, For they are all concentric unto thee; And though each spring do add to love new heat, As princes do in time of action get New taxes, and remit them not in peace, No winter shall abate the spring’s increase.

The fountains mingle with the river    And the rivers with the ocean, The winds of heaven mix for ever    With a sweet emotion; Nothing in the world is single;    All things by a law divine In one spirit meet and mingle.    Why not I with thine?—  See the mountains kiss high heaven    And the waves clasp one another; No sister-flower would be forgiven    If it disdained its brother; And the sunlight clasps the earth    And the moonbeams kiss the sea: What is all this sweet work worth    If thou kiss not me?

Slight unpremeditated Words are borne
  By every common Wind into the Air;Carelessly utter’d, die as soon as born,
  And in one instant give both Hope and Fear:Breathing all Contraries with the same WindAccording to the Caprice of the Mind.
But Billetdoux are constant Witnesses,
  Substantial Records to Eternity;Just Evidences, who the Truth confess,
  On which the Lover safely may rely;They’re serious Thoughts, digested and resolv’d;And last, when Words are into Clouds devolv’d.

My own dear love, he is strong and bold
      And he cares not what comes after.
His words ring sweet as a chime of gold,
      And his eyes are lit with laughter.
He is jubilant as a flag unfurled—
      Oh, a girl, she’d not forget him.
My own dear love, he is all my world,—
      And I wish I’d never met him. 
My love, he’s mad, and my love, he’s fleet,
      And a wild young wood-thing bore him!
The ways are fair to his roaming feet,
      And the skies are sunlit for him.
As sharply sweet to my heart he seems
      As the fragrance of acacia.
My own dear love, he is all my dreams,—
      And I wish he were in Asia. 
My love runs by like a day in June,
      And he makes no friends of sorrows.
He’ll tread his galloping rigadoon
      In the pathway of the morrows.
He’ll live his days where the sunbeams start,
      Nor could storm or wind uproot him.
My own dear love, he is all my heart,—
      And I wish somebody’d shoot him.

There is a strong wall about me to protect me: It is built of the words you have said to me.  There are swords about me to keep me safe: They are the kisses of your lips.  Before me goes a shield to guard me from harm: It is the shadow of your arms between me and danger.  All the wishes of my mind know your name, And the white desires of my heart They are acquainted with you. The cry of my body for completeness, That is a cry to you. My blood beats out your name to me,     unceasing, pitiless Your name, your name.

The south-wind strengthens to a gale,Across the moon the clouds fly fast,The house is smitten as with a flail,The chimney shudders to the blast.
On such a night, when Air has loosedIts guardian grasp on blood and brain,Old terrors then of god or ghostCreep from their caves to life again;
And Reason kens he herits inA haunted house. Tenants unknownAssert their squalid lease of sinWith earlier title than his own.
Unbodied presences, the pack’dPollution and remorse of Time,Slipp’d from oblivion reënactThe horrors of unhouseld crime.
Some men would quell the thing with prayerWhose sightless footsteps pad the floor,Whose fearful trespass mounts the stairOr burts the lock’d forbidden door.
Some have seen corpses long interr'dEscape from hallowing control,Pale charnel forms—nay ev’n have heardThe shrilling of a troubled soul,
That wanders till the dawn hath cross’dThe dolorous dark, or Earth hath woundCloser her storm-spredd cloke, and thrustThe baleful phantoms underground.

The flag is folded
lengthwise, and lengthwise again,
folding toward the open edge,
so that the union of stars on the blue
field remains outward in full view;
a triangular folding is then begun
at the striped end,
by bringing the corner of the folded edge
to the open edge;
the outer point, turned inward along the open edge,
forms the next triangular fold:
the folding continued so, until the end is reached,
the final corner tucked between
the folds of the blue union,
the form of the folded flag is found to resemble that
of a 3-cornered pouch, or thick cocked hat. 
Take this flag, John Glenn, instead of a friend;
instead of a brother, Edward Kennedy, take this flag;
instead of a father, Joe Kennedy, take this flag;
this flag instead of a husband, Ethel Kennedy, take this flag;
this 9-times-folded red-white-striped, star-spotted-blue flag,
tucked and pocketed neatly,
Nation, instead of a leader, take this folded flag.
Robert Kennedy, coffin without coverlet,
beside this hole in the grass,
beside your brother, John Kennedy,
in the grass,
take, instead of a country,
this folded flag;
Robert Kennedy, take this
hole in the grass.

Tired of his dark dominion ...
—George Meredith



It was something I’d overheard
One evening at a party; a man I liked enormously
                     Saying to a mutual friend, a woman
Wearing a vest embroidered with scarlet and violet tulips   
          That belled below each breast, “Well, I’ve always   
Preferred Athens; Greece seems to me a country
                     Of the day—Rome, I’m afraid, strikes me   
As being a city of the night ... ”
          Of course, I knew instantly just what he meant—   
                     Not simply because I love
Standing on the terrace of my apartment on a clear evening   
          As the constellations pulse low in the Roman sky,   
The whole mind of night that I know so well
                     Shimmering in its elaborate webs of infinite,
Almost divine irony. No, and it wasn’t only that Rome
          Was my city of the night, that it was here I’d chosen   
                     To live when I grew tired of my ancient life
As the Underground Man. And it wasn’t that Rome’s darkness   
                     Was of the kind that consoles so many
          Vacancies of the soul; my Rome, with its endless history   
Of falls ... No, it was that this dark was the deep, sensual dark
                     Of the dreamer; this dark was like the violet fur   
Spread to reveal the illuminated nipples of
                     The She-Wolf—all the sequins above in sequence,   
The white buds lost in those fields of ever-deepening gentians,
          A dark like the polished back of a mirror,
                     The pool of the night scalloped and hanging   
Above me, the inverted reflection of a last,
                                                                Odd Narcissus ... 
                                           One night my friend Nico came by   
Close to three a.m.—As we drank a little wine, I could see
                     The black of her pupils blown wide,   
The spread ripples of the opiate night ... And Nico
          Pulled herself close to me, her mouth almost
                     Touching my mouth, as she sighed, “Look ... ,”
And deep within the pupil of her left eye,
          Almost like the mirage of a ship’s distant, hanging
                     Lantern rocking with the waves,
I could see, at the most remote end of the receding,
          Circular hallway of her eye, there, at its doorway,   
At the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil,
                               A tiny, dangling crucifix—   
Silver, lit by the ragged shards of starlight, reflecting
          In her as quietly as pain, as simply as pain ...
Some years later, I saw Nico on stage in New York, singing
          Inside loosed sheets of shattered light, a fluid   
Kaleidoscope washing over her—the way any naked,
                     Emerging Venus steps up along the scalloped lip
          Of her shell, innocent and raw as fate, slowly   
Obscured by a florescence that reveals her simple, deadly
                               Love of sexual sincerity ...
          I didn’t bother to say hello. I decided to remember   
The way in Rome, out driving at night, she’d laugh as she let
          Her head fall back against the cracked, red leather
                               Of my old Lancia’s seats, the soft black wind   
Fanning her pale, chalky hair out along its currents,
          Ivory waves of starlight breaking above us in the leaves;   
The sad, lucent malevolence of the heavens, falling ...
                     Both of us racing silently as light. Nowhere,   
Then forever ...
                                           Into the mind of the Roman night.

and a ruined fortress.
Imagination did not make the world. 
Sweetness is the entire portion.
Before anything could happen,
happiness, the necessary
precondition of the world,
spoke and flowered over the hill. 
When I was in Hell
on the ruined palisade,
either mystery or loneliness
kissed my open eyes. 
It felt hugely convex, seeing
and immediately forgetting. 
By contrast, what I imagined
later was nothing.

In a drawer I found a map of the world,
folded into eighths and then once again
and each country bore the wrong name because
the map of the world is an orphanage. 
The edges of the earth had a margin
as frayed as the hem of the falling night
and a crease moved down toward the center of
the earth, halving the identical stars. 
Every river ran with its thin blue
brother out from the heart of a country:
there cedars twisted toward the southern sky
and reeds plumed eastward like an augur’s pens. 
No dates on the wrinkles of that broad face,
no slow grinding of mountains and sand, for—
all at once, like a knife on a whetstone—
the map of the world spoke in snakes and tongues. 
The hard-topped roads of the western suburbs
and the distant lights of the capitol
each pull away from the yellowed beaches
and step into the lost sea of daybreak. 
The map of the world is a canvas turning
away from the painter’s ink-stained hands
while the pigments cake in their little glass
jars and the brushes grow stiff with forgetting. 
There is no model, shy and half-undressed,
no open window and flickering lamp,
yet someone has left this sealed blue letter,
this gypsy’s bandana on the darkening 
Table, each corner held down by a conch
shell. What does the body remember at
dusk? That the palms of the hands are a map
of the world, erased and drawn again and 
Again, then covered with rivers and earth.

for Desiray Kierra Chee



In the last days of the fourth world I wished to make a map for
those who would climb through the hole in the sky. 
My only tools were the desires of humans as they emerged
from the killing fields, from the bedrooms and the kitchens. 
For the soul is a wanderer with many hands and feet. 
The map must be of sand and can’t be read by ordinary light. It
must carry fire to the next tribal town, for renewal of spirit. 
In the legend are instructions on the language of the land, how it
was we forgot to acknowledge the gift, as if we were not in it or of it. 
Take note of the proliferation of supermarkets and malls, the
altars of money. They best describe the detour from grace. 
Keep track of the errors of our forgetfulness; the fog steals our
children while we sleep. 
Flowers of rage spring up in the depression. Monsters are born
there of nuclear anger. 
Trees of ashes wave good-bye to good-bye and the map appears to
disappear. 
We no longer know the names of the birds here, how to speak to
them by their personal names. 
Once we knew everything in this lush promise. 
What I am telling you is real and is printed in a warning on the
map. Our forgetfulness stalks us, walks the earth behind us, leav-
ing a trail of paper diapers, needles, and wasted blood. 
An imperfect map will have to do, little one. 
The place of entry is the sea of your mother’s blood, your father’s
small death as he longs to know himself in another. 
There is no exit. 
The map can be interpreted through the wall of the intestine—a
spiral on the road of knowledge. 
You will travel through the membrane of death, smell cooking
from the encampment where our relatives make a feast of fresh
deer meat and corn soup, in the Milky Way. 
They have never left us; we abandoned them for science. 
And when you take your next breath as we enter the fifth world
there will be no X, no guidebook with words you can carry. 
You will have to navigate by your mother’s voice, renew the song
she is singing. 
Fresh courage glimmers from planets. 
And lights the map printed with the blood of history, a map you
will have to know by your intention, by the language of suns. 
When you emerge note the tracks of the monster slayers where they
entered the cities of artificial light and killed what was killing us. 
You will see red cliffs. They are the heart, contain the ladder. 
A white deer will greet you when the last human climbs from the
destruction. 
Remember the hole of shame marking the act of abandoning our
tribal grounds. 
We were never perfect. 
Yet, the journey we make together is perfect on this earth who was
once a star and made the same mistakes as humans. 
We might make them again, she said. 
Crucial to finding the way is this: there is no beginning or end. 
You must make your own map.

August, goldenrod blowing. We walk
into the graveyard, to find
my grandfather’s grave. Ten years ago
I came here last, bringing
marigolds from the round garden
outside the kitchen.
I didn’t know you then.
                                  We walk
among carved names that go with photographs
on top of the piano at the farm:
Keneston, Wells, Fowler, Batchelder, Buck.
We pause at the new grave
of Grace Fenton, my grandfather’s
sister. Last summer
we called on her at the nursing home,
eighty-seven, and nodding
in a blue housedress. We cannot find
my grandfather’s grave.
                                  Back at the house
where no one lives, we potter
and explore the back chamber
where everything comes to rest: spinning wheels,
pretty boxes, quilts,
bottles, books, albums of postcards.
Then with a flashlight we descend
firm steps to the root cellar—black,
cobwebby, huge,
with dirt floors and fieldstone walls,
and above the walls, holding the hewn
sills of the house, enormous
granite foundation stones.
Past the empty bins
for squash, apples, carrots, and potatoes,
we discover the shelves for canning, a few
pale pints
of tomato left, and—what
is this?—syrup, maple syrup
in a quart jar, syrup
my grandfather made twenty-five
years ago
for the last time.
                           I remember
coming to the farm in March
in sugaring time, as a small boy.
He carried the pails of sap, sixteen-quart
buckets, dangling from each end
of a wooden yoke
that lay across his shoulders, and emptied them
into a vat in the saphouse
where fire burned day and night
for a week.
                Now the saphouse
tilts, nearly to the ground,
like someone exhausted
to the point of death, and next winter
when snow piles three feet thick
on the roofs of the cold farm,
the saphouse will shudder and slide
with the snow to the ground.
                                          Today
we take my grandfather’s last
quart of syrup
upstairs, holding it gingerly,
and we wash off twenty-five years
of dirt, and we pull
and pry the lid up, cutting the stiff,
dried rubber gasket, and dip our fingers
in, you and I both, and taste
the sweetness, you for the first time,
the sweetness preserved, of a dead man
in the kitchen he left
when his body slid
like anyone’s into the ground.

Did all the lets and bars appear       To every just or larger end, Whence should come the trust and cheer?       Youth must its ignorant impulse lend— Age finds place in the rear.       All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys, The champions and enthusiasts of the state:       Turbid ardors and vain joys             Not barrenly abate— Stimulants to the power mature,       Preparatives of fate.  Who here forecasteth the event? What heart but spurns at precedent And warnings of the wise, Contemned foreclosures of surprise? The banners play, the bugles call, The air is blue and prodigal.       No berrying party, pleasure-wooed, No picnic party in the May, Ever went less loth than they       Into that leafy neighborhood. In Bacchic glee they file toward Fate, Moloch’s uninitiate; Expectancy, and glad surmise Of battle’s unknown mysteries.  All they feel is this: ’tis glory, A rapture sharp, though transitory, Yet lasting in belaureled story. So they gayly go to fight, Chatting left and laughing right.  But some who this blithe mood present,       As on in lightsome files they fare, Shall die experienced ere three days be spent—       Perish, enlightened by the vollied glare; Or shame survive, and, like to adamant,       Thy after shock, Manassas, share.

I’m a frogman. Naked by the water
Under a lean of canvas she’d sewn
With a thick paraffin thread,
She gestured. When we pulled him
From the river
His left leg was meal. Crayfish in the hair.
The river bottom left his shoulder
Layered and crocheted—
My sister’s pearl knitting needles
Clicking in my head. I told
The sheriff I wouldn’t do it again. 
I knew him once. His Chevy threw a rod.
I made it with him
On the hood of the old truck.
It was out at the dump beyond Yuma.
It felt like I had bread crumbs
All over my mouth. Wacky with the sun,
I sure did it with him enough
That afternoon. I didn’t 
Know it was him who’d drowned.
They said it was his cousin.
He had a three-cornered scar
At the small of his back. And a deposit
Of calcium on the tailbone.
We’re not much, you know? 
He was tangled in yellow tree roots,
He spun in the currents,
A fishhook and line running
From his thumb.
A whole new ball of wax, I thought. 
I wanted to be an astronaut.
But failed the mathematics
Twice in one summer.
So I raise Nubian goats.
My favorite has a purple manure
That comes out like steaming packets
Of tobacco mulch. He sprays
The shack with his seed—
It hasn’t needed paint in three years. 
I just took my shorts off
When you two came down the hill.
It’s that rubber suit I wear
When I dive into the chute and cave.
Sometimes I just feel
Like old air in a patched tire. Then,
I get my Seagram’s and come out here.
You two look married. Not that I care.
You wouldn’t believe what I was just thinking—
Your husband’s the only living man
Left in this country
Who knows that I bleach my hair.

My mind is like a clamorous market-place.    All day in wind, rain, sun, its babel wells;    Voice answering to voice in tumult swells.   Chaffering and laughing, pushing for a place, My thoughts haste on, gay, strange, poor, simple, base;    This one buys dust, and that a bauble sells:    But none to any scrutiny hints or tells The haunting secrets hidden in each sad face.  The clamour quietens when the dark draws near;    Strange looms the earth in twilight of the West,   Lonely with one sweet star serene and clear,    Dwelling, when all this place is hushed to rest,    On vacant stall, gold, refuse, worst and best,   Abandoned utterly in haste and fear.

APPLES           Come buy my fine wares,          Plums, apples and pears.          A hundred a penny,          In conscience too many:          Come, will you have any?          My children are seven,          I wish them in Heaven;          My husband’s a sot,          With his pipe and his pot,          Not a farthen will gain them,          And I must maintain them.                             ONIONS           Come, follow me by the smell,          Here are delicate onions to sell;          I promise to use you well.          They make the blood warmer,          You’ll feed like a farmer; For this is every cook’s opinion, No savoury dish without an onion; But, lest your kissing should be spoiled, Your onions must be thoroughly boiled:          Or else you may spare          Your mistress a share, The secret will never be known:          She cannot discover          The breath of her lover, But think it as sweet as her own.                             HERRINGS           Be not sparing,          Leave off swearing.          Buy my herring          Fresh from Malahide,          Better never was tried. Come, eat them with pure fresh butter and mustard, Their bellies are soft, and as white as a custard. Come, sixpence a dozen, to get me some bread, Or, like my own herrings, I soon shall be dead.

Years later they find themselves talking   
about chances, moments when their lives   
might have swerved off
for the smallest reason.
                                     What if
I hadn’t phoned, he says, that morning?   
What if you’d been out,
as you were when I tried three times   
the night before?
                           Then she tells him a secret.   
She’d been there all evening, and she knew   
he was the one calling, which was why   
she hadn’t answered.
                               Because she felt—
because she was certain—her life would change   
if she picked up the phone, said hello,   
said, I was just thinking
of you.
            I was afraid,
she tells him. And in the morning   
I also knew it was you, but I just   
answered the phone
                            the way anyone
answers a phone when it starts to ring,   
not thinking you have a choice.


^^EOP^^

No more alone sleeping, no more alone waking,
 Thy dreams divided, thy prayers in twain;Thy merry sisters tonight forsaking,
 Never shall we see, maiden, again.
Never shall we see thee, thine eyes glancing.
 Flashing with laughter and wild in glee,Under the mistletoe kissing and dancing,
 Wantonly free.
There shall come a matron walking sedately,
  Low-voiced, gentle, wise in reply.Tell me, O tell me, can I love her greatly?
 All for her sake must the maiden die!


^^EOP^^

The first retainer   
he gave to her   
was a golden
wedding ring. 
The second—late at night   
he woke up,
leaned over on an elbow,   
and kissed her. 
The third and the last—
he died with
and gave up loving
and lived with her.

When the wind was right everything else
was wrong, like the oak we thought built
better than the house split like a ship
on a rock. We let it stand the winter,
spectral, shagged, every sky its snow,
then cut it down, dismantled it in
pieces like disease. Then limbs from
the yellow poplar broke at will—
fell from the heights like bones
of the Puritans; even to gather them
in bundles seemed puritanical.
And the willow, by its nature, wept
long tears of its overbranching,
so pale they were autumnal. These
we turned too easily to switches,
mocking the bickering in the spruce's
nesting eaves, which crows, then jays
bothered all they could. The list,
the list. The sycamore made maps
of disappearance; the copper beech,
parental in its girth, was clipped
hard, by a car, with a wound that wouldn't
heal. Doctoring, then witchery, then
love—nothing we tried would work.
More apple trees that grew nowhere
but down. More maples spilling sugar.
More hawthorns blazing out, telling truth.


^^EOP^^

Light, so low upon earth,    You send a flash to the sun. Here is the golden close of love,    All my wooing is done. Oh, all the woods and the meadows,    Woods, where we hid from the wet, Stiles where we stayed to be kind,    Meadows in which we met! Light, so low in the vale    You flash and lighten afar, For this is the golden morning of love,    And you are his morning star. Flash, I am coming, I come,    By meadow and stile and wood, Oh, lighten into my eyes and my heart,    Into my heart and my blood! Heart, are you great enough    For a love that never tires? O heart, are you great enough for love?    I have heard of thorns and briers. Over the thorns and briers,    Over the meadows and stiles, Over the world to the end of it    Flash of a million miles.

1. 
Morning: the caged baby
sustains his fragile sleep.
The house is a husk against weather.
Nothing stirs—inside, outside.
With the leaves fallen,
the tree makes a web on the window
and through it the world
lacks color or texture,
like stones in the pasture
seen from this distance. 
This is what is done with pain:
ice on the wound,
the isolating tourniquet—
as though to check an open vein
where the self pumps out of the self
would stop the second movement of the heart,
diastolic, inclusive:
to love is to siphon loss into that chamber.   2. 
What does it mean when a woman says,
“my husband,”
if she sits all day in the tub;
if she worries her life like a dog a rat;
if her husband seems familiar but abstract,
a bandaged hand she’s forgotten how to use. 
They’ve reached the middle years.
Spared grief, they are given dread
as they tend the frail on either side of them.
Even their marriage is another child,
grown rude and querulous
since death practiced on them and withdrew. 
He asks of her only a little lie,
a pale copy drawn from the inked stone
where they loll beside the unicorn,
great lovers then, two strangers
joined by appetite:
                              it frightens her,
to live by memory’s poor diminished light.
She wants something crisp and permanent,
like coral—a crown, a trellis,
an iron shawl across the bed
where they are laced together,
the moon bleaching the house,
their bodies abandoned—   3. 
In last week’s mail,
still spread on the kitchen table,
the list of endangered species.
How plain the animals are,
quaint, domestic,
but the names lift from the page:
Woundfin. Whooping Crane. Squawfish.
Black-footed Ferret. California Least Tern. 
Dearest, the beast of Loch Ness, that shy,
broad-backed, two-headed creature,
may be a pair of whales or manatee,
male and female,
driven from their deep mud nest,
who cling to each other,
circling the surface of the lake.


^^EOP^^

when your man comes home from prison,
when he comes back like the wound
and you are the stitch,
when he comes back with pennies in his pocket
and prayer fresh on his lips,
you got to wash him down first. 
you got to have the wildweed and treebark boiled
and calmed, waiting for his skin like a shining baptism
back into what he was before gun barrels and bars
chewed their claim in his hide and spit him
stumbling backwards into screaming sunlight. 
you got to scrub loose the jailtime fingersmears
from ashy skin, lather down the cuffmarks
from ankle and wrist, rinse solitary’s stench loose
from his hair, scrape curse and confession
from the welted and the smooth,
the hard and the soft,
the furrowed and the lax. 
you got to hold tight that shadrach’s face
between your palms, take crease and lid
and lip and brow and rinse slow with river water,
and when he opens his eyes
you tell him calm and sure
how a woman birthed him
back whole again.

Yes, but beyond happiness what is there?
The question has not yet been answered.
No great quotations have issued forth
From there, we have no still photographs
Full of men in fine leather hiking boots,
Women with new-cut walking sticks.
So yes, it is the realm of thin tigers
Prowling, out to earn even more stripes;
It is the smell of seven or eight perfumes
Not currently available in America.
Maybe this is wrong, of course.
The place may after all be populated,
Or over-populated, with dented trash cans
In the streets and news of genital herpes
In every smart article in every slick magazine
Everywhere in the place.
But everybody there smiles—
Laughs, even, every time a breath can be caught.
This is all true.
Beyond happiness, it’s all the same,
Things come back to where we are now.
Of course maybe this is wrong,
But don’t believe it: a happiness exists,
All right, I have seen it for myself,
Touched it, touched the woman
Who with her daughter together keep
Ammonia in Mason jars by the side window.
They will throw it all in his face God
Damn him if he ever comes close again.


^^EOP^^

I have envied those   
who make something   
useful, sturdy—
a chair, a pair of boots. 
Even a soup,
rich with potatoes and cream. 
Or those who fix, perhaps,
a leaking window:
strip out the old cracked putty,
lay down cleanly the line of the new. 
You could learn,
the mirror tells me, late at night,   
but lacks conviction.
One reflected eyebrow quivers a little. 
I look at this
borrowed apartment—
everywhere I question it,
the wallpaper’s pattern matches. 
Yesterday a woman
showed me
a building shaped
like the overturned hull of a ship, 
its roof trusses, under the plaster,
lashed with soaked rawhide,
the columns’ marble
painted to seem like wood.
Though possibly it was the other way around? 
I look at my unhandy hand,
innocent,
shaped as the hands of others are shaped.   
Even the pen it holds is a mystery, really.  Rawhide, it writes,   
and chair, and marble. Eyebrow. 
Later the woman asked me—
I recognized her then,
my sister, my own young self—  Does a poem enlarge the world,   
or only our idea of the world?

A girl in a green mini-

I 
I’ve felt undeserving. I’ve made myself ill with the glory,
in the unleavened garden
disgorged the lies and scared away with a stick a snake.
What made me cover that which I could not have? 
I’ve grieved and walked in catacombs,
I’ve felt undeserving. I’ve made myself ill with the glory.
Even the falling leaves gesture their renunciation.
I disgorge the lies and abhor the serpent’s hiss. 
I remember seasons, things I bring from far away,
and grieve. I walk in catacombs.
In gardens now, by the stone walls, sunlight closes,
the falling leaves gesture their renunciation. 
I remember being in a field touching a man’s body.
I remember seasons, things I bring from far away
and things that hold their breath for shame.
His skin was soft as a girl’s and he closed his eyes. 
I placed apple petals on his eyelids;
we were lying in a field and I touched his body.
Then there were clouds, an uncanny silence,
as when in a green place the air holds its breath for shame. 
What made me covet what I could not have?
Ill with the power and glory, a thrashing in my chest,
I remember the unleavened gardens,
petals falling singly, the yellow snake disgorging lies.  
II 
I’ve grieved and walked in catacombs.
I’ve felt undeserving. I’ve made myself ill with the glory,
power and glory--
a thrashing in my rib cage. 
I’ve gone into the unleavened spring garden,
disgorged the lies,
and scared away with a stick a snake.
I’ve grieved and walked in catacombs. 
What made me cover that which I could not have?
I’ve felt undeserving. In this bright land
that changes from yellow to green and back to yellow,
I remember seasons, things I bring with me from far away 
and things that hold their breath as if for shame.
I’ve made myself ill with the power and glory.
I’ve gone into the unleavened garden
and startled a yellow snake 
disgorging lies. A thrashing in my rib cage.
What made me cover what I could not have?
I remember   seasons. Things that hold their breath for shame.
Things I bring with me from far away.  
III 
I’ve made myself ill with the power and glory.
I’ve made myself ill with the power and glory.

O that ’twere possibleAfter long grief and painTo find the arms of my true loveRound me once again!...
A shadow flits before me,Not thou, but like to thee:Ah, Christ! that it were possibleFor one short hour to seeThe souls we loved, that they might tell usWhat and where they be!



^^EOP^^

I have led her home, my love, my only friend, There is none like her, none. And never yet so warmly ran my blood And sweetly, on and on Calming itself to the long-wished-for end, Full to the banks, close on the promised good.  None like her, none. Just now the dry-tongued laurels’ pattering talk Seem’d her light foot along the garden walk, And shook my heart to think she comes once more; But even then I heard her close the door, The gates of Heaven are closed, and she is gone.  There is none like her, none. Nor will be when our summers have deceased. O, art thou sighing for Lebanon In the long breeze that streams to thy delicious East, Sighing for Lebanon, Dark cedar, tho’ thy limbs have here increased, Upon a pastoral slope as fair,  And looking to the South, and fed With honeyed rain and delicate air, And haunted by the starry head Of her whose gentle will has changed my fate, And made my life a perfumed altar-frame; And over whom thy darkness must have spread With such delight as theirs of old, thy great Forefathers of the thornless garden, there Shadowing the snow-limbed Eve from whom she came.  Here will I lie, while these long branches sway, And you fair stars that crown a happy day Go in and out as if at merry play, Who am no more so all forlorn, As when it seemed far better to be born To labour and the mattock-hardened hand Than nursed at ease and brought to understand A sad astrology, the boundless plan That makes you tyrants in your iron skies, Innumerable, pitiless, passionless eyes, Cold fires, yet with power to burn and brand His nothingness into man.  But now shine on, and what care I, Who in this stormy gulf have found a pearl The countercharm of space and hollow sky, And do accept my madness, and would die To save from some slight shame one simple girl.  Would die; for sullen-seeming Death may give More life to Love than is or ever was In our low world, where yet ’tis sweet to live. Let no one ask me how it came to pass; It seems that I am happy, that to me A livelier emerald twinkles in the grass, A purer sapphire melts into the sea.  Not die; but live a life of truest breath, And teach true life to fight with mortal wrongs. Oh, why should Love, like men in drinking-songs, Spice his fair banquet with the dust of death?  Make answer, Maud my bliss, Maud made my Maud by that long loving kiss, Life of my life, wilt thou not answer this? “The dusky strand of Death inwoven here With dear Love’s tie, makes love himself more dear.” Is that enchanted moan only the swell Of the long waves that roll in yonder bay? And hark the clock within, the silver knell Of twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white, And die to live, long as my pulses play; But now by this my love has closed her sight And given false death her hand, and stol’n away To dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell  Among the fragments of the golden day. May nothing there her maiden grace affright! Dear heart, I feel with thee the drowsy spell. My bride to be, my evermore delight, My own heart’s heart, my ownest own, farewell; It is but for a little space I go: And ye meanwhile far over moor and fell Beat to the noiseless music of the night! Has our whole earth gone nearer to the glow Of your soft splendour that you look so bright? I have climbed nearer out of lonely Hell. Beat, happy stars, timing with things below, Beat with my heart more blest than heart can tell. Blest, but for some dark undercurrent woe That seems to draw—but it shall not be so: Let all be well, be well.

Swung from the toes out,
Belly-breath riding on the knuckles,   
The ten-pound maul lifts up,
Sails in an arc overhead,
And then lifts you! 
It floats, you float,
For an instant of clear far sight—
Eye on the crack in the end-grain   
Angle of the oak round
Stood up to wait to be split. 
The maul falls—with a sigh—the wood   
Claps apart
                and lies twain—
In a wink. As the maul
Splits all, may 
You two stay together.

It was four days before they could get him to Chelsea Marine.
This spring I listened to him as good as new, as fresh as it’s always been
to hear him talk of the sea. He was puttering in his garden when I came up,
looking over his Santa Fe rose. And he took off his hat to show me,   
how it is all skin where his skull was,
too much of a hole for even the newest metal
to cover 
Or the quiet one, who’s died since (died as deck-watchman, on his vessel, in port).
Years ago I heard from others
how he’d pulled two men out of the sea one night
off Eastern Point. They’d not been able to shed their jacks
when the ship went over, and when he caught them
they were going down too. He hauled them into Brace’s Cove,
even though the shore wasn’t there, it was such a storm and the sea so big   
it had turned the Lily Pond
into an arm of itself. 
Last, he with muscle as big as his voice, the strength of him
in that blizzard
to have pulled the trawl slack from the very bottom and released   
his mate from the cod-hook had him out, and almost off,
into the snow. It wasn’t that there was so much sea. It was the cold,   
and that white, until over the dory went and the two of them,
one still,
were in. The wild thing was, he made the vessel, three miles, and fetched her,
found that vessel in all that weather, with his fellow dead weight   
on him. The sort of eye
which later knew the Peak of Brown’s

spot to her wharf a Christmas morning)

we’d both come on, tied to the Gas Company wharf.
She had raked masts, and they were unstepped,
fitted loose in her deck, like a neck in a collar.
He was looking idly, as I was, saying nothing.
When suddenly, he turned to a Gloucesterman, a big one,
berthed alongside this queer one, and said:
“I’ll own her, one day”

I have had to learn the simplest things
last. Which made for difficulties.
Even at sea I was slow, to get the hand out, or to cross   
a wet deck.
               The sea was not, finally, my trade.
But even my trade, at it, I stood estranged
from that which was most familiar. Was delayed,
and not content with the man’s argument
that such postponement   
is now the nature of
obedience,
               that we are all late
               in a slow time,
               that we grow up many
               And the single   
               is not easily
               known 
It could be, though the sharpness (the achiote)   
I note in others,
makes more sense
than my own distances. The agilities 
               they show daily
               who do the world’s   
               businesses
               And who do nature’s   
               as I have no sense   
               I have done either 
I have made dialogues,
have discussed ancient texts,
have thrown what light I could, offered   
what pleasures
doceat allows

of the weather, where it comes from,

or their rejection, of me

If we could only push these walls   
apart, unfold the room the way   
a child might take apart a box   
and lay it flat upon the floor—
so many corners cleared at last!   
Or else could rip away the roof   
and stare down at the dirty rooms,   
the hallways turning on themselves,   
and understand at last their plan—
dark maze without a minotaur,   
no monsters but ourselves.
                                       Yet who
could bear to see it all? The slow   
descending spirals of the dust   
against the spotted windowpane,   
the sunlight on the yellow lace,
the hoarded wine turned dark and sour,
the photographs, the letters—all   
the crowded closets of the heart. 
One wants to turn away—and cry   
for fire to break out on the stairs   
and raze each suffocating room.   
But the walls stay, the roof remains   
strong and immovable, and we   
can only pray that if these rooms   
have memories, they are not ours.

Across the road from where we nap
under a dead elm dazzles the meadow
where the partisans strung the traitors up, 
the meadow which their dangling shadows stain.
Belly up in vines a blasted tank
rusts flake by flake to lichened scrap iron 
while horseflies harangue
the rippling green, July
a limbo of quavering yellow... 
We wake to cattle lowing at dawn,
grass overgrowing summer—so like us
in love each hour with the noonday sun 
that neither toils nor spins, its brightness
hovering, blinding us...
What would the dead say if they could see us, 
lounging, talking, peering through brambles
at cemetery photographs sunk beneath
the undertow of milkweed shadows, 
death dates smoothing back into the stone?
I think of Goya’s demon, old man flesh
hanging from his bones, long teeth bared in 
an ass’s grin as he scrawls on a schoolboy’s
slate, What more can be done? Nothing...
while behind him a noose etched clean as 
the moon rises through the inkblot
spiraling back into the hanged man’s mouth
as if blackness poured from his throat: 
“When will you tire of us bogeymen,
caricatures of your father’s war,
our crimes half-forgotten, unforgiven? 
All future blotted out when they hauled us
from our beds, our minds went dead
to everything but fear: Nightshirts 
soaked in snowlight’s pall, we hunched in mud, each step
loud, too loud beside the farmhouse wall,
the seconds teetering till we drop... 
What our betrayals were we know
with a knowledge intimate beyond revenge,
history the needle’s eye you can’t squeeze through. 
The partisans cut us down, heaped us
in a mass grave our relatives dug up: Yes,
there were tears—even for us... 
Now, like aliens from space on your TV shows,
we ravel into mist, surrounding
you the moment your eyes close... 
Our pupils search out yours from behind
the mirror with your father’s stares,
fathers and sons melding in one mind— 
but who are you to call us traitors, an outsider
judging through the smoke-haze of home:
Each blow exact, our own neighbors 
beat us till the blood ran, beat us black
and blue...Even now, would they dare take us back,
older, wiser, necks broken by the yoke? 
Moving in time as to a dance we buzz
and swarm across the meadow, dissolving
and glinting like fireflies in the hedge, 
blown like milkweed in the moon’s wall eye.
But under your lids, you see us locked in cold,
shattered wheatstraw flecked in ice: 
Chill as the night air on your sunburned neck
our eyes like X rays pierce the frost,
stalking every step the living take.”

Recurrences.
Coppery light hesitates
again in the small-leaved 
Japanese plum. Summer
and sunset, the peace
of the writing desk 
and the habitual peace
of writing, these things
form an order I only 
belong to in the idleness
of attention. Last light
rims the blue mountain 
and I almost glimpse
what I was born to,
not so much in the sunlight 
or the plum tree
as in the pulse
that forms these lines.

A canoe made of horse ribs tipped over in the pasture.
Prairie flowers took it for a meetinghouse.
They grow there with a vengeance. 
Buck posts float across the flooded swamp
Where my father rode in and under.
Different horse. 
He held her head up out of the mud
And said how he was sorry
Till they came to pull him out. 
We found the white filly
On the only hard ground by the south gate.
He said she’d been a ghost from the start and he was right. 
We covered her with branches.
There were things he had the wrong names for
Like rose crystals. Though 
They were about what you’d think from a name like that.
He told us somewhere on Sand Creek Pass
Was a crystal that spelled our own initials 
And we should try to find it.
We walked through sagebrush and sand currents, looking.
He said pasqueflowers and paintbrush 
Wait till Easter to grow,
Then they come up even with snow still on the ground.
I thought I’d seen that happen.

each for himself.

after Baudelaire



Quiet now, sorrow; relax. Calm down, fear ...
You wanted the night? It’s falling, here,
Like a black glove onto the city,
Giving a few some peace ... but not me. 
I think, well, almost everyone I know
Loves to be whipped by pleasure—right, Killer?—
As they stroll the boardwalk, parading their despair.
So why don’t you come too? But instead, with me, 
Away from all these tattered ghosts leaning off
The sky’s balcony like last year’s lovers;
We’ll watch everything we regret step from the sea 
Dripping ... while the dead sun drags its arc
Towards China. Shroud of my heart, listen. Listen—
How softly the night steps toward us.

All the new thinking is about loss.
In this it resembles all the old thinking.
The idea, for example, that each particular erases
the luminous clarity of a general idea. That the clown-
faced woodpecker probing the dead sculpted trunk
of that black birch is, by his presence,
some tragic falling off from a first world
of undivided light. Or the other notion that,
because there is in this world no one thing
to which the bramble of blackberry corresponds,
a word is elegy to what it signifies.
We talked about it late last night and in the voice
of my friend, there was a thin wire of grief, a tone
almost querulous. After a while I understood that,
talking this way, everything dissolves: justice,
pine, hair, woman, you

                              Am I to become profligate as if I were a blonde? Or religious as if I were French?

          Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there’ll be nothing left with which to venture forth.

          Why should I share you? Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?

          I am the least difficult of men. All I want is boundless love.

          Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I? I’m just like a pile of leaves.

          However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery one wishes—I can’t even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life. It is more important to affirm the least sincere; the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what they’re missing? Uh huh.

          My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscriminate but fleeting, entirely specific and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always looking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and that makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black, brown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I am curious. On the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can spare myself little sleep.

          Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you are inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)

          St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in Dostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you in the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the ecstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a hyacinth, “to keep the filth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the filth is pumped in and courses and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may become famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.

          Destroy yourself, if you don’t know!

          It is easy to be beautiful; it is difficult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the trap you’ve set. It's like a final chapter no one reads because the plot is over.

          “Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that little Minx, & hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too. —Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whipping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.

       I’ve got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I’ll be back, I'll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go, so I go where you don’t want me to. It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t be any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.

The column of the commander yielded to our first sweep.
Even the water jar for our diggers we set on the south wall
of the general’s tomb without knowing it. So we began.
His armies retook Nubia, Libya, and the Levant,
lost under the sway-bellied lantern-jawed Sun King.
Overseer of all scribes, Overseer of the priests of Horus,
Grain-giver to all lands, Royal chief of staff, Regent,
the general had himself carried on his palanquin
through the wailing processions
to oversee the work on this place. And so carved, thus:
one of his men punches a Nubian in the face.
The general was low-born; everything had counted
and he knew what counted most.
His platoons lift open palms towards Tutankhamun.
The general towers as a sway-girdled go-between at court
for beseeching Libyans.
Only the pearl-handled revolvers do not figure here,
or the comeback challenge Nuts! in the Ardennes winter forest.
He had himself carried beyond the busy streets of the dead
in the city of the dead sloping back from the bluff
to a higher, private terrace looking across to Memphis.
But then he rose to Pharaoh. So he is not here. Instead
his first wife lay here, and then his queen also.
At his own royal tomb in the Valley, where the designs
remained uncarved, sketching idea along stone,
he does not rest either. The fine picklock hand
got past Anubis and the reared serpents, and got to him,
the Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt. It got past Truth
with her high feather, which moved at the slightest disturbance.
The general did deep obeisance to her. He is not here. 
What at last moves the heart? 
So much already moved, even in his own century,
architects prying loose mud bricks of the core for new tombs.
Cult funded in perpetuity gone in two generations.
So Coleridge, who was indisposed that day, prudently
remained in the circle of lime trees while his friends went off
on their walk through the countryside. He followed them in his mind.
That way no one would have to dismantle Horeheb’s outer court
to secure bricks for the statuary room, and facing stones.
He cast his mind outward, a net over his dear ones,
sending them at pace through the middle distance of steeples,
hill lines, and the murder of Lamb’s mother by his sister,
a brief madness, thus through the appropriately middle distance
where such things are built and performed in fact, no closer, no farther,
then on out to the cleansing rim of apocalypse, evening
in the bath of waning fire, one bird stitching
the whole veil of showings tight along its upper hem—
though he was not there, he could tell them that none the less
he was next to his words and his word was with them, even
unto the rim of their wandering and their turning back.
One dome of air and fire. But he was not there. Nor I here. 
What removes the heart from what moves it? 
As if I were the lecturer before a congress of doctors,
his clinching point approaching, when suddenly he stared out
in silence, and at last said, Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues,
the only thing I can see at this moment inside my brain,
such as it is, is a little white mouse chasing a little white ball.

I had come to the house, in a cave of trees,
Facing a sheer sky.
Everything moved,—a bell hung ready to strike,
Sun and reflection wheeled by. 
When the bare eyes were before me
And the hissing hair,
Held up at a window, seen through a door.
The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead
Formed in the air. 
This is a dead scene forever now.
Nothing will ever stir.
The end will never brighten it more than this,
Nor the rain blur. 
The water will always fall, and will not fall,
And the tipped bell make no sound.
The grass will always be growing for hay
Deep on the ground. 
And I shall stand here like a shadow
Under the great balanced day,
My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind,
And does not drift away.

Love, meet me in the green glen,
 Beside the tall elm-tree,Where the sweetbriar smells so sweet agen;
 There come with me.
  Meet me in the green glen.
Meet me at the sunset
 Down in the green glen,Where we’ve often met
 By hawthorn-tree and foxes’ den,
  Meet me in the green glen.
Meet me in the green glen,
 By sweetbriar bushes there;Meet me by your own sen,
 Where the wild thyme blossoms fair.
  Meet me in the green glen.
Meet me by the sweetbriar,
 By the mole-hill swelling there;When the west glows like a fire
 God’s crimson bed is there.
  Meet me in the green glen.

“Who are you to tell us how to live or why,
et cetera?”   No Man, of course, and not so tall   
as is the current fashion, nor smart enough
in the acceptable modern way, to enthrall 
the crowd with stories of my life among
the savages where I was home and growing
baffled day by day, raging through the night
as if it were new music I made, groaing. 
It came to me today at lunch, the sound
of women in the next booth, a voice like
Aunt Odile’s—whom I never knew well
nor did I like her, but not her spite 
but her voice like home-grown fame, a touch
gravelly, a considerable groan itself, it seemed.
They spoke outmoded French around me, never
to me, except to taunt, I thought.   She leaned 
above me, on those visits, speaking to Mother
in their private French, laughing.   A boy
surrounded by the sound of foreign tongues
knowing what wasn’t meant for him:   toy 
temptations, suggestive coils of syllables.
I learned Latin, for Mass, and did love
its terrific laddered randomness:   
The Blessed hovering Virgin above 
every station of a boy’s new path, hormonal
disharmonies, her praises sung into hundreds
the first Tuesday of every month: and yet
Latin could not expose such shreds 
of glittering flesh as I found in French,
not like the living tongue whose tip twined
into an Uncle’s mustache as he leered
at the wrong Aunt and winked and a fine 
distance crystallized loud there, then
gone. Crashing like German. Father’s family
spoke clear English among the bayous, boys
and girls of immigrants accentless happily 
German through two wars, not counting
Civil.   I had the tongue for arithmetic
and spoke it beautifully.   I loved to count:   
precision’s a tempting career, clicking 
into a future like an abacus ignoring
all those accents around.
I never learned the luck of any
but English, bland and bound. 
But only yesterday I heard a word
the mechanic said in Czech
to his cousin—shop rag—clearly centered
in a welter of incomprehension, the wreck 
of my car at their wretched mercies:   shop
rag.   And he wiped his hands and cried   
for me, shrugging like a cousin would.
I wrote a check. I drove home, or tried. 
So does it count?   Am I a man of passion or
child of comprehension?   “Father of little lusts
driving myself home who thinks:   Buy some
sentiment, a little like love and she must 
speak French this time. She longs
for you, you know; it isn’t just the money.
America loves you for yourself alone”
and so I go for professional help, honey- 
blond hair and a disposition like
a happy banker, whose French for dear
sounds like dog; the cost of living
is going up, loving her here.

It is easily forgotten, year to
year, exactly where the plot is,
though the place is entirely familiar—
a willow tree by a curving roadway
sweeping black asphalt with tender leaves; 
damp grass strewn with flower boxes,
canvas chairs, darkskinned old ladies
circling in draped black crepe family stones,
fingers cramped red at the knuckles, discolored
nails, fresh soil for new plants, old rosaries; 
such fingers kneading the damp earth gently down
on new roots, black humus caught in grey hair
brushed back, and the single waterfaucet,
birdlike upon its grey pipe stem,
a stream opening at its foot. 
We know the stories that are told,
by starts and stops, by bent men at strange joy
regarding the precise enactments of their own
gesturing. And among the women there will be
a naming of families, a counting off, an ordering. 
The morning may be brilliant; the season
is one of brilliances—sunlight through
the fountained willow behind us, its splayed
shadow spreading westward, our shadows westward,
irregular across damp grass, the close-set stones. 
It may be that since our walk there is faltering,
moving in careful steps around snow-on-the-mountain,
bluebells and zebragrass toward that place
between the willow and the waterfaucet, the way
is lost, that we have no practiced step there,
and walking, our own sway and balance, fails us.

After our march from the Hudson to the top

the sermons and hot sun while Girl Scouts
lolled among graves in the maple shade.
When members of the veterans’ honor guard

I glimpsed beneath one metal helmet
the salmon-pink flesh of Mr. Webber’s nose,

Friends who sat near me in school died in Asia,
now lie here under new stones that small flags flap
beside.
          It’s fifth-grade recess: war stories.
Mr. Webber stands before us and plucks
his glass eye from its socket, holds it high
between finger and thumb. The girls giggle
and scream; the awed boys gape. The fancy pocket watch
he looted from a shop in Germany
ticks on its chain.

Only teaching on Tuesdays, book-worming
in pajamas fresh from the washer each morning,
I hog a whole house on Boston’s
“hardly passionate Marlborough Street,”
where even the man
scavenging filth in the back alley trash cans,
has two children, a beach wagon, a helpmate,
and is a “young Republican.”
I have a nine months’ daughter,
young enough to be my granddaughter.
Like the sun she rises in her flame-flamingo infants’ wear. 
These are the tranquillized Fifties, 
and I am forty. Ought I to regret my seedtime?   
I was a fire-breathing Catholic C.O.,
and made my manic statement,
telling off the state and president, and then   
sat waiting sentence in the bull pen
beside a Negro boy with curlicues
of marijuana in his hair. 
Given a year,
I walked on the roof of the West Street Jail, a short   
enclosure like my school soccer court,   
and saw the Hudson River once a day   
through sooty clothesline entanglements   
and bleaching khaki tenements.
Strolling, I yammered metaphysics with Abramowitz,
a jaundice-yellow (“it’s really tan”)   
and fly-weight pacifist,
so vegetarian,
he wore rope shoes and preferred fallen fruit.   
He tried to convert Bioff and Brown,
the Hollywood pimps, to his diet.
Hairy, muscular, suburban,
wearing chocolate double-breasted suits,
they blew their tops and beat him black and blue. 
I was so out of things, I’d never heard
of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“Are you a C.O.?” I asked a fellow jailbird.   
“No,” he answered, “I’m a J.W.”
He taught me the “hospital tuck,”
and pointed out the T-shirted back
of Murder Incorporated’s Czar Lepke,   
there piling towels on a rack,
or dawdling off to his little segregated cell full   
of things forbidden the common man:
a portable radio, a dresser, two toy American   
flags tied together with a ribbon of Easter palm.   
Flabby, bald, lobotomized,
he drifted in a sheepish calm,
where no agonizing reappraisal
jarred his concentration on the electric chair—
hanging like an oasis in his air
of lost connections....

Perhaps, when we the strangers in the bar’s blue light   
   turn liberal, you’d claim fraternity
or clan and say Detroit is turned American
   by the community of appetite. 
There was this hurried time of fear of the last bell,   
   our sure prognostication it would be
somber so soon to face a sky of December
   that impended on the light blue snow swell, 
when someone turned and told of Caucasian wheat fields,   
   the harvest sun, a last effrontery.
His father decapitates their Turkish master.
   The village is invested. No one yields. 
Then, you may know, the last round came, and with it pride.   
   I swivelled round to face my own whiskey
recalling anecdotes in turn of ancestral
   snowfields and running wolves and fireside.

We spend our morning
in the flower stalls counting
the dark tongues of bells
that hang from ropes waiting   
for the silence of an hour.
We find a table, ask for paella,
cold soup and wine, where a calm   
light trembles years behind us. 
In Buenos Aires only three
years ago, it was the last time his hand   
slipped into her dress, with pearls   
cooling her throat and bells like
these, chipping at the night— 
As she talks, the hollow
clopping of a horse, the sound   
of bones touched together.
The paella comes, a bed of rice   
and camarones, fingers and shells,   
the lips of those whose lips
have been removed, mussels
the soft blue of a leg socket. 
This is not paella, this is what
has become of those who remained   
in Buenos Aires. This is the ring   
of a rifle report on the stones,   
her hand over her mouth,
her husband falling against her. 
These are the flowers we bought   
this morning, the dahlias tossed
on his grave and bells
waiting with their tongues cut out   
for this particular silence.

Up stand
             six
yellow
          jonquils
in a
       glass/
the stems
               dark green,
paling
          as they descend
into the water/
                      seen through
a thicket
               of baby’s breath, “a tall herb
bearing numerous small,
                                    fragrant white flowers.”
I have seen
                  snow-drops larger.
I bent my face down.
                               To my delight
they were convoluted
                               like a rose.
They had no smell,
                            their white
the grain of Biblical dust,
                                        which like the orchid itself
is as common as hayseed.
                                     Their stems were thin and woody
but as tightly compacted
                                     as a tree trunk,
greenish rubbings showing in spots
                                                    through the brown;
wiry, forked twigs so close,
                                           they made an impassable bush
which from a distance
                                 looked like mist. 
I could barely escape
                                 from that wood of particulars ...
the jonquils whose air within
                                             was irradiated topaz,
silent as in an ear,
                               the stems leaning lightly
against the glass,
                            trisecting its inner circle
in the water,
                     crossed like reverent hands
(ah, the imagination!
                                 Benedicite.
Enter monks.
                   Oops, sorry!
Trespassing
                  on Japanese space.
Exit monks
                and all their lore
from grace). 
I was moved by all this
                                    and murmured
to my eyes, “Oh, Master!”
                                       and became engrossed again
in that wood of particulars
                                          until I found myself
out of character, singing
         “Tell me why you’ve settled here.” 
         “Because my element is near.”
and reflecting,
                        “The eye of man cares. Yes!” 
But a familiar voice
                               broke into the wood,
a shade of mockery in it,
                                       and in her smile
a fore-knowledge
                         of something playful,
something forbidden,
                               something make-believe
something saucy,
                         something delicious
about to pull me
                         off guard:
“Do you want to be my Cupid-o?” 
In fairness to her
                            it must be said
that her freckles
                           are always friendly
and that the anticipation
                                       of a prank
makes them radiate
                            across her face
the way dandelions
                            sprout in a field
after a summer shower. 
“What makes you so fresh,
                                       my Wife of Bath?
What makes you so silly,
                                     o bright hen?” 
“That’s for you to find out,
                                           old shoe, old shoe.
That’s for you to find out
                                        if you can.” 
“Oh yeah!”
                (a mock chase and capture).
“Commit her
                  into jonquil’s custody.
She’ll see a phallus
                               in the pistil.
Let her work it off there.” 
But I was now myself
                                  under this stringent force
which ended,
                   as real pastorals in time must,
in bed, with the great
                                  eye of man, rolling.

I 
King of the perennial holly-groves, the riven sandstone: overlord of the M5: architect of the historic rampart and ditch, the citadel at Tamworth, the summer hermitage in Holy Cross: guardian of the Welsh Bridge and the Iron Bridge: contractor to the desirable new estates: saltmaster: moneychanger: commissioner for oaths: martyrologist: the friend of Charlemagne. 
‘I liked that,’ said Offa, ‘sing it again.’   IV 
I was invested in mother-earth, the crypt of roots and endings. Child’s-play. I abode there, bided my time: where the mole 
shouldered the clogged wheel, his gold solidus; where dry-dust badgers thronged the Roman flues, the long-unlooked-for mansions of our tribe.   V 
So much for the elves’ wergild, the true governance of England, the gaunt warrior-gospel armoured in engraved stone. I wormed my way heavenward for ages amid barbaric ivy, scrollwork of fern. 
Exile or pilgrim set me once more upon that ground: my rich and desolate childhood. Dreamy, smug-faced, sick on outings—I who was taken to be a king of some kind, a prodigy, a maimed one.   VI 
The princes of Mercia were badger and raven. Thrall to their freedom, I dug and hoarded. Orchards fruited above clefts. I drank from honeycombs of chill sandstone. 
‘A boy at odds in the house, lonely among brothers.’ But I, who had none, fostered a strangeness; gave myself to unattainable toys. 
Candles of gnarled resin, apple-branches, the tacky mistletoe. ‘Look’ they said and again ‘look.’ But I ran slowly; the landscape flowed away, back to its source. 
In the schoolyard, in the cloakrooms, the children boasted their scars of dried snot; wrists and knees garnished with impetigo.   X 
He adored the desk, its brown-oak inlaid with ebony, assorted prize pens, the seals of gold and base metal into which he had sunk his name. 
It was there that he drew upon grievances from the people; attended to signatures and retributions; forgave the death-howls of his rival. And there he exchanged gifts with the Muse of History. 
What should a man make of remorse, that it might profit his soul? Tell me. Tell everything to Mother, darling, and God bless. 
He swayed in sunlight, in mild dreams. He tested the little pears. He smeared catmint on his palm for his cat Smut to lick. He wept, attempting to master ancilla and servus.   XI 
Coins handsome as Nero’s; of good substance and weight. Offa Rex resonant in silver, and the names of his moneyers. They struck with accountable tact. They could alter the king’s face. 
Exactness of design was to deter imitation; mutilation if that failed. Exemplary metal, ripe for commerce. Value from a sparse people, scrapers of salt-pans and byres. 
Swathed bodies in the long ditch; one eye upstaring. It is safe to presume, here, the king’s anger. He reigned forty years. Seasons touched and retouched the soil. 
Heathland, new-made watermeadow. Charlock, marsh-marigold. Crepitant oak forest where the boar furrowed black mould, his snout intimate with worms and leaves.   XV 
Tutting, he wrenched at a snarled root of dead crabapple. It rose against him. In brief cavort he was Cernunnos, the branched god, lightly concussed. 
He divided his realm. It lay there like a dream. An ancient land, full of strategy. Ramparts of compost pioneered by red-helmeted worms. Hemlock in ambush, night-soil, tetanus. A wasps’ nest ensconced in the hedge-bank, a reliquary or wrapped head, the corpse of Cernunnos pitching dayward its feral horns.   XVI 
Clash of salutation. As keels thrust into shingle. Ambassadors, pilgrims. What is carried over? The Frankish gift, two-edged, regaled with slaughter. 
The sword is in the king’s hands; the crux a craftsman’s triumph. Metal effusing its own fragrance, a variety of balm. And other miracles, other exchanges. 
Shafts from the winter sun homing upon earth’s rim. Christ’s mass: in the thick of a snowy forest the flickering evergreen fissured with light. 
Attributes assumed, retribution entertained. What is borne amongst them? Too much or too little. Indulgences of bartered acclaim; an expenditure, a hissing. Wine, urine and ashes.   XXVII 
‘Now when King Offa was alive and dead’, they were all there, the funereal gleemen: papal legate and rural dean; Merovingian car-dealers, Welsh mercenaries; a shuffle of house-carls. 
He was defunct. They were perfunctory. The ceremony stood acclaimed. The mob received memorial vouchers and signs. 
After that shadowy, thrashing midsummer hail-storm, Earth lay for a while, the ghost-bride of livid Thor, butcher of strawberries, and the shire-tree dripped red in the arena of its uprooting.   XXX 
And it seemed, while we waited, he began to walk towards us             he vanished 
he left behind coins, for his lodging, and traces of red mud.

In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,Faith and unfaith can ne’er be equal powers:Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.
It is the little rift within the lute,That by and by will make the music mute,And ever widening slowly silence all.
The little rift within the lover’s lute,Or little pitted speck in garner’d fruit,That rotting inward slowly moulders all.
It is not worth the keeping: let it go:But shall it? answer, darling, answer, no.And trust me not at all or all in all.

The messenger runs, not carrying the news
of victory, or defeat; the messenger, unresting,
   has always been running, the wind before and behind him,
    across the turning back of earth, leaving
      his tracks across the plains, his ropes
       hanging from the ledges of mountains;
         for centuries, millennia, he has been running
       carrying whatever it is that cannot be
      put down: it is rolled in a tube
    made of hide, carefully, to keep it dry
   as he runs, through storms and monsoons,
sometimes on foot, sometimes poling a boat
through a flooded mangrove swamp, or
   setting stiff sails to cross from island to island
    running before the wind. In some ages, peasants
      have helped him—bringing him small cakes
       of rice wrapped in the weeds of the sea and
         new sandals woven of hemp for his torn
       bleeding feet; sometimes in the heat of noon
      they would offer a drink of rosewater, sometimes
   a coat of fur against the winter snows;
and sometimes at night, he would rest
by a fire where voices wove with the music
   of gut-strings, or with mountain pipes whose
    sound was like wind through the bones
      of creation—and he would be cheered
       by the company of others, the firelit glow
         of their faces like a bright raft afloat in the dark;
       at times, rumors spread of his death, scholars
      analyzed his obsession, dated his bones, his prayer bundle;
   but at dawn, he always arose, in the mists,
in the blur of so many mornings, so many shoes
worn into scraps and discarded, so many
   the cities that burned as he passed
    them, so many the skulls abandoned
      by armies, so many whose blood
       stained the threads of their prayer rugs,
         so many, so many, so many—
      oh,
    and that green, sunlit hill that kept
   rising from the dark waters of flood, outlined bright
against the sky, the odds, the evidence—
and he, the messenger,
running through history, carries this small tube,
   its durable hide—carries it, not like
    a torch, no, nothing so blazing;
      not like the brass lamp that summons
       a genie, no magic wishes;
      not like the candles that hope sets aflame
    and a breath can extinguish ... 
no.
He carried it like
   what has no likeness,
    what is curled up inside and
      he swore he could feel it, though
       perhaps he had dreamed it, still
         at times, stopping under some tree
       or other, when the night was warm,
      so close the stars seemed to breathe in
   the branches, he would lie quiet,
then it would seem
that whatever it was in there
would pulse softly with light, a code
   only the heart could break
    (but of course he couldn’t say
      for he was only the messenger)—
    and at sunrise, wearily, he would rise
      to his feet and trudge on, sometimes
       running, sometimes stumbling,
         carrying whatever it was that could not
          be put down, would not be cast aside—
         and besides, he would chide himself,
       weren’t they all as tired as he,
      and hadn’t they helped him, time
    and again, on his way?

                    In cities there are tangerine briefcases on the down-platform
and jet parkas on the up-platform; in the mother of cities
there is equal anxiety at all terminals.
    West a business breast, North a morose jig, East a false
    escape, South steam in milk.

The centres of cities move westwards; the centre of the
mother of cities has disappeared.
    North the great cat, East the great water, South the great
    fire, West the great arrow.

In cities the sons of women become fathers; in the mother of
cities the daughters of men have failed to become mothers.
    East the uneager fingers, South the damp cave, West the
    chained ankle, North the rehearsed cry.

Cities are built for trade, where women and men may freely
through knowing each other become more like themselves;
the mother of cities is built for government, where women
and men through fearing each other become more like each
other than they care to be.
    South the short, West the soap, North the sheets, East the
    shivers.

In cities the church fund is forever stuck below blood heat; in
the mother of cities the church is a community arts centre.
    West the Why-not, North the Now-then, East the End-
    product, South the Same-again.

In cities nobody can afford the price; in the mother of cities
nobody dares to ask the price.
    North the telephone smile, East the early appointment,
    South the second reminder, West the hanging button.

In cities the jealous man is jealous because he is himself in his
imagination unfaithful; in the mother of cities the jealous man
is jealous because he reads the magazines.
    East the endless arrival, South the astounding statistic,
    West the wasted words, North the night of nights.

In cities we dream about our desires; in the mother of cities
we dream about our dreams.

Half of my life is gone, and I have let    The years slip from me and have not fulfilled    The aspiration of my youth, to build    Some tower of song with lofty parapet. Not indolence, nor pleasure, nor the fret    Of restless passions that would not be stilled,    But sorrow, and a care that almost killed,    Kept me from what I may accomplish yet; Though, half-way up the hill, I see the Past    Lying beneath me with its sounds and sights,—    A city in the twilight dim and vast, With smoking roofs, soft bells, and gleaming lights,—    And hear above me on the autumnal blast    The cataract of Death far thundering from the heights.

Man of himself’s a little world, but join’dWith woman, woman for that end design’d,(Hear cruel fair one whilst I this rehearse!)He makes up then a complete universe.

The surfers beautiful as men
                                           can be
ride the warm
                     blue green
                                     swells
and the white sand is alive with girls.
Outriggers (double boats) ride the waves back in
as the native warriors did.
I tried to swim and tried to look,
but ended up just going back:
a huge, perfect black
man at the beach
somehow drove me away a block
to St. Augustine’s Church.
The bodies were giv-
                              ing me a fit
and I have come to seek the momentary calm
we find sometimes in the musk of Christ
(when he was awake
                            and sweat-
ing blood
               as others slept,
or like a furious bouncer
hustling out the money changers).
The bodies of Mary and Christ
both still live, we’re told. They’re alive
and thus
must have dealt with the stress
of that long time
                           of turning on
to being young.
I speak of teens.
                           Fifteen and ten 
years ago when I first confessed,
it was in this same church built then
as a gigantic shed
where the strange Hawaiian birds
(I forgot their names—no matter)
flew in and out of the high wood-
en rafters
like the whimsical winds of grace,
and grace gives back to sight
what beauty is—
                        as
that loveliness at the beach.
Now the church
                      has been rebuilt
in pointed stone across the street
from a much
                  higher new hotel
where at lunch
                      I almost spilled
and found I could not eat
the purple orchid in my drink.

I  Jesús, Estrella, Esperanza, Mercy: 
       Sails flashing to the wind like weapons,
       sharks following the moans the fever and the dying;   
       horror the corposant and compass rose. 
Middle Passage:
               voyage through death
                               to life upon these shores. 
       “10 April 1800—
       Blacks rebellious. Crew uneasy. Our linguist says   
       their moaning is a prayer for death,
       ours and their own. Some try to starve themselves.   
       Lost three this morning leaped with crazy laughter   
       to the waiting sharks, sang as they went under.”  Desire, Adventure, Tartar, Ann: 
       Standing to America, bringing home   
       black gold, black ivory, black seed. 
               Deep in the festering hold thy father lies,   
               of his bones New England pews are made,   
               those are altar lights that were his eyes.

‘Are you asleep?’
Like a door that always opens
on the same empty closet,
the old jokey question
you can never answer ‘yes’ to
is a snap, in comparison
to ‘Where are you?’ 
Moving, wherever you are.
Even your stillness on the back seat takes
the bent of action, a kicking reach
through swells and drifts of afghan.
My live question mark,
are they salt or sweet, the waters
you riddle? 
Asking gets me as far
as ladling water with a net.
Though I can catch your small
beached foot, and hear
soft waves of breath, the mesh
of senses isn’t fine enough
to land you now. 
When you come back,
you’ll rub the sand from your eyes
and know nothing of where you’ve been.
Love is like that: the element
we breathe and move through,
untouchable and always
there.

The earth had wanted us all to itself.
The mountains wanted us back for themselves.
The numbered valleys of serpentine wanted us;
that’s why it happened as it did, the split
as if one slow gear turned beneath us. . .
Then the Tuesday shoppers paused in the street
and the tube that held the trout-colored train
and the cords of action from triangular buildings
and the terraced gardens that held camelias
shook and shook, each flower a single thought. 
Mothers and children took cover under tables.
I called out to her who was my life.
From under the table—I hid under the table
that held the begonia with the fiery stem,
the stem that had been trying to root, that paused
in its effort—I called to the child who was my life.
And understood, in the endless instant
before she answered, how Pharaoh’s army, seeing
the ground break open, seeing the first fringed
horses fall into the gap, made their vows,
that each heart changes, faced with a single awe
and in that moment a promise is written out. 
However we remember California later
the earth we loved will know the truth:
that it wanted us back for itself
with our mighty forms and our specific longings,
wanted them to be air and fire but they wouldn’t;
the kestrel circled over a pine, which lasted,
the towhee who loved freedom, gathering seed
during the shaking lasted, the painting released
by the wall, the mark and hook we placed
on the wall, and the nail, and the memory
of driving the nail in, these also lasted—

Mild is the parting year, and sweet
     The odour of the falling spray;Life passes on more rudely fleet,
     And balmless is its closing day.
I wait its close, I court its gloom,
     But mourn that never must there fallOr on my breast or on my tomb
     The tear that would have soothed it all.

Joy to the bridegroom and the brideThat lie by one another’s side!O fie upon the virgin beds,No loss is gain but maidenheads.Love quickly send the time may beWhen I shall deal my rosemary!
I long to simper at a feast,To dance, and kiss, and do the rest.When I shall wed, and bedded beO then the qualm comes over me,And tells the sweetness of a themeThat I ne’er knew but in a dream.
You ladies have the blessed nights,I pine in hope of such delights.And silly damsel only canMilk the cows’ teats and think on man:And sigh and wish to taste and proveThe wholesome sillabub of love.
Make haste, at once twin-brothers bear;And leave new matter for a star.Women and ships are never shownSo fair as when their sails be blown.Then when the midwife hears your moan,I’ll sigh for grief that I have none.
And you, dear knight, whose every kissReaps the full crop of Cupid’s bliss,Now you have found, confess and tellThat single sheets do make up hell.And then so charitable beTo get a man to pity me.

Four-fifty. The palings of Trinity Church
Burying Ground, a few inches above the earth,
are sunk in green light. The low stones
like pale books knocked sideways. The bus so close to the curb
that brush-drops of ebony paint stand out wetly, the sunlight
seethes with vibrations, the sidewalks
on Whitehall shudder with subterranean tremors. Overhead, faint flickers 
crackle down the window-paths: limpid telegraphy of the
late afternoon July thunderstorm unfurling over Manhattan.
Its set and luminous velocity, long stalks of stormlight, and then the first drops
strike their light civic stripes on the pavement.
Between the palings, oat-panicles sift a few bright
grains to the stonecourse. Above it, at shoulder height
a side door is flung open, fire-exits; streaming from lobbies 
come girls and women, white girls in shadowy-striped rayon skirts, plastic ear-hoops,
black girls in gauzy-toned nylons, ripples of cornrows and plaits,
one girl with shocked-back ash hair, lightened eyebrows;
one face from Easter Island, mauve and granitic;
thigh on thigh, waist by waist; the elbow’s curlicue and the fingers’; elbow-work, heel-work,
are suddenly absorbed in the corduroyed black rubber stairs of the bus. Humid
sighs, settlings, each face tilts up to the windows’
shadowless yards of mercuric green plate glass. An
interspace then, like the slowing of some rural
water-mill, a creaking and dipping pause
of black-splintered paddles, the irregularly
dappled off-lighting—bottle-green—the lucid slim sluice
falling back in a stream from the plank edge. It won’t take us
altogether, we say, the mill-race—it won’t churn us up altogether. We’ll keep
a glib stretch of leisure water, like our self’s self—to reflect the sky.
But we won’t (says the bus rider now to herself). Nothing’s
left over, really, from labor. They’ve taken it all for the mill-race. 
In close-ups now, you can see it in every face,
despite the roped rain light pouring down the bus-windows—
it’s the strain of gravity itself, of life hours cut off and offered
to the voice that says “Give me this day your
life, that is LABOR, and I’ll give you back
one day, then another. For mine are the terms.”
It’s gravity, spilling in capillaries, cheek-tissue trembling,
despite the make-up, the monograms, the mass-market designer scarves, 
the army of signs disowning the workplace and longing for night ...
But even as the rain slackens, labor
lengthens itself along Broadway. The night signs
come on, that wit has set up to draw money: O’DONNELL’S,
BEIRUT CAFE, YONAH’S KNISH

It is the miller’s daughter,
 And she is grown so dear, so dear,That I would be the jewel
 That trembles at her ear:For hid in ringlets day and night,I’d touch her neck so warm and white.
And I would be the girdle 
 About her dainty, dainty waist,And her heart would beat against me,
 In sorrow and in rest:And I should know if it beat right,I’d clasp it round so close and tight.
And I would be the necklace,
 And all day long to fall and riseUpon her balmy bosom,
 With her laughter or her sighs:And I would lie so light, so light,I scarce should be unclasped at night.

I was miserable, of course, for I was seventeen,
and so I swung into action and wrote a poem, 
and it was miserable, for that was how I thought
poetry worked: you digested experience and shat 
literature. It was 1960 at The Showplace, long since
defunct, on West 4th St., and I sat at the bar, 
casting beer money from a thin reel of ones,
the kid in the city, big ears like a puppy. 
And I knew Mingus was a genius. I knew two
other things, but they were wrong, as it happened. 
So I made him look at the poem.
“There’s a lot of that going around,” he said, 
and Sweet Baby Jesus he was right. He laughed
amiably. He didn’t look as if he thought 
bad poems were dangerous, the way some poets do.
If they were baseball executives they’d plot 
to destroy sandlots everywhere so that the game
could be saved from children.   Of course later 
that night he fired his pianist in mid-number
and flurried him from the stand. 
“We’ve suffered a diminuendo in personnel,”
he explained, and the band played on.

Under Mirabeau Bridge the river slips away
          And lovers
    Must I be reminded
Joy came always after pain  
         The night is a clock chiming
         The days go by not I  
We're face to face and hand in hand
         While under the bridges
    Of embrace expire
Eternal tired tidal eyes  
         The night is a clock chiming
         The days go by not I  
Love elapses like the river
         Love goes by
    Poor life is indolent
And expectation always violent  
         The night is a clock chiming
         The days go by not I  
The days and equally the weeks elapse
         The past remains the past
    Love remains lost
Under Mirabeau Bridge the river slips away  
         The night is a clock chiming
         The days go by not I

Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
—The Tempest 



The only potion I saw him brew was tea
of his own blend, a mash of leaves and bark.   
Good for whatever ailed you was his claim,
as if he could see the leaps and falls
he’d named “the heart.” Who knows?
                                                    For argument,   
just say he had no need, had made me up:
one in his likeness, who wouldn’t touch the stuff.   
Who tried to see a window where he outlined   
in air its air of distance, ladylike,
a pane designed to cut you off from the world   
of the dunghill and the worm. 
Who fashioned a cloak of leaves that aped his cape,   
mine only as magic as waterproof, a screen   
against the downpour day after day of sun,   
unlike the one he wrapped in and became   
no longer Father but some other, a stranger—
the island’s only one—the local god,   
or was it merely King of Somewhere Else? 
Or mother country, I his colony?
He held forth promise of some other isle,   
no drier but more “cultivated,” not   
just with crops but with quotation marks.
How he held forth, dutiful silence mine to guard.   
I borrowed foreign names from the remains   
of a map that washed ashore, my own worn out
through under-use. So, Carolina North,   
or South? Virginia West?
                                    As long as I
remembered not to answer to “Miranda!”,   
the call of parent bird to fledgling ingrate,   
then I was not the heir apparent but   
your normal castaway, a little bored
with ins and outs of tidepools’ smelly courts. 
Perhaps not world enough, but I had time   
to watch a hermit crab align himself
and back into a vacant whelk and haul
the home he wore from rocky A to B.
All that watching—watching for what? A sail   
blown off its course by my uncalled-for sighs? 
A gorgeous morning, same as yesterday,
I in the same old shirt he’d handed down,   
divining rightly that if it failed to fit,   
a scabbard’s belt would cinch it as a dress.
To the crab’s new quarters a small limpet clung.   
What did I want to be? What did I know   
but him, the man who’d loved his subjects less   
than his library, who’d lost his kingdom, who   
couldn’t put down a book he’d yet to finish? 
How close the air remote upon that isle,   
the like of which I have not breathed again.   
How it held water, building up a wall   
by keeping molecules apart. How close   
those castles, not to be counted on except
to rumble, then to wilt late afternoons,   
all squandered weakness.
                                     Whatever I had sensed
about my difference I caught from him   
or from the books he carried in his head.   
Such dreams he made on me.
I am a leaf torn loose from his drowned book.
All men are islands, though they swear otherwise.   
All islands are alike in their unhappiness.

When Miriam Tazewell heard the tempest bursting   
And his wrathy whips across the sky drawn crackling   
She stuffed her ears for fright like a young thing   
And with heart full of the flowers took to weeping. 
But the earth shook dry his old back in good season,
He had weathered storms that drenched him deep as this one,   
And the sun, Miriam, ascended to his dominion,
The storm was withered against his empyrean. 
After the storm she went forth with skirts kilted   
To see in the hot sun her lawn deflowered,   
Her tulip, iris, peony strung and pelted,
Pots of geranium spilled and the stalks naked. 
The spring transpired in that year with no flowers   
But the regular stars went busily on their courses,   
Suppers and cards were calendared, and some bridals,   
And the birds demurely sang in the bitten poplars. 
To Miriam Tazewell the whole world was villain,   
The principle of the beast was low and masculine,   
And not to unstop her own storm and be maudlin,   
For weeks she went untidy, she went sullen.

"We will gather images and images of images up till the
last, which is blank. This one we will agree on."
- Reb Carasso



                    
                    Mardohai Simhon claimed the silk scarf he wore around his neck was a mirror.
    "Look," he said, "my head is separated from my body by a scarf. Who dares give me the life if I say I walk with a knotted mirror under my chin?
    "The scarf reflects a face, and you think it is of flesh.
    "Night is the mirror. Day the scarf. Moon and sun reflected features. But my true face, brothers, where did I lose it?"
    At his death, a large scar was discovered on his neck.
    The meaning of this anecdote was discussed by the rabbis.
    Reb Alphandery, in his authority as the oldest, spoke first.
    "A double mirror," he said, "separates us from the Lord so that God sees Himself when trying to see us, and we, when trying to see Him, see only our own face."
    "Is appearance no more than the reflections thrown back and forth by a set of mirrors?" asked Reb Ephraim. "You are no doubt alluding to the soul, Reb Alphandery, in which we see ourselves mirrored. But the body is the place of the soul, just as the mountain is the bed of the brook. The body has broken the mirror."
    "The brook," continued Reb Alphandery, "sleeps on the summit. The brook's dream is of water, as is the brook. It flows for us. Our dreams extend us.
   "Do you not remember this phrase of Reb Alsem's: 'We live out the dream of creation, which is God's dream. In the evening our own dreams snuggle down into it like sparrows in their nests.'
    "And did not Reb Hames write: 'Birds of night, my dreams explore the immense dream of the sleeping universe.'"
    "Are dreams the limpid discourse between the facets of a crystal block?" continued Reb Ephraim. "The world is of glass. You know it by its brilliance, night or day."
    "The earth turns in a mirror. The earth turns in a scarf," replied Reb Alphandery.
    "The scarf of a dandy with a nasty scar," said Reb Ephraim.


                      ("Words are inside breath, as the earth is inside time."
                                                                           - Reb Mares)


    And Yukel said:

    "The bundle of the Wandering Jew contains the earth and more than one star."

    "Whatever contains is itself contained," said Reb Mawas.

    The story I told you, as well as the commentaries it inspired, will be recorded in the book of the eye. The ladder urges us beyond ourselves. Hence its importance. But in a void, where do we place it?



                                                                            ("God is sculpted."

Summoned by conscious recollection, she
would be smiling, they might be in a kitchen talking,
before or after dinner. But they are in this other room,
the window has many small panes, and they are on a couch
embracing. He holds her as tightly   
as he can, she buries herself in his body.
Morning, maybe it is evening, light
is flowing through the room. Outside,
the day is slowly succeeded by night,
succeeded by day. The process wobbles wildly
and accelerates: weeks, months, years. The light in the room
does not change, so it is plain what is happening.
They are trying to become one creature,
and something will not have it. They are tender
with each other, afraid
their brief, sharp cries will reconcile them to the moment
when they fall away again. So they rub against each other,
their mouths dry, then wet, then dry.
They feel themselves at the center of a powerful
and baffled will. They feel
they are an almost animal,
washed up on the shore of a world—
or huddled against the gate of a garden—
to which they can’t admit they can never be admitted.

Alexandria, 1956, after the nationalization
of the Suez Canal and all foreign capital



Perhaps her cook, come under the influence
Of a few discreet piastres, had spoken
Too indiscreetly. Or just perhaps,
On a hot day along the azure of the Mediterranean,
Rue Fouad bearing a stream of traffic
To Muhammed Ali Square in a riot
Of klaxons and shouts, and the whole city
Gleaming white as it must have from a distance,
Perhaps on such a day, someone got lucky
And Mme. Sperides at the customs house
Could sense what price she would have to pay,
That the official full of apologies
And gold teeth would usher her into
A private room smelling of dark tobacco,
That under the drone of the ceiling fans
Her valises would be searched, the linings
Cut out, the cowhide ripped back,
That despite her protests which would be
Useless but obligatory, she herself
Would be stripped, that finally,
Two large diamonds worth a modest villa
Would peek and shine from the elegant crack
Of her ass.
                  Whatever the story,
It was not for a boy to know.
I listened at my grandmother’s door
As she spoke in a whisper, thieving
A fragment here a word there naked
Jewels   hidden you know where

It’s autumn in the country I remember.
How warm a wind blew here about the ways!And shadows on the hillside lay to slumberDuring the long sun-sweetened summer-days.
It’s cold abroad the country I remember.
The swallows veering skimmed the golden grainAt midday with a wing aslant and limber;And yellow cattle browsed upon the plain.
It’s empty down the country I remember.
I had a sister lovely in my sight:Her hair was dark, her eyes were very sombre;We sang together in the woods at night.
It’s lonely in the country I remember.
The babble of our children fills my ears,And on our hearth I stare the perished emberTo flames that show all starry thro’ my tears.
It’s dark about the country I remember.
There are the mountains where I lived. The pathIs slushed with cattle-tracks and fallen timber,The stumps are twisted by the tempests’ wrath.
But that I knew these places are my own,I’d ask how came such wretchedness to cumberThe earth, and I to people it alone.
It rains across the country I remember.

It is not the moon, I tell you.
It is these flowers
lighting the yard. 
I hate them.
I hate them as I hate sex,
the man’s mouth
sealing my mouth, the man’s
paralyzing body— 
and the cry that always escapes,
the low, humiliating
premise of union— 
In my mind tonight
I hear the question and pursuing answer
fused in one sound
that mounts and mounts and then
is split into the old selves,
the tired antagonisms. Do you see?
We were made fools of.
And the scent of mock orange
drifts through the window. 
How can I rest?
How can I be content
when there is still
that odor in the world?

I swive as well as others do, I’m young, not yet deformed, My tender heart, sincere, and true, Deserves not to be scorned.  Why Phyllis then, why will you swive, With forty lovers more? Can I (said she) with Nature strive, Alas I am, alas I am a whore.  Were all my body larded o’er, With darts of love, so thick, That you might find in ev’ry pore, A well stuck standing prick; Whilst yet my eyes alone were free, My heart, would never doubt, In am’rous rage, and ecstasy, To wish those eyes, to wish those eyes fucked out.

And what is love? It is a doll dress’d upFor idleness to cosset, nurse, and dandle;A thing of soft misnomers, so divineThat silly youth doth think to make itselfDivine by loving, and so goes on Yawning and doting a whole summer long,Till Miss’s comb is made a pearl tiara,And common Wellingtons turn Romeo boots;Then Cleopatra lives at number seven,And Antony resides in Brunswick Square.Fools! if some passions high have warm’d the world,If Queens and Soldiers have play’d deep for hearts, It is no reason why such agoniesShould be more common than the growth of weeds.Fools! make me whole again that weighty pearlThe Queen of Egypt melted, and I’ll say That ye may love in spite of beaver hats.

He felt the wild beast in him betweenwhilesSo masterfully rude, that he would grieveTo see the helpless delicate thing receiveHis guardianship through certain dark defiles.Had he not teeth to rend, and hunger too?But still he spared her. Once: ‘Have you no fear?’He said: ’twas dusk; she in his grasp; none near.She laughed: ‘No, surely; am I not with you?’And uttering that soft starry ‘you,’ she leanedHer gentle body near him, looking up;And from her eyes, as from a poison-cup,He drank until the flittering eyelids screened.Devilish malignant witch! and oh, young beamOf heaven’s circle-glory! Here they shapeTo squeeze like an intoxicating grape – I might, and yet thou goest safe, supreme.

Yet it was plain she struggled, and that saltOf righteous feeling made her pitiful.Poor twisting worm, so queenly beautiful!Where came the cleft between us? whose the fault?My tears are on thee, that have rarely droppedAs balm for any bitter wound of mine:My breast will open for thee at a sign!But, no: we are two reed-pipes, coarsely stopped:The God once filled them with his mellow breath;And they were music till he flung them down,Used! used! Hear now the discord-loving clownPuff his gross spirit in them, worse than death!I do not know myself without thee more:In this unholy battle I grow base:If the same soul be under the same face, Speak, and a taste of that old time restore!

He found her by the ocean’s moaning verge,Nor any wicked change in her discerned;And she believed his old love had returned,Which was her exultation, and her scourge.She took his hand, and walked with him, and seemedThe wife he sought, though shadow-like and dry.She had one terror, lest her heart should sigh,And tell her loudly that she no longer dreamed.She dared not say, ‘This is my breast: look in.’But there’s a strength to help the desperate weak.That night he learned how silence best can speakThe awful things when Pity pleads for Sin.About the middle of the night her call Was heard, and he came wondering to the bed.‘Now kiss me, dear! it may be, now!’ she said.Lethe had passed those lips, and he knew all.

Their sense is with their senses all mixed in,Destroyed by subtleties these women are!More brain, O Lord, more brain! or we shall marUtterly this fair garden we might win.Behold! I looked for peace, and thought it near.Our inmost hearts had opened, each to each.We drank the pure daylight of honest speech.Alas! that was the fatal draught, I fear.For when of my lost Lady came the word, This woman, O this agony of flesh!Jealous devotion bade her break the mesh,That I might seek that other like a bird.I do adore the nobleness! despise The act! She has gone forth, I know not where.Will the hard world my sentience of her share?I feel the truth; so let the world surmise.

The lowest trees have tops, the ant her gall,
 The fly her spleen, the little sparks their heat;The slender hairs cast shadows, though but small,
 And bees have stings, although they be not great;Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs;And love is love, in beggars as in kings.
Where rivers smoothest run, deep are the fords;
 The dial stirs, yet none perceives it move;The firmest faith is in the fewest words;
 The turtles cannot sing, and yet they love:True hearts have eyes and ears, no tongues to speak;They hear and see, and sigh, and then they break.

At quite uncertain times and places,       The atoms left their heavenly path, And by fortuitous embraces,       Engendered all that being hath. And though they seem to cling together,       And form “associations” here, Yet, soon or late, they burst their tether,       And through the depths of space career.  So we who sat, oppressed with science,       As British asses, wise and grave, Are now transformed to wild Red Lions,       As round our prey we ramp and rave. Thus, by a swift metamorphosis,       Wisdom turns wit, and science joke, Nonsense is incense to our noses,       For when Red Lions speak, they smoke.  Hail, Nonsense! dry nurse of Red Lions,       From thee the wise their wisdom learn, From thee they cull those truths of science,       Which into thee again they turn. What combinations of ideas,       Nonsense alone can wisely form! What sage has half the power that she has,       To take the towers of Truth by storm?  Yield, then, ye rules of rigid reason!       Dissolve, thou too, too solid sense! Melt into nonsense for a season,       Then in some nobler form condense. Soon, all too soon, the chilly morning,       This flow of soul will crystallize, Then those who Nonsense now are scorning,       May learn, too late, where wisdom lies.

I like to think about the monastery
as I’m falling asleep, so that it comes
and goes in my mind like a screen saver.
I conjure the lake of the zendo,
rows of dark boats still unless
someone coughs or otherwise
ripples the calm.
I can hear the four AM slipperiness
of sleeping bags as people turn over
in their bunks. The ancient bells. 
When I was first falling in love with Zen,
I burned incense called Kyonishiki,
“Kyoto Autumn Leaves,”
made by the Shoyeido Incense Company,
Kyoto, Japan. To me it smelled like
earnestness and ether, and I tried to imagine
a consciousness ignorant of me.
I just now lit a stick of it. I had to run downstairs
for some rice to hold it upright in its bowl,
which had been empty for a while,
a raku bowl with two fingerprints
in the clay. It calls up the monastery gate,
the massive door demanding I recommit myself
in the moments of both its opening
and its closing, its weight now mine,
I wanted to know what I was,
and thought I could find the truth
where the floor hurts the knee. 
I understand no one I consider to be religious.
I have no idea what’s meant when someone says
they’ve been intimate with a higher power.
I seem to have been born without a god receptor.
I have fervor but seem to lack
even the basic instincts of the many seekers,
mostly men, I knew in the monastery,
sitting zazen all night,
wearing their robes to near-rags
boy-stitched back together with unmatched thread,
smoothed over their laps and tucked under,
unmoving in the long silence,
the field of grain ripening, heavy tasseled,
field of sentient beings turned toward candles,
flowers, the Buddha gleaming
like a vivid little sports car from his niche. 
What is the mind that precedes
any sense we could possibly have
of ourselves, the mind of self-ignorance?
I thought that the divestiture of self
could be likened to the divestiture
of words, but I was wrong.
It’s not the same work.
One’s a transparency
and one’s an emptiness.  Kyonishiki.... Today I’m painting what Mom
calls no-colors, grays and browns,
evergreens: what’s left of the woods
when autumn’s come and gone.
And though he died, Dad’s here,
still forgetting he’s no longer
married to Annie,
that his own mother is dead,
that he no longer owns a car.
I told them not to make any trouble
or I’d send them both home.
Surprise half inch of snow.
What good are words? 
And what about birches in moonlight,
Russell handing me the year’s
first chanterelle—
Shouldn’t God feel like that? 
I aspire to “a self-forgetful,
perfectly useless concentration,”
as Elizabeth Bishop put it.
So who shall I say I am?
I’m a prism, an expressive temporary
sentience, a pinecone falling.
I can hear my teacher saying, No.
That misses it.

an introductory lecture



This morning we shall spend a few minutes
Upon the study of symbolism, which is basic
To the nature of money. I show you this nickel.
Icons and cryptograms are written all over
The nickel: one side shows a hunchbacked bison
Bending his head and curling his tail to accommodate
The circular nature of money. Over him arches UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and, squinched in
Between that and his rump, E PLURIBUS UNUM,
A Roman reminiscence that appears to mean
An indeterminately large number of things
All of which are the same. Under the bison
A straight line giving him a ground to stand on
Reads FIVE CENTS. And on the other side of our nickel
There is the profile of a man with long hair
And a couple of feathers in the hair; we know
Somehow that he is an American Indian, and
He wears the number nineteen-thirty-six.
Right in front of his eyes the word LIBERTY, bent
To conform with the curve of the rim, appears
To be falling out of the sky Y first; the Indian
Keeps his eyes downcast and does not notice this;
To notice it, indeed, would be shortsighted of him.
So much for the iconography of one of our nickels,
Which is now becoming a rarity and something of
A collectors’ item: for as a matter of fact
There is almost nothing you can buy with a nickel,
The representative American Indian was destroyed
A hundred years or so ago, and his descendants’
Relations with liberty are maintained with reservations,
Or primitive concentration camps; while the bison,
Except for a few examples kept in cages,
Is now extinct. Something like that, I think,
Is what Keats must have meant in his celebrated
Ode on a Grecian Urn.
                               Notice, in conclusion,
A number of circumstances sometimes overlooked
Even by experts: (a) Indian and bison,
Confined to obverse and reverse of the coin,
Can never see each other; (b) they are looking
In opposite directions, the bison past
The Indian’s feathers, the Indian past
The bison’s tail; (c) they are upside down
To one another; (d) the bison has a human face
Somewhat resembling that of Jupiter Ammon.
I hope that our studies today will have shown you
Something of the import of symbolism
With respect to the understanding of what is symbolized.

                    The children are eating lunch at home on a summer weekday when a man comes to the door and asks their mother if she has anything that needs fixing or carrying or any yardwork he can do. They chew their food a little dreamily as, with her back straight and her voice carefully polite, she says No, thank you, I’m sorry, and the man goes away. Who was that, Mama? they say. Oh, no one, she says.
       They are sitting down to dinner but they have to wait because the doorbell rings and a thin young boy begins to tell their father about a Sales Program he’s completing for a scholarship to be Supervisor, and he holds up a filthy tattered little booklet and lifts also his desperate guile and heavily guarded hope, and the children’s father says, No thank you, sorry but I can’t help you out this time, and the boy goes away. The children start to eat and don’t ask anything, because the boy was just a boy, but their father acts irritated and hasty when he sits back down.
      Once a glassy-eyed heavy girl who almost seems asleep as she stands outside their door offers for sale some little handtowels stitched by the blind people at the Lighthouse for the Blind and the children are in the folds of their mother’s full skirt listening to the girl’s small voice and their mother says, Well, I bought some the last time.
      She buys the children school supplies and food, she pays the two boys for mowing the yard together and weeding her flower bed. She gets a new sewing machine for her birthday from the children’s father, and she buys fabric and thread and patterns and makes dresses for the girls, to save money. She tells the children each to put a dime or quarter into the collection plate at Church, and once a month she puts in a little sealed white envelope, and the ushers move slowly along the ends of the pews weaving the baskets through the congregation, and the organist plays a long piece of music.
      Whisk brooms, magazine subscriptions, anything you need hauled away, little league raffle tickets, cookies, chocolate candy, can I do any yard work again and again, hairbrushes, Christmas cards, do you need help with your ironing one time, and more, came calling at the front door while the children were sometimes eating, sometimes playing. Their faces would soften with a kind of comfort in the authority of mother or father, with a kind of wonder at the needy callers.
      Their father left for work every day early, and came home for dinner, and almost always went again on Saturday; in his car. Their mother opened a savings account for each child and into each put the first five dollars. The children felt proud to see their names in the passbooks, and wanted to know when they could take the money out. But they were told they had to save their money not spend it. They felt a kind of pleasure in these mysteries, to know that there were things you would understand later when you grew up and had your own house and while your children were eating their dinner and making too much noise the way you did, you knew it was true, the doorbell would ring, the familiar surprise of it, who would it be, and someone would be holding a little worn book or a bundle of dishtowels or once an old man, but perhaps he only looked old, with his beard, came with bunches of carnations, white, red, and pink, and he too was turned away.

Quarterly, is it, money reproaches me:
    ‘Why do you let me lie here wastefully?
I am all you never had of goods and sex.
    You could get them still by writing a few cheques.’ 
So I look at others, what they do with theirs:   
    They certainly don’t keep it upstairs.
By now they’ve a second house and car and wife:
    Clearly money has something to do with life 
—In fact, they’ve a lot in common, if you enquire:
    You can’t put off being young until you retire,
And however you bank your screw, the money you save
    Won’t in the end buy you more than a shave. 
I listen to money singing. It’s like looking down
    From long french windows at a provincial town,   
The slums, the canal, the churches ornate and mad
    In the evening sun. It is intensely sad.


^^EOP^^

You’re rich, lady, hissed the young woman at
My mother as she bent in her garden. Look at what you’ve got, and it was
Too much, the collards and tomatoes,
A man, however lousy, taking care
of the bills. 
This was the reason for the early deaths
My mother was to find from that point on,
Turned dirt and the mock of roots,
Until finally, she gave her garden up. You can’t have nothing, she tells us,
Is the motto of our neighborhood,
These modest houses
That won’t give an inch.


^^EOP^^

To have known him, to have loved him
   After loneness long;And then to be estranged in life,
   And neither in the wrong;And now for death to set his seal—
   Ease me, a little ease, my song!By wintry hills his hermit-mound
   The sheeted snow-drifts drape,And houseless there the snow-bird flits
   Beneath the fir-trees’ crape:Glazed now with ice the cloistral vine
   That hid the shyest grape.


^^EOP^^

There are never any suicides in the quarter among people one knows No successful suicides. A Chinese boy kills himself and is dead. (they continue to place his mail in the letter rack at the Dome) A Norwegian boy kills himself and is dead. (no one knows where the other Norwegian boy has gone) They find a model dead alone in bed and very dead. (it made almost unbearable trouble for the concierge) Sweet oil, the white of eggs, mustard and water, soap suds and stomach pumps rescue the people one knows. Every afternoon the people one knows can be found at the café.

Now, it’s all right now   
even to fall asleep
just as on all those nights.   
—Suddenly the bus driver   
stops with a jolt,
turns off his lights. 
A moose has come out of

in the middle of the road.
It approaches; it sniffs at
the bus’s hot hood. 
Towering, antlerless,

childishly, softly,
“Sure are big creatures.”   
“It’s awful plain.”   
“Look! It’s a she!” 
Taking her time,
she looks the bus over,   
grand, otherworldly.   
Why, why do we feel   
(we all feel) this sweet   
sensation of joy? 
“Curious creatures,”
says our quiet driver,   
rolling his r’s.
“Look at that, would you.”   
Then he shifts gears.
For a moment longer, 
by craning backward,   
the moose can be seen
on the moonlit macadammacadam Road, pavement;   
then there’s a dim
smell of moose, an acridacrid Pungent, irritating   
smell of gasoline.

At four in the morning he wakes   
to the yawn of brakes,
the snore of a diesel engine.   
Gone. All she left
is a froth of bra and panties.   
The scum of the Seine
and the Farset.
Gallogly squats in his own pelt.   
A sodium street light
has brought a new dimension   
to their black taxi.
By the time they force an entry   
he’ll have skedaddled
among hen runs and pigeon lofts. 
The charter flight from Florida   
touched down at Aldergrove   
minutes earlier,
at 3.54 a.m.
Its excess baggage takes the form
of Mangas Jones, Esquire,   
who is, as it turns out, Apache.   
He carries only hand luggage.   
‘Anything to declare?’
He opens the powder-blue attaché-
case. ‘A pebble of quartz.’   
‘You’re an Apache?’ ‘Mescalero.’
He follows the corridor’s   
arroyo till the signs read Hertz. 
He is going to put his foot down   
on a patch of waste ground
along the Stranmillis embankment   
when he gets wind
of their impromptu fire.
The air above the once-sweet stream   
is aquarium-
drained.
And six, maybe seven, skinheads   
have formed a quorum
round a burnt-out heavy-duty tyre.   
So intent on sniffing glue
they may not notice Gallogly,
or, if they do, are so far gone. 
Three miles west as the crow flies
an all-night carry-out   
provides the cover
for an illegal drinking club.
While the bar man unpacks a crate
of Coca-Cola,
one cool customer
takes on all comers in a video game.
He grasps what his two acolytes
have failed to seize.
Don’t they know what kind of take-away   
this is, the glipes?
Vietmanese. Viet-ma-friggin’-knees.
He drops his payload of napalm. 
Gallogly is wearing a candy-stripe   
king-size sheet,
a little something he picked up   
off a clothes line.
He is driving a milk van
he borrowed from the Belfast Co-op   
while the milkman’s back
was turned.
He had given the milkman a playful   
rabbit punch.
When he stepped on the gas
he flooded the street
with broken glass.
He is trying to keep a low profile. 
The unmarked police car draws level   
with his last address.
A sergeant and eight constables   
pile out of a tender
and hammer up the stairs.
The street bristles with static.
Their sniffer dog, a Labrador bitch,   
bursts into the attic
like David Balfour in Kidnapped. 
A constable on his first dawn swoop   
leans on a shovel.
He has turned over a
new leaf in her ladyship’s herb patch.   
They’ll take it back for analysis. 
All a bit much after the night shift   
to meet a milkman
who’s double-parked his van
closing your front door after him.
He’s sporting your
Donegal tweed suit and your
Sunday shoes and politely raises your   
hat as he goes by.
You stand there with your mouth open   
as he climbs into the still-warm
driving seat of your Cortina
and screeches off towards the motorway,   
leaving you uncertain
of your still-warm wife’s damp tuft. 
Someone on their way to early Mass   
will find her hog-tied
to the chapel gates—
O Child of Prague-
big-eyed, anorexic.
The lesson for today
is pinned to her bomber jacket.
It seems to read Keep off the Grass.
Her lovely head has been chopped   
and changed.
For Beatrice, whose fathers
knew Louis Quinze,
to have come to this, her perruque   
of tar and feathers. 
He is pushing the maroon Cortina   
through the sedge
on the banks of the Callan.
It took him a mere forty minutes   
to skite up the Ml.
He followed the exit sign
for Loughgall and hared
among the top-heavy apple orchards.
This stretch of the Armagh/Tyrone   
border was planted by Warwickshiremen   
who planted in turn
their familiar quick-set damson hedges.   
The Cortina goes to the bottom.
Gallogly swallows a plummy-plum-plum. 
‘I’ll warrant them’s the very pair
o’ boys I seen abroad
in McParland’s bottom, though where
in under God— for thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate— 
where they come from God only knows.’   
‘They were mad for a bite o’ mate,
I s’pose.’
‘I doubt so. I come across a brave dale
o’ half-chawed damsels. Wanst wun disappeared   
I follied the wun as yelly as Indy male.’
‘Ye weren’t afeared?’
‘I follied him.’ ‘God save us.’
‘An’ he driv away in a van belongin’ t’Avis.’ 
The grass sprightly as Astroturf   
in the September frost
and a mist
here where the ground is low
He seizes his own wrist
as if, as if
Blind Pew again seized Jim
at the sign of the ‘Admiral Benbow’.   
As if Jim Hawkins led Blind Pew   
to Billy Bones
and they were all one and the same,   
he stares in disbelief
at an aspirin-white spot he pressed   
into his own palm. 
Gallogly’s thorn-proof tweed jacket
is now several sizes too big.   
He has flopped
down in a hay shed
to ram a wad of hay into the toe   
of each of his ill-fitting   
brogues, when he gets the drift   
of ham and eggs.
Now he’s led by his own wet nose   
to the hacienda-style
farmhouse, a baggy-kneed animated
bear drawn out of the woods   
by an apple pie
left to cool on a windowsill. 
She was standing at the picture window   
with a glass of water
and a Valium
when she caught your man   
in the reflection of her face.   
He came
shaping past the milking parlour   
as if he owned the place.
Such is the integrity
of their quarrel
that she immediately took down   
the legally held shotgun
and let him have both barrels.
She had wanted only to clear the air. 
Half a mile away across the valley   
her husband’s U.D.R. patrol
is mounting a check-point.
He pricks up his ears
at the crack
of her prematurely arthritic hip-
joint,
and commandeers one of the jeeps.
There now, only a powder burn   
as if her mascara had run.
The bloody puddle
in the yard, and the shilly-shally   
of blood like a command wire   
petering out behind a milk churn. 
A hole in the heart, an ovarian   
cyst.
Coming up the Bann
in a bubble.
Disappearing up his own bum.   
Or, running on the spot
with all the minor aplomb   
of a trick-cyclist.
So thin, side-on, you could spit   
through him.
His six foot of pump water   
bent double
in agony or laughter.
Keeping down-wind of everything.  White Annetts. Gillyflowers. Angel Bites.
When he names the forgotten names   
of apples
he has them all off pat.
His eye like the eye of a travelling rat   
lights on the studied negligence
of these scraws of turf.
A tarpaulin. A waterlogged pit.
He will take stock of the Kalashnikov’s   
filed-down serial number,
seven sticks of unstable
commercial gelignite
that have already begun to weep. Red Strokes. Sugar Sweet. Widows Whelps.   
Buy him a drink and he’ll regale you   
with how he came in for a cure   
one morning after the night before
to the Las Vegas Lounge and Cabaret.   
He was crossing the bar’s
eternity of parquet floor
when his eagle eye
saw something move on the horizon.   
If it wasn’t an Indian.
A Sioux. An ugly Sioux.
He means, of course, an Oglala   
Sioux busily tracing the family tree   
of an Ulsterman who had some hand   
in the massacre at Wounded Knee. 
He will answer the hedge-sparrow’s    Littlebitofbreadandnocheese 
with a whole bunch
of freshly picked watercress,   
a bulb of garlic,
sorrel,
with many-faceted blackberries.   
Gallogly is out to lunch.
When his cock rattles its sabre   
he takes it in his dab
hand, plants one chaste kiss   
on its forelock,
and then, with a birl and a skirl,   
tosses it off like a caber. 
The U.D.R. corporal had come off duty   
to be with his wife
while the others set about
a follow-up search.
When he tramped out just before twelve   
to exercise the greyhound
he was hit by a single high-velocity   
shot.
You could, if you like, put your fist   
in the exit wound
in his chest.
He slumps
in the spume of his own arterial blood   
like an overturned paraffin lamp. 
Gallogly lies down in the sheugh   
to munch
through a Beauty of
Bath. He repeats himself, Bath,
under his garlic-breath. Sheugh, he says. Sheugh.
He is finding that first ‘sh’
increasingly difficult to manage.    Sh-leeps. A milkmaid sinks   
her bare foot
to the ankle
in a simmering dung hill
and fills the slot
with beastlings for him to drink. 
In Ovid’s conspicuously tongue-in-cheek   
account of an eyeball
to eyeball
between the goddess Leto
and a shower of Lycian reed cutters   
who refuse her a cup of cloudy
water
from their churned-up lake, Live then forever in that lake of yours,   
she cries, and has them
bubble
and squeak
and plonk themselves down as bullfrogs   
In their icy jissom. 
A country man kneels on his cap
beside his neighbour’s fresh
grave-mud
as Gallogly kneels to lap   
the primrose-yellow   
custard.
The knees of his hand-me-down duds
are gingerish.
A pernickety seven-
year-old girl-child
parades in her mother’s trousseau
and mumbles a primrose   
Kleenex tissue
to make sure her lipstick’s even. 
Gallogly has only to part the veil   
of its stomach wall
to get right under the skin,
the spluttering heart
and collapsed lung,
of the horse in Guernica.
He flees the Museum of Modern Art   
with its bit between his teeth.
When he began to cough
blood, Hamsun rode the Minneapolis/   
New York night train
on top of the dining-car.
One long, inward howl.
A porter-drinker without a thrapple. 
A weekend trip to the mountains
north of Boston   
with Alice, Alice A.   
and her paprika hair,
the ignition key
to her family’s Winnebago camper,
her quim
biting the leg off her.
In the oyster bar
of Grand Central Station
she gobbles a dozen Chesapeakes—
‘Oh, I’m not particular as to size’—
and, with a flourish of Tabasco,   
turns to gobble him. 
A brewery lorry on a routine delivery   
is taking a slow,
dangerous bend.
The driver’s blethering
his code name
over the Citizens Band
when someone ambles
in front of him. Go, Johnny, go, go, go.   
He’s been dry-gulched
by a sixteen-year-old numb
with Mogadon,
whose face is masked by the seamless   
black stocking filched
from his mum. 
When who should walk in but Beatrice,   
large as life, or larger,
sipping her one glass of lager   
and singing her one song.
If he had it to do all over again   
he would let her shave his head   
in memory of ’98
and her own, the French, Revolution.   
The son of the King of the Moy   
met this child on the Roxborough   
estate. Noblesse, she said. Noblesse  oblige. And her tiny nipples   
were bruise-bluish, wild raspberries.
The song she sang was ‘The Croppy Boy’. 
Her grand’mère was once asked to tea   
by Gertrude Stein,
and her grand’mère and Gertrude   
and Alice B., chère Alice B.
with her hook-nose,
the three of them sat in the nude   
round the petits fours
and repeated Eros is Eros is Eros. 
If he had it to do all over again   
he would still be taken in
by her Alice B. Toklas
Nameless Cookies
and those new words she had him learn:   
hash, hashish, lo perfido assassin. 
Once the local councillor straps   
himself into the safety belt
of his Citroën
and skids up the ramp
from the municipal car park
he upsets the delicate balance   
of a mercury-tilt
boobytrap.
Once they collect his smithereens   
he doesn’t quite add up.
They’re shy of a foot, and a calf   
which stems
from his left shoe like a severely   
pruned-back shrub. 
Ten years before. The smooth-as-a
front-lawn at Queen’s
where she squats
before a psilocybin god.
The indomitable gentle-bush
that had Lanyon or Lynn
revise their elegant ground plan   
for the university quad. With calmness, with care,
with breast milk, with dew.
There’s no cure now.
There’s nothing left to do.

for Heinrich Blücher and Hannah Arendt



Composed in the Tower before his execution
These moving verses, and being brought at that time   
Painfully to the stake, submitted, declaring thus:
“I implore my God to witness that I have made no crime.” 
Nor was he forsaken of courage, but the death was horrible,   
The sack of gunpowder failing to ignite.
His legs were blistered sticks on which the black sap   
Bubbled and burst as he howled for the Kindly Light. 
And that was but one, and by no means one of the worst;   
Permitted at least his pitiful dignity;
And such as were by made prayers in the name of Christ,   
That shall judge all men, for his soul’s tranquillity. 
We move now to outside a German wood.   
Three men are there commanded to dig a hole   
In which the two Jews are ordered to lie down   
And be buried alive by the third, who is a Pole. 
Not light from the shrine at Weimar beyond the hill   
Nor light from heaven appeared. But he did refuse.   
A Lüger settled back deeply in its glove.
He was ordered to change places with the Jews. 
Much casual death had drained away their souls.   
The thick dirt mounted toward the quivering chin.   
When only the head was exposed the order came   
To dig him out again and to get back in. 
No light, no light in the blue Polish eye.
When he finished a riding boot packed down the earth.   
The Lüger hovered lightly in its glove.
He was shot in the belly and in three hours bled to death. 
No prayers or incense rose up in those hours
Which grew to be years, and every day came mute   
Ghosts from the ovens, sifting through crisp air,   
And settled upon his eyes in a black soot.

(1942)

To Denis Devlin



I 
Again the native hour lets down the locks   
Uncombed and black, but gray the bobbing beard;   
Ten years ago His eyes, fierce shuttlecocks,   
Pierced the close net of what I failed: I feared   
The belly-cold, the grave-clout, that betrayed   
Me dithering in the drift of cordial seas;
Ten years are time enough to be dismayed
By mummy Christ, head crammed between his knees.    
Suppose I take an arrogant bomber, stroke   
By stroke, up to the frazzled sun to hear   
Sun-ghostlings whisper: Yes, the capital yoke—
Remove it and there’s not a ghost to fear   
This crucial day, whose decapitate joke   
Languidly winds into the inner ear.   II 
The day’s at end and there’s nowhere to go,   
Draw to the fire, even this fire is dying;   
Get up and once again politely lying
Invite the ladies toward the mistletoe
With greedy eyes that stare like an old crow.   
How pleasantly the holly wreaths did hang   
And how stuffed Santa did his reindeer clang   
Above the golden oaken mantel, years ago!  
Then hang this picture for a calendar,
As sheep for goat, and pray most fixedly   
For the cold martial progress of your star,   
With thoughts of commerce and society,   
Well-milked Chinese, Negroes who cannot sing,   
The Huns gelded and feeding in a ring.   III 
Give me this day a faith not personal
As follows: The American people fully armed   
With assurance policies, righteous and harmed,   
Battle the world of which they’re not at all.   
That lying boy of ten who stood in the hall,   
His hat in hand (thus by his father charmed:   
“You may be President”), was not alarmed   
Nor even left uneasy by his fall.  
Nobody said that he could be a plumber,   
Carpenter, clerk, bus-driver, bombardier;   
Let little boys go into violent slumber,   
Aegean squall and squalor where their fear   
Is of an enemy in remote oceans
Unstalked by Christ: these are the better notions.   IV 
Gay citizen, myself, and thoughtful friend,   
Your ghosts are Plato’s Christians in the cave.   
Unfix your necks, turn to the door; the nave   
Gives back the cheated and light dividend
So long sequestered; now, new-rich, you’ll spend   
Flesh for reality inside a stone
Whose light obstruction, like a gossamer bone,   
Dead or still living, will not break or bend.  
Thus light, your flesh made pale and sinister   
And put off like a dog that’s had his day,   
You will be Plato’s kept philosopher,
Albino man bleached from the mortal clay,   
Mild-mannered, gifted in your master’s ease   
While the sun squats upon the waveless seas.

Morning arrives
unannounced
by limousine: the tall   
emaciated chairman 
of sleeplessness in person
steps out on the sidewalk
and donning black glasses, ascends   
the stairs to your building 
guided by a German shepherd.   
After a couple faint knocks   
at the door, he slowly opens   
the book of blank pages 
pointing out
with a pale manicured finger   
particular clauses,
proof of your guilt.

Christ, whose glory fills the skies,
   Christ, the true, the only light,Sun of Righteousness, arise,
   Triumph o’er the shades of night:Day-spring from on high, be near:Day-star, in my heart appear.
Dark and cheerless is the morn
   Unaccompanied by thee,Joyless is the day’s return,
   Till thy mercy’s beams I see;Till thy inward light impart,Glad my eyes, and warm my heart.
Visit then this soul of mine,
   Pierce the gloom of sin, and grief,Fill me, Radiancy Divine,
   Scatter all my unbelief,More and more thyself display,Shining to the perfect day.

Love set you going like a fat gold watch.
The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry   
Took its place among the elements. 
Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.
In a drafty museum, your nakedness
Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls. 
I’m no more your mother
Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow
Effacement at the wind’s hand. 
All night your moth-breath
Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:
A far sea moves in my ear. 
One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral
In my Victorian nightgown.
Your mouth opens clean as a cat’s. The window square 
Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try
Your handful of notes;
The clear vowels rise like balloons.

—for Melissa L. Whiteman



“Hi, guy,” said I to a robin
perched on a pole in the middle
of the garden. Pink and yellow
firecracker zinnias, rough green
leaves of broccoli,
and deep red tomatoes on dying stems
frame his still presence. 
“I’ve heard you’re not
THE REAL ROBIN. Bird watchers have
agreed,” I said. “THE REAL ROBIN
lives in England. They claim
your are misnamed and that we ought
to call you ‘a red-breasted thrush’
because you are
indigenous.” 
He fluffed up. “Am I not Jis ko ko?” he cried, “that persistent
warrior who carries warmth
northward every spring?”
He seemed so young, his red belly
a bit light and his wings, still
faded brown. He watched me
untangling the hose to water squash. 
“Look who’s talking!” he chirruped.
“Your people didn’t come
from Europe or even India.
The turtles say you’re a relative
to red clay on this great island.”
Drops of crystal water
sparkled on the squash. 
“Indigenous!” he teased
as he flew by.

O joys! infinite sweetness! with what flow’rsAnd shoots of glory my soul breaks and buds!
         All the long hours
         Of night, and rest,
         Through the still shrouds
         Of sleep, and clouds,
    This dew fell on my breast;
    Oh, how it bloodsAnd spirits all my earth! Hark! In what ringsAnd hymning circulations the quick world
         Awakes and sings;
         The rising winds
         And falling springs,
         Birds, beasts, all things
    Adore him in their kinds.
         Thus all is hurl’dIn sacred hymns and order, the great chimeAnd symphony of nature. Prayer is
         The world in tune,
         A spirit voice,
         And vocal joys
    Whose echo is heav’n’s bliss.
         O let me climbWhen I lie down! The pious soul by nightIs like a clouded star whose beams, though said
         To shed their light
         Under some cloud,
         Yet are above,
         And shine and move
    Beyond that misty shroud.
         So in my bed,That curtain’d grave, though sleep, like ashes, hideMy lamp and life, both shall in thee abide.

The tortures of lumbago consumed Aunt Madge,
And Leah Vest, once resigned from schoolmarming,
Could not be convinced to leave the house,
And Mrs. Mary Hogan, after birthing her fifth son, 
Lay bedfast for the last fifty-two years of her life,
Reporting shooting pains that would begin
High in her back and shear downward to the feet,
As though, she said, she had been glazed in lightning; 
And also, men, broken on bridges and mills,
Shell-shocked veterans, religious alcoholics—
Leldon Kilpatrick, Johnson Suggs, Whitey Carlyle:
They came and sat there too, leafing through 
Yellowing Pageants and Progressive Farmers;
And, one by one, all entered in and talked
While the good doctor gargled a dark chaff
In his pipe and took down symptoms, 
Annotating them on his hidden chart—
Numbness, neuralgia, the knotted lymph,
The clammy palms—and then he’d scratch
His temple’s meaningful patch of white 
And scrawl out his unfailing barbiturate prescription
To be filled by his pharmacist brother-in-law
Until half the county had gathered as in a lap—
The quantum ache, the mutiny in every house. 
How much pain, how many diseases
Consigned to the mythological, the dropped
Ovaries, the torn-up nerves, what women
Said, what men wanted to believe? Part of it 
Laughable, I know. Still I want someone
To see, now that they lie safe in graves
Beyond the vacant stores, that someone
Listened and, hearing the wrong at the heart, 
Named it something that sounded real, whatever
They lived through and died of. I remember
Mrs. Lyle who called it a thorn in the flesh,
And Mr. Appleton, who had no roof in his mouth.

Most like an arch—an entrance which upholds
and shores the stone-crush up the air like lace.
Mass made idea, and idea held in place.
A lock in time. Inside half-heaven unfolds. 
Most like an arch—two weaknesses that lean
into a strength. Two fallings become firm.
Two joined abeyances become a term
naming the fact that teaches fact to mean. 
Not quite that? Not much less. World as it is,
what’s strong and separate falters. All I do
at piling stone on stone apart from you
is roofless around nothing. Till we kiss 
I am no more than upright and unset.
It is by falling in and in we make
the all-bearing point, for one another’s sake,
in faultless failing, raised by our own weight.


^^EOP^^

I 
“At odds again,”   
hands moving out   
of the shadows.   
And now, now   
everything seems   
definite, discrete,   
fingers webbed   
with sunlight
the tree lets through,   
arms still in their   
own time, circling,   
catch up, catch   
hold at the wrists,   
like cell chains   
in a watchcrystal   
completing themselves.   
Together again.   
Shoulders, torso,   
each one of us one,   
once more. It is   
hard to imagine   
minutes just past.  
II 
“At odds again,”   
hands moving against   
the wind like loose   
flapping things,   
washcloths, words   
long frayed with   
careless use. You   
wanted to say   
it was beginning   
to bother you,   
beginning to wish,   
wondering if thought   
in broken light   
could ever touch   
itself, reassemble   
itself. The King,   
our promise, broken,   
the sword we imagined   
gone, hovers like   
leafmold in the light.   
Say it, then, the stain   
of things remains.  
III 
“At odds again,”
elbow cupped into   
wet leaves. After   
love, there are   
moments of clutter,   
and no amount of   
practice will teach   
you to regard them   
as anything more   
than what you lean   
against catching   
its buried chill.
Keep your fancy   
to yourself; facts   
do not fade but are   
momentarily obscured,   
the work of hands,   
touch and its out-
come, the absence   
of touch, and distance,   
the inevitable space   
between, shapes all   
our limitations.  
IV 
“At odds again,”   
knee raised slightly,   
sunlight and shade,   
patchwork coverlet.   
Bits and pieces,   
the story of each   
thing connected, end   
to end, this instant   
extended in every   
direction. Not a   
thing in space or   
things in spaces or   
spaces between what   
space seems occupied
for this moment, the next.   
We are not snowstorms   
of ourselves, spindrift   
and curl. The whorl   
of action is a template   
in time: the casual   
shifting of leaves,   
hands moving, the certain   
flex of possibility.

We’re all dreamers; we don’t know who we are. 
Some machine made us; machine of the world, the constricting family.
Then back to the world, polished by soft whips. 
We dream; we don’t remember. 
Machine of the family: dark fur, forests of the mother’s body.
Machine of the mother: white city inside her. 
And before that: earth and water.
Moss between rocks, pieces of leaves and grass. 
And before, cells in a great darkness.
And before that, the veiled world. 
This is why you were born: to silence me.
Cells of my mother and father, it is your turn
to be pivotal, to be the masterpiece. 
I improvised; I never remembered.
Now it’s your turn to be driven;
you’re the one who demands to know: 
Why do I suffer? Why am I ignorant?
Cells in a great darkness. Some machine made us;
it is your turn to address it, to go back asking
what am I for? What am I for?

Mother, I cannot mind my wheel;
     My fingers ache, my lips are dry:Oh! if you felt the pain I feel!
     But Oh, who ever felt as I!
No longer could I doubt him true;

     And often swore my lips were sweet.

This is everything she ever closed a door
on, the broom closet of childhood
where no one could ever find a broom.
Here, layer upon layer, nothing breathes:
photo albums curl at the edges, books
she brought home from the library
where she worked, handled by thousands
of other hands before their final exile
where they’ve waited, paper and more paper
taking in the ocean air, about to sprout. 
Mother’s sitting on the bed
with her tattered list of dispersals—who gets
what among the treasures she hopes
I’ll find, but I know I’m seeing
what she doesn't want me to see,
the daughter cleaning doing what the son
would never do. After an hour of excavation
the console TV emerges from beneath
forgotten sweaters and balled up nylons
saved for stuffing puppets, a long ago church project—
the TV arrived in 1966 same day I crushed
the fender of the car, upsetting
the careful plans she’d made for payment. 
She wants to leave so much behind. Hours later
I’ve found nothing I want but the purple mache mask
I made in the fourth grade. I like its yellow eyes.
She looks at each magazine I remove, saving
every word about my brother, the coach. He’s sixty
and a long dead mouse has eaten the laces
of his baby shoes. I want order. I say
I’m old myself, I’ve started throwing things away.
I’m lying. I’ve kept everything she’s ever given me.


^^EOP^^

Well, son, I’ll tell you:
Life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.
It’s had tacks in it,
And splinters,
And boards torn up,
And places with no carpet on the floor—
Bare.
But all the time
I’se been a-climbin’ on,
And reachin’ landin’s,
And turnin’ corners,
And sometimes goin’ in the dark
Where there ain’t been no light.
So boy, don’t you turn back.
Don’t you set down on the steps
’Cause you finds it’s kinder hard.
Don’t you fall now—
For I’se still goin’, honey,
I’se still climbin’,
And life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.


^^EOP^^

She sat on a shelf,
her breasts two bellies
on her poked-out belly,
on which the navel looked
like a sucked-in mouth—
her knees bent and apart,
her long left arm raised,
with the large hand knuckled
to a bar in the ceiling—
her right hand clamping
the skinny infant to her chest—
its round, pale, new,
soft muzzle hunting
in the brown hair for a nipple,
its splayed, tiny hand picking
at her naked, dirty ear.
Twisting its little neck,
with tortured, ecstatic eyes
the size of lentils, it looked
into her severe, close-set,
solemn eyes, that beneath bald
eyelids glared—dull lights
in sockets of leather. 
She twitched some chin-hairs,
with pain or pleasure,
as the baby-mouth found and
yanked at her nipple;
its pink-nailed, jointless
fingers, wandering her face,
tangled in the tufts
of her cliffy brows.
She brought her big
hand down from the bar
with pretended exasperation
unfastened the little hand,
and locked it within her palm—
while her right hand
with snag-nailed forefinger
and short, sharp thumb, raked
the new orange hair
of the infant’s skinny flank—
and found a louse,
which she lipped, and
thoughtfully crisped
between broad teeth.
She wrinkled appreciative
nostrils which, without a nose,
stood open—damp holes
above the poke of her mouth. 
She licked her lips, flicked
her leather eyelids—
then, suddenly flung
up both arms and grabbed
the bars overhead.
The baby's scrabbly fingers
instantly caught the hair—
as if there were metal rings there—
in her long, stretched armpits.
And, as she stately swung,
and then proudly, more swiftly
slung herself from corner
to corner of her cell—
arms longer than her round
body, short knees bent—
her little wild-haired,
poke-mouthed infant hung,
like some sort of trophy,
or decoration, or shaggy medal—
shaped like herself—but new,
clean, soft and shining
on her chest.


^^EOP^^

She came home running
       back to the mothering blackness   
       deep in the smothering blackness
white tears icicle gold plains of her face   
       She came home running 
She came down creeping
       here to the black arms waiting
       now to the warm heart waiting
rime of alien dreams befrosts her rich brown face   
       She came down creeping 
She came home blameless
       black yet as Hagar’s daughter
       tall as was Sheba’s daughter
threats of northern winds die on the desert’s face   
       She came home blameless

the last time i was home
to see my mother we kissed
exchanged pleasantries
and unpleasantries pulled a warm   
comforting silence around
us and read separate books 
i remember the first time
i consciously saw her
we were living in a three room   
apartment on burns avenue 
mommy always sat in the dark
i don’t know how i knew that but she did 
that night i stumbled into the kitchen
maybe because i’ve always been
a night person or perhaps because i had wet
the bed
she was sitting on a chair
the room was bathed in moonlight diffused through   
those thousands of panes landlords who rented
to people with children were prone to put in windows   
she may have been smoking but maybe not
her hair was three-quarters her height
which made me a strong believer in the samson myth   
and very black 
i’m sure i just hung there by the door
i remember thinking: what a beautiful lady 
she was very deliberately waiting
perhaps for my father to come home   
from his night job or maybe for a dream
that had promised to come by   
“come here” she said “i’ll teach you   
a poem: i see the moon
               the moon sees me
               god bless the moon
               and god bless me

Now I have tempered haste,
The joyous traveller said,
The steed has passed me now
Whose hurrying hooves I fled.
My spectre rides thereon,
I learned what mount he has,
Upon what summers fed;
And wept to know again,
Beneath the saddle swung,
Treasure for whose great theft
This breast was wrung.
His bridle bells sang out,
I could not tell their chime,
So brilliantly he rings,
But called his name as Time.
His bin was morning light,
Those straws which gild his bed
Are of the fallen West.
Although green lands consume
Beneath their burning tread,
In everlasting bright
His hooves have rest.

Lord’s lost Him His mockingbird,   
       His fancy warbler;
       Satan sweet-talked her,
       four bullets hushed her.
       Who would have thought
       she’d end that way? 
Four bullets hushed her. And the world a-clang with evil.   
Who’s going to make old hardened sinner men tremble now   
and the righteous rock?         
Oh who and oh who will sing Jesus down
to help with struggling and doing without and being colored   
all through blue Monday?
Till way next Sunday? 
       All those angels
       in their cretonne clouds and finery   
       the true believer saw
       when she rared back her head and sang,   
       all those angels are surely weeping.   
       Who would have thought
       she’d end that way? 
Four holes in her heart. The gold works wrecked.   
But she looks so natural in her big bronze coffin   
among the Broken Hearts and Gates-Ajar,   
it’s as if any moment she’d lift her head
from its pillow of chill gardenias
and turn this quiet into shouting Sunday
and make folks forget what she did on Monday. 
       Oh, Satan sweet-talked her,   
       and four bullets hushed her.   
       Lord’s lost Him His diva,   
       His fancy warbler’s gone.   
       Who would have thought,
       who would have thought she’d end that way?

Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use,
 Did after him the world seduce,And from the fields the flowers and plants allure,
 Where nature was most plain and pure. He first enclosed within the gardens square
 A dead and standing pool of air,And a more luscious earth for them did knead, 
 Which stupified them while it fed.The pink grew then as double as his mind; 
 The nutriment did change the kind.With strange perfumes he did the roses taint,
 And flowers themselves were taught to paint. The tulip, white, did for complexion seek,
 And learned to interline its cheek:Its onion root they then so high did hold, 
 That one was for a meadow sold.Another world was searched, through oceans new, 
 To find the Marvel of Peru.

^^EOP^^

The mower stalled, twice; kneeling, I found   
A hedgehog jammed up against the blades,   
Killed. It had been in the long grass. 
I had seen it before, and even fed it, once.   
Now I had mauled its unobtrusive world   
Unmendably. Burial was no help: 
Next morning I got up and it did not.
The first day after a death, the new absence   
Is always the same; we should be careful 
Of each other, we should be kind   
While there is still time.


^^EOP^^

Sleepy and suburban at dusk,
I learn again the yard’s
geometry, edging around the garden
and the weedy knots of flowers, circling
trees and shrubs, giving
a wide berth to the berry patch,
heavy and sprawled out of its bounds.
Shoving such a machine
around a fairway of dandelions,
it is easy to feel absurd.
The average lawn, left alone
one hundred years, could become
a hardwood forest. An admirable project.
Still I carry on, following week on week
the same mowing pattern, cutting edges,
almost sprinting the last narrow swaths.
And tonight, as I mow over
the bushels of fallen peaches,
sending pits soaring over the neighbors’ fences,
seems hardly any different.
But on one crooked march I walk
across the thin hidden hole
to a yellowjacket hive. The blade pulls
them up from their deep sweet chamber
just as my bare legs go by. 
A bee lands heavily,
all blunder and revenge, and the sting
is a quick embrace and release,
like the dared kid’s run and touch
of a blind man. I’m blind now
with the shock and pain of it,
howling in a sprint toward the house,
the mower flopped on its side, wild blade loose
in the darkening air.
                                 Later,
the motor sputtered quiet, starved by tilt,
I’m back in the twilight,
a half-dozen stings packed in wet tobacco,
carrying a can of gasoline, a five-foot torch.
The destruction is easy: shove can
slow to entranceway lip, pull
back and light torch, use torch
to tip can. One low whump and it’s over.
A few flaming drones flutter out and fall.
Stragglers, late returners, cruise
wide circles around the ruins.
In the cool September night they fly
or die. In the morning I finish my chores. 
All the way to winter the blackened hole
remains. On Christmas Eve a light
late snow covers it and all
the lawn’s other imperfections: crabgrass
hummocks, high maple roots,
the mushroom-laden fairy ring that defies
obliteration and appears every spring
more visible than ever. Standing
in the window, the scent
of pine powerful around me,
the snap of wood undoing itself in the stove,
I wonder at this thin and cold
camouflage, falling,
gradually falling over what has gone
and grown before. And I hear
that other rattle and report, that engine
driven by another fire. I think of a gold
that is sweet and unguent, a gold
that is a blaze of years behind me.
I hear wind in its regular passes
blowing across the roof,
feel in my legs a minute and icy tingling,
as though I have stood too long
in one place or made again another wrong step,
as though the present itself
were a kind of memory, coiled, waiting,
dying to be seen from tomorrow.

I have lately come to the conclusion that I am Eve,
alias Mrs. Adam. You know, there is no account
of her death in the Bible, and why am I not Eve?
Emily Dickinson in a letter,
12 January, 1846



Wake up,
you’ll need your wits about you.
This is not a dream,
but a woman who loves you, speaking. 
She was there
when you cried out;
she brushed the terror away.
She knew
when it was time to sin.
You were wise
to let her handle it,
and leave that place. 
We couldn’t speak at first
for the bitter knowledge,
the sweet taste of memory
on our tongues. 
Listen, it’s time.
You were chosen too,
to put the world together.


^^EOP^^

You are sitting in Mrs. Caldera’s kitchen,
you are sipping a glass of lemonade
and trying not to be too curious about
the box of plastic hummingbirds behind you,
the tray of tineless forks at your elbow. 
You have heard about the backroom
where no one else has ever gone
and whatever enters, remains,
refrigerator doors, fused coils,
mower blades, milk bottles, pistons, gears. 
“You never know,” she says, rummaging
through a cedar chest of recipes,
“when something will come of use.” 
There is a vase of pencil tips on the table,
a bowl full of miniature wheels and axles. 
Upstairs, where her children slept,
the doors will not close,
the stacks of magazines are burgeoning,
there are snow shoes and lampshades,
bedsprings and picture tubes,
and boxes and boxes of irreducibles! 
You imagine the headline in the Literalist Express:
House Founders Under Weight Of Past. 
But Mrs Caldera is baking cookies,
she is humming a song from childhood,
her arms are heavy and strong,
they have held babies, a husband,
tractor parts and gas tanks,
what have they not found a place for? 
It is getting dark, you have sat for a long time.
If you move, you feel something will be disturbed,
there is room enough only for your body.
“Stay awhile,” Mrs. Caldera says,
and never have you felt so valuable.

I 
Tonite I walked out of my red apartment door on East tenth street’s dusk—
Walked out of my home ten years, walked out in my honking neighborhood
Tonite at seven walked out past garbage cans chained to concrete anchors   
Walked under black painted fire escapes, giant castiron plate covering a hole in ground
—Crossed the street, traffic lite red, thirteen bus roaring by liquor store,   
past corner pharmacy iron grated, past Coca Cola & Mylai posters fading scraped on brick
Past Chinese Laundry wood door’d, & broken cement stoop steps For Rent hall painted green & purple Puerto Rican style
Along E. 10th’s glass splattered pavement, kid blacks & Spanish oiled hair adolescents’ crowded house fronts—
Ah, tonite I walked out on my block NY City under humid summer sky Halloween,
thinking what happened Timothy Leary joining brain police for a season?   
thinking what’s all this Weathermen, secrecy & selfrighteousness beyond reason—F.B.I. plots?
Walked past a taxicab controlling the bottle strewn curb—
past young fellows with their umbrella handles & canes leaning against a ravaged Buick
—and as I looked at the crowd of kids on the stoop—a boy stepped up, put his arm around my neck
tenderly I thought for a moment, squeezed harder, his umbrella handle against my skull,
and his friends took my arm, a young brown companion tripped his foot ’gainst my ankle—
as I went down shouting Om Ah Hūm to gangs of lovers on the stoop watching
slowly appreciating, why this is a raid, these strangers mean strange business
with what—my pockets, bald head, broken-healed-bone leg, my softshoes, my heart—
Have they knives? Om Ah Hūm—Have they sharp metal wood to shove in eye ear ass? Om Ah Hūm
& slowly reclined on the pavement, struggling to keep my woolen bag of poetry address calendar & Leary-lawyer notes hung from my shoulder
dragged in my neat orlon shirt over the crossbar of a broken metal door   
dragged slowly onto the fire-soiled floor an abandoned store, laundry candy counter 1929—
now a mess of papers & pillows & plastic car seat covers cracked cockroach-corpsed ground—
my wallet back pocket passed over the iron foot step guard
and fell out, stole by God Muggers’ lost fingers, Strange—
Couldn’t tell—snakeskin wallet actually plastic, 70 dollars my bank money for a week,
old broken wallet—and dreary plastic contents—Amex card & Manf. Hanover Trust Credit too—business card from Mr. Spears British Home Minister Drug Squad—my draft card—membership ACLU & Naropa Institute Instructor’s identification
Om Ah Hūm   I continued chanting Om Ah Hūm
Putting my palm on the neck of an 18 year old boy fingering my back pocket crying “Where’s the money”
“Om Ah Hūm    there isn’t any”
My card Chief Boo-Hoo Neo American Church New Jersey & Lower East Side
Om Ah Hūm    —what not forgotten crowded wallet—Mobil Credit, Shell? old lovers addresses on cardboard pieces, booksellers calling cards—
—“Shut up or we’ll murder you”—“Om Ah Hūm    take it easy”
Lying on the floor shall I shout more loud?—the metal door closed on blackness
one boy felt my broken healed ankle, looking for hundred dollar bills behind my stocking weren’t even there—a third boy untied my Seiko Hong Kong watch rough from right wrist leaving a clasp-prick skin tiny bruise
“Shut up and we’ll get out of here”—and so they left,
as I rose from the cardboard mattress thinking Om Ah Hūm    didn’t stop em enough,
the tone of voice too loud—my shoulder bag with 10,000 dollars full of poetry left on the broken floor—

1. 
Language must suffice. 
Years ago,
               under a sweet June sky
stung with stars and swept back by black leaves
barely rustling, 
a beautiful woman nearly killed me. 
Listen,
she said,
and turned
her lovely face to the stars, the wild sky....   2. 
No. 
No: years ago, 
                     under a sweet, June sky
strung with stars and swept back by black leaves
barely rustling, 
under this sky
broad, bright, all rung around 
with rustling elders—or intoxicating willows,
or oaks, I forget—
                           under this sky, 
a beautiful woman killed me, nearly. 
I say beautiful. You had to see her.  Listen,
she said, 
and turned a lovely shell of her ear
to the swirl of stars
and the moon
                  smudged as a wingtip in one tree, not far.   3. 
Yes: she scraped my back bloody against a rough trunk.
Yes: she flung back her lovely face
and her hair, holding me down, 
and the tree shook slowly, as in a mild, persistent laugh
or wind, 
            and the moon high in that black tree
swung to and fro ... 
there were millions of stars
up where she stared past us,
and one moon, I think.   4. 
Excuse me. 
My friend, who loves poetry truly, says too much
nature taints my work. 
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Too many birds, stars—
                                 too much rain,
                                 too much grass—
so many wild, bowing limbs
howling or groaning into the natural night ... 
and he might be right. Even here. 
That is, if tree were a tree.
That is, if star or moon or even beautiful woman craning the shell of her ear
were what they were. 
They are, I think, not. 
No: and a poem about nature contains anything but.   5. 
When they descended to us, they were a cloud of stars
sweeping lightly. They sang to us urgently
about our lives, 
they touched us
with a hundred thousand hair-soft, small legs— 
and held down by such hungers, we let them cover us,
this beautiful woman, this me, 
who couldn’t move,
who were stung—do you hear?—
who were stung again, were covered that quickly, crying
to each other
                     to fly away!   6.
          ... I just can’t erase
the exquisite, weeping language
of the wasps, nor her face in starlight
and so tranquil under that false, papery, bobbing
          moon
just minutes before,
saying listen,  listen, 
nor then the weight
of her whole natural body
                                       pinning down mine
until we both cried out for fear, and pain,
and still couldn’t move.   7. 
Language must suffice.
First, it doesn’t. Then, of course, 
it does. Listen, listen. 
What do you hear? This nearly killed me.
I’ll never know
why she didn’t just whisper Here they come, warn Move!
cry They’ll kill us! 
Yes: I will save you ... 
Yes: I love you too much to watch you suffer!
But it’s all I recall, or now need. 
And, anyway, I loved her, she was so beautiful.
And that is what I have had to say
before it’s too late,
                               before they have killed me,
before they have killed you, too, 
or before we have all become something else entirely, 
which is to say
before we are
only language.

What—write my name!             How vain the feeble trust,             To be remembered       When the hand is dust— Grieve rather that the talents freely given Were used for earth—not treasured up for Heaven!

If he laughs, it’s spontaneous combustion   
If he mutters, it’s a retreating glacier
If he pouts, he sharpens his horn on stones
If he jumps up and down, its hard to look away
If he scratches himself, it’s with an aspen branch
If he gets angry, he fights with tooth, horn, and heel   
If he spits, he fights his own kind   
If he blows his nose, it starts a riot   
If he sweats, it’s monsoons
If he coughs, it unlocks doors in the next room
If he argues, it’s over lost rituals
If he sighs, it ruffles goldfinch feathers   
If he whistles, it’s overheard miles away   
If he snores, it’s over nostalgic reveries
If he scowls, spears launch from his eyes   
If he snorts, it’s over gilt lion-head spouts   
If he shits, it’s historical documents   
If he belches, it’s a diary
If he vomits, there’s finger-pointing all around
If he walks, it’s Chaplin
If he writes, it’s manifestos
If he goes shopping, it’s for lentils and peas   
If he dances, it’s the Rites of Spring   
If he swears, he’s a ryght cruell beast
If he drives, it’s among the Mountains of the Moon   
If he bathes, it’s in deceptive surfaces   
If he dresses, it’s a white linen suit   
If he wonders, it’s if his own reflection   
If he’s jealous, it’s of birthday parties   
If he lies, it’s about mathematical errors   
If he spends money, it’s on magic lanterns   
If he goes to the movies, it’s Vertigo
If he listens to music, it’s the sound of running water
If he falls, it’s down a slope of turf into the bushes   
If he recites, it’s from the Beast Epic of Alexandria   
If he is seduced, it’s a river of electricity
If he is curious, he attempts to draw
If he calls, it’s about weather patterns
If he sings, it’s ‘Tyger, Tyger’
and if he escapes, he’s swift of foot.

My brother’s worth about two cents,
As far as I can see.
I simply cannot understand
Why they would want a “he.” 
He spends a good part of his day
Asleep inside the crib,
And when he eats, he has to wear
A stupid baby bib. 
He cannot walk and cannot talk
And cannot throw a ball.
In fact, he can’t do anything—
He’s just no fun at all. 
It would have been more sensible,
As far as I can see,
Instead of getting one like him
To get one just like me.

My baby brother has a bear
that travels with him everywhere.
He never lets the bear from sight.
He hugs it in his crib at night.
And when my brother’s diaper smells,
the name of the bear is what he yells—
which is a clever thing to do
because my brother named it Pooh.

                    Of course you have faced the dilemma: it is announced, they all smirk and rise. If they are ultra, they remove their hats and look ecstatic; then they look at you. What shall you do? Noblesse oblige; you cannot be boorish, or ungracious; and too, after all it is your country and you do love its ideals if not all of its realities. Now, then, I have thought of a way out: Arise, gracefully remove your hat, and tilt your head. Then sing as follows, powerfully and with deep unction. They’ll hardly note the little changes and their feelings and your conscience will thus be saved:

My country tis of thee,
Late land of slavery,
         Of thee I sing.
Land where my father’s pride
Slept where my mother died,
From every mountain side
         Let freedom ring!

My native country thee
Land of the slave set free,
         Thy fame I love.
I love thy rocks and rills
And o’er thy hate which chills,
My heart with purpose thrills,
         To rise above.

Let laments swell the breeze
And wring from all the trees
          Sweet freedom’s song.
Let laggard tongues awake,
Let all who hear partake,
Let Southern silence quake,
         The sound prolong.

Our fathers’ God to thee
Author of Liberty,
         To thee we sing
Soon may our land be bright,
With Freedom’s happy light
Protect us by Thy might,
         Great God our King.

When I sat for a moment in the bleachers
of the lower-school gym
to watch, one by one, the girls of my daughter’s kindergarten
climb the fat rope hung over the Styrofoam pit,
I remembered my sweet exasperated mother
and those shifting faces of injury
that followed me like an odor to ball games and practices,
playgrounds of monkey bars
and trampolines, those wilted children sprouting daily
in that garden of trauma behind her eyes. 
Then Rachel’s turn,
the smallest child in class, and up she went, legs twined
on the rope, ponytail swinging, fifteen, twenty,
twenty-five feet, the pink tendrils of her leotard
climbing without effort
until she’d cleared the lower rafters.
She looked down, then up, hanging in that balance
of pride and fear,
                           then glancing
toward the bleachers to see if I watched, let go
her left hand, unworried by that boy
with the waffled skull, stiff and turning blue
under the belly of a horse,
or the Christmas Eve skater on Cagle’s Lake,
her face a black plum
against the bottom of the ice.

My dearest dust, could not thy hasty dayAfford thy drowzy patience leave to stayOne hower longer: so that we might eitherSate up, or gone to bedd together?But since thy finisht labor hath possestThy weary limbs with early rest,Enjoy it sweetly: and thy widdowe brideShall soone repose her by thy slumbring side.Whose business, now, is only to prepareMy nightly dress, and call to prayre:Mine eyes wax heavy and ye day growes old.The dew falls thick, my beloved growes cold.Draw, draw ye closed curtaynes: and make room:My dear, my dearest dust; I come, I come.

“My doggy ate my homework.
He chewed it up,” I said.
But when I offered my excuse
My teacher shook her head. 
I saw this wasn’t going well.
I didn’t want to fail.
Before she had a chance to talk,
I added to the tale: 
“Before he ate, he took my work
And tossed it in a pot.
He simmered it with succotash
Till it was piping hot. 
“He scrambled up my science notes
With eggs and bacon strips,
Along with sautéed spelling words
And baked potato chips. 
“He then took my arithmetic   
And had it gently fried.
He broiled both my book reports   
With pickles on the side. 
“He wore a doggy apron
As he cooked a notebook stew.
He barked when I objected.
There was nothing I could do.” 
“Did he wear a doggy chef hat?”
She asked me with a scowl.
“He did,” I said. “And taking it
Would only make him growl.” 
My teacher frowned, but then I said   
As quickly as I could,
“He covered it with ketchup,   
And he said it tasted good.” 
“A talking dog who likes to cook?”   
My teacher had a fit.
She sent me to the office,   
And that is where I sit. 
I guess I made a big mistake   
In telling her all that.
’Cause I don’t have a doggy.   
It was eaten by my cat.

He says he doesn’t feel like working today.
It’s just as well. Here in the shade
Behind the house, protected from street noises,   
One can go over all kinds of old feeling,
Throw some away, keep others.
                                             The wordplay
Between us gets very intense when there are   
Fewer feelings around to confuse things.
Another go-round? No, but the last things
You always find to say are charming, and rescue me   
Before the night does. We are afloat
On our dreams as on a barge made of ice,
Shot through with questions and fissures of starlight   
That keep us awake, thinking about the dreams
As they are happening. Some occurrence. You said it. 
I said it but I can hide it. But I choose not to.   
Thank you. You are a very pleasant person.   
Thank you. You are too.

                  1  hat    
As soon as I put it on
Brooklyn went dark,
but when I took it off
my wooden horse stared at me
with dazzling glass eyes.  
                  2  coat    
The shirred hem
swished on the floor.
Huge shoulders sloped
like pines under snow.
A panel in the lapel
read Kuut, Tallinn
in thread letters.
I hid at the center
behind jet buttons
too round to undo.
That coarse-nap wool
outlasted Estonian winter
but now the moths
left a trellis of holes
so it was never dark
when I curled up
hugging my knees.
My mother cried out: Who are you?   I answered
in my deepest voice: His coat.   
                  3  shoes    
I shoved my hands in
and taught them to walk:
now stumble, now march
against your will, left, right,
to the Narva front: 
now dance:
         and somewhere
in that immense city
where snow trembled
in high lit windows,
a footstep receded,
rapid, urgent,
indelible as a name.

1922: the stone porch of my Grandfather’s summer house



I
“I won’t go with you. I want to stay with Grandpa!”   
That’s how I threw cold water
on my Mother and Father’s
watery martini pipe dreams at Sunday dinner.
... Fontainebleau, Mattapoisett, Puget Sound....   
Nowhere was anywhere after a summer
at my Grandfather’s farm.
Diamond-pointed, athirst and Norman,
its alley of poplars
paraded from Grandmother’s rose garden
to a scary stand of virgin pine,
scrub, and paths forever pioneering. 
One afternoon in 1922,
I sat on the stone porch, looking through
screens as black-grained as drifting coal. Tockytock, tockytock 
clumped our Alpine, Edwardian cuckoo clock,   
slung with strangled, wooden game.
Our farmer was cementing a root-house under the hill.   
One of my hands was cool on a pile
of black earth, the other warm
on a pile of lime. All about me 
were the works of my Grandfather’s hands:
snapshots of his Liberty Bell silver mine;   
his high school at Stuttgart am Neckar; 
stogie-brown beams; fools’-gold nuggets;
octagonal red tiles,
sweaty with a secret dank, crummy with ant-stale;
a Rocky Mountain chaise longue,   
its legs, shellacked saplings.   
A pastel-pale Huckleberry Finn   
fished with a broom straw in a basin   
hollowed out of a millstone.   
Like my Grandfather, the décor   
was manly, comfortable,
overbearing, disproportioned. 
What were those sunflowers? Pumpkins floating shoulder-high?   
It was sunset, Sadie and Nellie
bearing pitchers of ice-tea,
oranges, lemons, mint, and peppermints,   
and the jug of shandygaff,
which Grandpa made by blending half and half
yeasty, wheezing homemade sarsaparilla with beer.
The farm, entitled Char-de-sa 
in the Social Register,
was named for my Grandfather’s children:
Charlotte, Devereux, and Sarah.
No one had died there in my lifetime ...
Only Cinder, our Scottie puppy   
paralyzed from gobbling toads.
I sat mixing black earth and lime.  II
I was five and a half.
My formal pearl gray shorts
had been worn for three minutes.
My perfection was the Olympian
poise of my models in the imperishable autumn   
display windows
of Rogers Peet’s boys’ store below the State House   
in Boston. Distorting drops of water
pinpricked my face in the basin’s mirror.
I was a stuffed toucan
with a bibulous, multicolored beak.  III
Up in the air
by the lakeview window in the billiards-room,   
lurid in the doldrums of the sunset hour,   
my Great Aunt Sarah
was learning Samson and Delilah. 
She thundered on the keyboard of her dummy piano,
with gauze curtains like a boudoir table,   
accordionlike yet soundless.
It had been bought to spare the nerves   
of my Grandmother,
tone-deaf, quick as a cricket,
now needing a fourth for “Auction,”   
and casting a thirsty eye
on Aunt Sarah, risen like the phoenix
from her bed of troublesome snacks and Tauchnitz classics. 
Forty years earlier,
twenty, auburn headed,   
grasshopper notes of genius!   
Family gossip says Aunt Sarah   
tilted her archaic Athenian nose   
and jilted an Astor.
Each morning she practiced
on the grand piano at Symphony Hall,
deathlike in the off-season summer—
its naked Greek statues draped with purple   
like the saints in Holy Week....
On the recital day, she failed to appear.  IV
I picked with a clean finger nail at the blue anchor
on my sailor blouse washed white as a spinnaker.
What in the world was I wishing?
... A sail-colored horse browsing in the bullrushes ...   
A fluff of the west wind puffing   
my blouse, kiting me over our seven chimneys,
troubling the waters....
As small as sapphires were the ponds: Quittacus, Snippituit,
and Assawompset, halved by “the Island,”
where my Uncle’s duck blind   
floated in a barrage of smoke-clouds.
Double-barreled shotguns
stuck out like bundles of baby crow-bars.
A single sculler in a camouflaged kayak
was quacking to the decoys.... 
At the cabin between the waters,
the nearest windows were already boarded.   
Uncle Devereux was closing camp for the winter.   
As if posed for “the engagement photograph,”   
he was wearing his severe
war-uniform of a volunteer Canadian officer.
Daylight from the doorway riddled his student posters,   
tacked helter-skelter on walls as raw as a boardwalk.   
Mr. Punch, a water melon in hockey tights,   
was tossing off a decanter of Scotch.    La Belle France in a red, white and blue toga   
was accepting the arm of her “protector,”
the ingenu and porcine Edward VII.
The pre-war music hall belles
had goose necks, glorious signatures, beauty-moles,   
and coils of hair like rooster tails.
The finest poster was two or three young men in khaki kilts   
being bushwhacked on the veldt—
They were almost life-size.... 
My Uncle was dying at twenty-nine.
“You are behaving like children,”
said my Grandfather,
when my Uncle and Aunt left their three baby daughters,   
and sailed for Europe on a last honeymoon ...   
I cowered in terror.
I wasn’t a child at all—
unseen and all-seeing, I was Agrippina
in the Golden House of Nero....
Near me was the white measuring-door
my Grandfather had penciled with my Uncle’s heights.   
In 1911, he had stopped growing at just six feet.   
While I sat on the tiles,
and dug at the anchor on my sailor blouse,
Uncle Devereux stood behind me.
He was as brushed as Bayard, our riding horse.   
His face was putty.
His blue coat and white trousers
grew sharper and straighter.
His coat was a blue jay’s tail,
his trousers were solid cream from the top of the bottle.   
He was animated, hierarchical,
like a ginger snap man in a clothes-press.
He was dying of the incurable Hodgkin’s disease....   
My hands were warm, then cool, on the piles
of earth and lime, 
a black pile and a white pile....   
Come winter,
Uncle Devereux would blend to the one color.

A name trimmed            They    are   seated   in    the   shadows
with colored                     husking   corn, shelling   peas. Houses
ribbons                              of wood set in the   ground.   I try to
                                            find the spot at which the pattern on               
                                            the   floor   repeats.   Pink,   and rosy,
                                            quartz. They   wade   in brackish water.
                                            The    leaves    outside    the window   
tricked the eye, demanding that one see them, focus on them,   
making it impossible to   look   past   them, and though holes   
were opened through the foliage, they were as useless as port-  
holes underwater looking into a dark sea, which only reflects   
the room one seeks to look out from. Sometimes into   
benevolent and other times into ghastly shapes. It speaks of a   
few of the rather terrible blind. I grew stubborn until blue as   
the eyes overlooking the bay from the bridge scattered over   
its bowls through a fading light and backed by the protest of   
the bright breathless West. Each bit of jello had been molded   
in tiny doll dishes, each trembling orange bit a different   
shape, but all otherwise the same. I am urged out rummaging   
into the sunshine, and the depths increase of blue above. A   
paper hat afloat on a cone of water. The orange and gray   
bugs were linked from their mating but faced in opposite   
directions, and their scrambling amounted to nothing. This   
simply means that the imagination is more restless than the   
body. But, already, words. Can there be laughter without   
comparisons. The tongue lisps in its hilarious panic. If, for ex-   
ample, you say, “I always prefer being by myself,”   and, then,   
one afternoon, you want to telephone a friend, maybe you   
feel you have betrayed your ideals. We have poured into the   
sink the stale water in which the iris died. Life is hopelessly   
frayed, all loose ends. A pansy suddenly, a web, a trail   
remarkably’s a snail’s. It was an enormous egg, sitting in the   
vineyard—an enormous rock-shaped egg. On that still day   
my grandmother raked up the leaves beside a particular   
pelargonium. With a name like that there is a lot you can do.   
Children are not always inclined to choose such paths. You   
can tell by the eucalyptus tree, its shaggy branches scatter   
buttons. In the afternoons, when the shades were pulled for   
my nap, the light coming through was of a dark yellow, near-   
ly orange, melancholy, as heavy as honey, and it made me   
thirsty. That doesn’t say it all, nor even a greater part. Yet it   
seems even more incomplete when we were there in person.   
Half the day in half the room. The wool makes one itch and   
the scratching makes one warm. But herself that she obeyed   
she dressed. It talks. The baby is scrubbed everywhere, he is   
an apple. They are true kitchen stalwarts. The smell of   
breathing fish and breathing shells seems sad, a mystery, rap-   
turous, then dead. A self-centered being, in this different   
world. A urinating doll, half-buried in sand. She is lying on   
her stomach with one eye closed, driving a toy truck along   
the road she has cleared with her fingers. I mean untroubled   
by the distortions. That was the fashion when she was a   
young woman and famed for her beauty, surrounded by   
beaux. Once it was circular and that shape can still be seen   
from the air. Protected by the dog. Protected by foghorns,   
frog honks, cricket circles on the brown hills. It was a   
message of happiness by which we were called into the room,   
as if to receive a birthday present given early, because it was   
too large to hide, or alive, a pony perhaps, his mane trimmed   
with colored ribbons.

Reason looks for        Where I woke and was awake, in the
two, then                  room fitting the wall, withdrawn, I
arranges it                had my desk and thus my corner.
from there                While waiting, waltz. The soles of
                               our boots wear thin, but the soles of
                               our feet grow thick. The difference
                               between “he presented his argument”   
and “they had an argument.”   I still respond to the academic   
year, the sound of the school bell, the hot Wednesday morn-
ing after Labor Day. Must the physiologist stand apart from   
the philosopher. We are not forgetting the patience of the   
mad, their love of detail. The sudden brief early morning
breeze, the first indication of a day‘s palpability, stays high in   
the trees, while flashing silver and green the leaves flutter, a   
bird sweeps from one branch to another, the indistinct   
shadows lift off the crumpled weeds, smoke rises from the   
gravel quarry——all this is metonymy. The “argument”   is the   
plot, proved by the book. Going forward and coming back   
later. Even posterity, alas, will know Sears. As for we who   
“love to be astonished,” there are fences keeping cyclones.   
Might be covered, on the ground, by no distance. She spread   
her fingers as she spoke, talking of artifice, which extends   
beauty beyond nature. Perhaps it is only a coincidence. For,   
as Neitzsche put it, “If a man has character, he will have the   
same experience over and over again.” In the morning at eight   
I sense the first threat of monotony. Give a penny with a   
knife. Candor is the high pitch of scrutiny. I was tired of   
ideas, or, rather, the activity of ideas, a kind of exercise, had   
first invigorated me and then made me sleepy, so that I felt
just as one does after a long, early morning walk, returning   
unable to decide whether to drink more coffee or go back to   
sleep. The uncommon run of keeping oneself to oneself. The   
piggy-back plant is o.k. Tell anyone who telephones that I’m   
not home. I liked doing that, had made rooms for dolls on   
trucks that way, looking in on them through windows. It was   
a pretense of keeping our distance from anything that ap-
peared pretentious. A sorry mess, but well-framed. As if a   
contorted checkerboard formed the portrait of a handsome   
woman in a hat of several ochres and umbers. The dog circles   
more than a moth before resting. Let the traffic pass. They   
were on vacation and therefore bored. Someone wanted to go   
away from everywhere forever but jumped into the bay. We   
were warned such accidents happen while mothers talk on   
phones. A doodled gnarled tree. Milk belongs to the   
mythology of cats but it makes them sick. Ours was a stray   
with ringworm. One night each year on Boston’s Beacon Hill   
the curtains remained undrawn and the public was invited to   
peek in. I didn’t wear my dark glasses because I didn’t want a   
raccoon tan. Yet this needs shading in. It seemed that I didn’t,   
after all, want a birthday empty of sentimentality. It’s on the   
compulsive buyer’s rack up front. The real adversary of my   
determination was determinism, regulating and limiting the   
range and degree of difference between things of one day and   
things of the next. I got it from Darwin, Freud, and Marx.   
Not fragments but metonymy. Duration. Language makes   
tracks.


^^EOP^^

Come, O come, my life’s delight,
 Let me not in languor pine!Love loves no delay; thy sight,
 The more enjoyed, the more divine:O come, and take from meThe pain of being deprived of thee!
Thou all sweetness dost enclose,
 Like a little world of bliss.Beauty guards thy looks: the rose
 In them pure and eternal is.Come, then, and make thy flightAs swift to me, as heavenly light.



^^EOP^^

It doesn’t take the full-wind sickness,
just the mere, the constant threat of it,
just the salt trace, its faint knocking
to bring the spirits of chance and chaos
into this house - they stand in doorways:
quaint, foul allies, swivelling their ghost hips,
tugging at their gowns of transparency
and mischief. They buzz me with lust,
and I’m undone.
                        Remember these: the Cupid
who ducked up from behind a wall and aimed
an arrow, one evening on Broughton Street;
whatever grabbed my shoulder at Earlshall;
a sound of heavy boxes pushed up and down
the empty hallway; the past is the self’s ghoul.
What is it, Roddy, you know you’ve blocked out?
What left your brain so empty that it gushed full
with circus music and the safe bet of trivia?
Here I am swinging on the fence of fences, in limbo,
where the other world loves to try my pragmatism
and it’s I who have invited them, summoned
by this self-indulgent ouija.
                                        But what is it
that folds my clothes as I sleep and leaves them
on the edge of the bed? Who hides my slippers,
re-hangs the paintings? Deja vu. Did a minor
goddess filch me in Manila and follow me home,
prone, as they are, to easy-led mortal men.
And I’m easy, easy. So, come now, teach me
to believe in the soul. Hurt me with the truth. Press
me back down on this cheap, wine-coloured carpet;
let me know for once and for all how fucked I am.


^^EOP^^




—Faulkner



My mother is a fish
and the sky is low and orange,
and the long grass rises   
in the still air.
The mud is black   
and worms turn   
their cold segments   
at my feet. 
      I used to walk   
      with an old lady.
      It seemed far from water
      and the ground sank.
      Weeds were higher
      than my head.   
      Slugs slept
      in the mud. 
My mother is a fish
and the sky swallows my head.   
A fine rain comes
and softens the ferns. 
In March before the crocus   
and the lily,
eggs bunch in the shoal   
of green jelly.
Crabs glide through them.   
A kingfisher is dead
on a rock. 
My mother is an eel   
winding a light
around the rock.   
Even without a moon   
the black glows.  
* 
The sun grows like an egg
over the bridge,
the first birds are silver
and swoop down for my mother. 
      When the lady came
      we jumped—
      She took us to find worms   
      we could squeeze
      in our hands. 
      I went with my father
      to the dark water.
      I went with a bucket
      of mud.
      When we doubled the worm   
      on the hook and it coiled,   
      I could hear how a bass
      could thud. 
      I grabbed it
      with a wet hand,   
      and watched its eye   
      go black
      as I dropped it
      in a metal bucket. 
      Hack it along the gill
      and throw the head to the gulls.

^^EOP^^

1. 
The dark socket of the year
the pit, the cave where the sun lies down
and threatens never to rise,
when despair descends softly as the snow
covering all paths and choking roads: 
then hawkfaced pain seized you
threw you so you fell with a sharp
cry, a knife tearing a bolt of silk.
My father heard the crash but paid
no mind, napping after lunch 
yet fifteen hundred miles north
I heard and dropped a dish.
Your pain sunk talons in my skull
and crouched there cawing, heavy
as a great vessel filled with water, 
oil or blood, till suddenly next day
the weight lifted and I knew your mind
had guttered out like the Chanukah
candles that burn so fast, weeping
veils of wax down the chanukiya. 
Those candles were laid out,
friends invited, ingredients bought
for latkes and apple pancakes,
that holiday for liberation
and the winter solstice 
when tops turn like little planets.
Shall you have all or nothing
take half or pass by untouched?
Nothing you got, Nun said the dreydl
as the room stopped spinning. 
The angel folded you up like laundry
your body thin as an empty dress.
Your clothes were curtains
hanging on the window of what had
been your flesh and now was glass. 
Outside in Florida shopping plazas
loudspeakers blared Christmas carols
and palm trees were decked with blinking
lights. Except by the tourist
hotels, the beaches were empty. 
Pelicans with pregnant pouches
flapped overhead like pterodactyls.
In my mind I felt you die.
First the pain lifted and then
you flickered and went out.   2. 
I walk through the rooms of memory.
Sometimes everything is shrouded in dropcloths,
every chair ghostly and muted. 
Other times memory lights up from within
bustling scenes acted just the other side
of a scrim through which surely I could reach 
my fingers tearing at the flimsy curtain
of time which is and isn’t and will be
the stuff of which we’re made and unmade. 
In sleep the other night I met you, seventeen
your first nasty marriage just annulled,
thin from your abortion, clutching a book 
against your cheek and trying to look
older, trying to look middle class,
trying for a job at Wanamaker’s, 
dressing for parties in cast off
stage costumes of your sisters. Your eyes
were hazy with dreams. You did not 
notice me waving as you wandered
past and I saw your slip was showing.
You stood still while I fixed your clothes, 
as if I were your mother. Remember me
combing your springy black hair, ringlets
that seemed metallic, glittering; 
remember me dressing you, my seventy year
old mother who was my last dollbaby,
giving you too late what your youth had wanted.   3. 
What is this mask of skin we wear,
what is this dress of flesh,
this coat of few colors and little hair? 
This voluptuous seething heap of desires
and fears, squeaking mice turned up
in a steaming haystack with their babies? 
This coat has been handed down, an heirloom
this coat of black hair and ample flesh,
this coat of pale slightly ruddy skin. 
This set of hips and thighs, these buttocks
they provided cushioning for my grandmother
Hannah, for my mother Bert and for me 
and we all sat on them in turn, those major
muscles on which we walk and walk and walk
over the earth in search of peace and plenty. 
My mother is my mirror and I am hers.
What do we see? Our face grown young again,
our breasts grown firm, legs lean and elegant. 
Our arms quivering with fat, eyes
set in the bark of wrinkles, hands puffy,
our belly seamed with childbearing, 
Give me your dress that I might try it on.
Oh it will not fit you mother, you are too fat.
I will not fit you mother. 
I will not be the bride you can dress,
the obedient dutiful daughter you would chew,
a dog’s leather bone to sharpen your teeth. 
You strike me sometimes just to hear the sound.
Loneliness turns your fingers into hooks
barbed and drawing blood with their caress. 
My twin, my sister, my lost love,
I carry you in me like an embryo
as once you carried me.   4. 
What is it we turn from, what is it we fear?
Did I truly think you could put me back inside?
Did I think I would fall into you as into a molten
furnace and be recast, that I would become you? 
What did you fear in me, the child who wore
your hair, the woman who let that black hair
grow long as a banner of darkness, when you
a proper flapper wore yours cropped? 
You pushed and you pulled on my rubbery
flesh, you kneaded me like a ball of dough.
Rise, rise, and then you pounded me flat.
Secretly the bones formed in the bread. 
I became willful, private as a cat.
You never knew what alleys I had wandered.
You called me bad and I posed like a gutter
queen in a dress sewn of knives. 
All I feared was being stuck in a box
with a lid. A good woman appeared to me
indistinguishable from a dead one
except that she worked all the time. 
Your payday never came. Your dreams ran
with bright colors like Mexican cottons
that bled onto the drab sheets of the day
and would not bleach with scrubbing. 
My dear, what you said was one thing
but what you sang was another, sweetly
subversive and dark as blackberries
and I became the daughter of your dream. 
This body is your body, ashes now
and roses, but alive in my eyes, my breasts,
my throat, my thighs. You run in me
a tang of salt in the creek waters of my blood, 
you sing in my mind like wine. What you
did not dare in your life you dare in mine.

...one begins, ungratefully, to long for the contrasting tone of some honest, unironic misery, confident that when it arrives Roddy Lumsden will have the technical resources to handle it.
Neil Powell, TLS



I’m trying to string together three words
which I hate more than I hate myself: gobsmacked, hubby and...when I realise
that words no longer count for much at all. 
And that’s me back down, head on the floor.
It’s like Cathal Coughlan goes in his song:  till I’ve seen how low I can go. 
It’s like what my ancestor told me in a dream: You’ll be a sponge for the pain of others.
It’s like what I told the lassie from the local paper: I do not suffer for my art, I just suffer. 
And face it, while we’re at it, it’s like
what curly Shona said that night at Graffiti
when all the gang were gathered for the show:
how she reckoned I would be the first to die, 
or the time I slipped back from the bogs in Bo’s
to hear my best friend tell a stranger girl
who’d been sweet in my company, mind how you go
with Roddy, he’s damaged goods, you know.

^^EOP^^

The whiskey on your breath   
Could make a small boy dizzy;   
But I hung on like death:   
Such waltzing was not easy. 
We romped until the pans   
Slid from the kitchen shelf;   
My mother’s countenance   
Could not unfrown itself. 
The hand that held my wrist   
Was battered on one knuckle;   
At every step you missed
My right ear scraped a buckle. 
You beat time on my head   
With a palm caked hard by dirt,   
Then waltzed me off to bed   
Still clinging to your shirt.


^^EOP^^

My mind hovered over my baby, like
a raptor, and froze everything it saw.
I looked through my own pregnant belly's raw
perimeters and found his heart to strike
attentive until, helpless with the pound
of still more blood, he seemed to settle down.
It was my loss to feel like god alone
for a new one always listening, to reach
inside for his ears to share the flying speech
I heard so constantly. Within my grown
silence, my sounding, my loud body where
the baby turned, my mind learned not to care
whether thoughts I felt he noticed with no fear
were mine alone—or whether he could hear.


^^EOP^^

One by one they appear in
the darkness: a few friends, and   
a few with historical
names. How late they start to shine!   
but before they fade they stand   
perfectly embodied, all 
the past lapping them like a   
cloak of chaos. They were men   
who, I thought, lived only to   
renew the wasteful force they   
spent with each hot convulsion.   
They remind me, distant now. 
True, they are not at rest yet,   
but now that they are indeed   
apart, winnowed from failures,   
they withdraw to an orbit
and turn with disinterested   
hard energy, like the stars.

To Frank O’Hara



Sometimes when my eyes are red
I go up on top of the RCA Building
          and gaze at my world, Manhattan—
                     my buildings, streets I’ve done feats in,
                           lofts, beds, coldwater flats
—on Fifth Ave below which I also bear in mind,
          its ant cars, little yellow taxis, men
               walking the size of specks of wool—
   Panorama of the bridges, sunrise over Brooklyn machine,
          sun go down over New Jersey where I was born
             & Paterson where I played with ants—
   my later loves on 15th Street,
          my greater loves of Lower East Side,
             my once fabulous amours in the Bronx   
                                        faraway—
   paths crossing in these hidden streets,
      my history summed up, my absences   
             and ecstasies in Harlem—
      —sun shining down on all I own
       in one eyeblink to the horizon
               in my last eternity—
                                     matter is water. 
Sad,
      I take the elevator and go
             down, pondering,
and walk on the pavements staring into all man’s
                                           plateglass, faces,
             questioning after who loves,
      and stop, bemused
             in front of an automobile shopwindow
      standing lost in calm thought,
             traffic moving up & down 5th Avenue blocks behind me   
                      waiting for a moment when ... 
Time to go home & cook supper & listen to
                      the romantic war news on the radio   
                                     ... all movement stops
& I walk in the timeless sadness of existence,   
      tenderness flowing thru the buildings,
             my fingertips touching reality’s face,
      my own face streaked with tears in the mirror   
             of some window—at dusk—
                                     where I have no desire—
      for bonbons—or to own the dresses or Japanese   
                      lampshades of intellection— 
Confused by the spectacle around me,
          Man struggling up the street
                     with packages, newspapers,
                                           ties, beautiful suits   
                     toward his desire
          Man, woman, streaming over the pavements   
                     red lights clocking hurried watches &   
                            movements at the curb— 
And all these streets leading
          so crosswise, honking, lengthily,
                            by avenues
          stalked by high buildings or crusted into slums
                            thru such halting traffic
                                           screaming cars and engines   
so painfully to this
          countryside, this graveyard
                     this stillness
                                           on deathbed or mountain   
          once seen
                            never regained or desired
                                           in the mind to come
where all Manhattan that I’ve seen must disappear.
 
New York, October 1958

My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love,And though the sager sort our deeds reprove,Let us not weigh them. Heaven’s great lamps do diveInto their west, and straight again revive,But soon as once set is our little light,Then must we sleep one ever-during night.
If all would lead their lives in love like me,Then bloody swords and armor should not be;No drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move,Unless alarm came from the camp of love.But fools do live, and waste their little light,And seek with pain their ever-during night.
When timely death my life and fortune ends,Let not my hearse be vexed with mourning friends,But let all lovers, rich in triumph, comeAnd with sweet pastimes grace my happy tomb;And Lesbia, close up thou my little light,And crown with love my ever-during night.

My baby brother has a bear
that travels with him everywhere.
He never lets the bear from sight.
He hugs it in his crib at night.
And when my brother’s diaper smells,
the name of the bear is what he yells—
which is a clever thing to do
because my brother named it Pooh.

                    Of course you have faced the dilemma: it is announced, they all smirk and rise. If they are ultra, they remove their hats and look ecstatic; then they look at you. What shall you do? Noblesse oblige; you cannot be boorish, or ungracious; and too, after all it is your country and you do love its ideals if not all of its realities. Now, then, I have thought of a way out: Arise, gracefully remove your hat, and tilt your head. Then sing as follows, powerfully and with deep unction. They’ll hardly note the little changes and their feelings and your conscience will thus be saved:

My country tis of thee,
Late land of slavery,
         Of thee I sing.
Land where my father’s pride
Slept where my mother died,
From every mountain side
         Let freedom ring!

My native country thee
Land of the slave set free,
         Thy fame I love.
I love thy rocks and rills
And o’er thy hate which chills,
My heart with purpose thrills,
         To rise above.

Let laments swell the breeze
And wring from all the trees
          Sweet freedom’s song.
Let laggard tongues awake,
Let all who hear partake,
Let Southern silence quake,
         The sound prolong.

Our fathers’ God to thee
Author of Liberty,
         To thee we sing
Soon may our land be bright,
With Freedom’s happy light
Protect us by Thy might,
         Great God our King.

When I sat for a moment in the bleachers
of the lower-school gym
to watch, one by one, the girls of my daughter’s kindergarten
climb the fat rope hung over the Styrofoam pit,
I remembered my sweet exasperated mother
and those shifting faces of injury
that followed me like an odor to ball games and practices,
playgrounds of monkey bars
and trampolines, those wilted children sprouting daily
in that garden of trauma behind her eyes. 
Then Rachel’s turn,
the smallest child in class, and up she went, legs twined
on the rope, ponytail swinging, fifteen, twenty,
twenty-five feet, the pink tendrils of her leotard
climbing without effort
until she’d cleared the lower rafters.
She looked down, then up, hanging in that balance
of pride and fear,
                           then glancing
toward the bleachers to see if I watched, let go
her left hand, unworried by that boy
with the waffled skull, stiff and turning blue
under the belly of a horse,
or the Christmas Eve skater on Cagle’s Lake,
her face a black plum
against the bottom of the ice.

My dearest dust, could not thy hasty dayAfford thy drowzy patience leave to stayOne hower longer: so that we might eitherSate up, or gone to bedd together?But since thy finisht labor hath possestThy weary limbs with early rest,Enjoy it sweetly: and thy widdowe brideShall soone repose her by thy slumbring side.Whose business, now, is only to prepareMy nightly dress, and call to prayre:Mine eyes wax heavy and ye day growes old.The dew falls thick, my beloved growes cold.Draw, draw ye closed curtaynes: and make room:My dear, my dearest dust; I come, I come.

“My doggy ate my homework.
He chewed it up,” I said.
But when I offered my excuse
My teacher shook her head. 
I saw this wasn’t going well.
I didn’t want to fail.
Before she had a chance to talk,
I added to the tale: 
“Before he ate, he took my work
And tossed it in a pot.
He simmered it with succotash
Till it was piping hot. 
“He scrambled up my science notes
With eggs and bacon strips,
Along with sautéed spelling words
And baked potato chips. 
“He then took my arithmetic   
And had it gently fried.
He broiled both my book reports   
With pickles on the side. 
“He wore a doggy apron
As he cooked a notebook stew.
He barked when I objected.
There was nothing I could do.” 
“Did he wear a doggy chef hat?”
She asked me with a scowl.
“He did,” I said. “And taking it
Would only make him growl.” 
My teacher frowned, but then I said   
As quickly as I could,
“He covered it with ketchup,   
And he said it tasted good.” 
“A talking dog who likes to cook?”   
My teacher had a fit.
She sent me to the office,   
And that is where I sit. 
I guess I made a big mistake   
In telling her all that.
’Cause I don’t have a doggy.   
It was eaten by my cat.

He says he doesn’t feel like working today.
It’s just as well. Here in the shade
Behind the house, protected from street noises,   
One can go over all kinds of old feeling,
Throw some away, keep others.
                                             The wordplay
Between us gets very intense when there are   
Fewer feelings around to confuse things.
Another go-round? No, but the last things
You always find to say are charming, and rescue me   
Before the night does. We are afloat
On our dreams as on a barge made of ice,
Shot through with questions and fissures of starlight   
That keep us awake, thinking about the dreams
As they are happening. Some occurrence. You said it. 
I said it but I can hide it. But I choose not to.   
Thank you. You are a very pleasant person.   
Thank you. You are too.

                  1  hat    
As soon as I put it on
Brooklyn went dark,
but when I took it off
my wooden horse stared at me
with dazzling glass eyes.  
                  2  coat    
The shirred hem
swished on the floor.
Huge shoulders sloped
like pines under snow.
A panel in the lapel
read Kuut, Tallinn
in thread letters.
I hid at the center
behind jet buttons
too round to undo.
That coarse-nap wool
outlasted Estonian winter
but now the moths
left a trellis of holes
so it was never dark
when I curled up
hugging my knees.
My mother cried out: Who are you?   I answered
in my deepest voice: His coat.   
                  3  shoes    
I shoved my hands in
and taught them to walk:
now stumble, now march
against your will, left, right,
to the Narva front: 
now dance:
         and somewhere
in that immense city
where snow trembled
in high lit windows,
a footstep receded,
rapid, urgent,
indelible as a name.

1922: the stone porch of my Grandfather’s summer house



I
“I won’t go with you. I want to stay with Grandpa!”   
That’s how I threw cold water
on my Mother and Father’s
watery martini pipe dreams at Sunday dinner.
... Fontainebleau, Mattapoisett, Puget Sound....   
Nowhere was anywhere after a summer
at my Grandfather’s farm.
Diamond-pointed, athirst and Norman,
its alley of poplars
paraded from Grandmother’s rose garden
to a scary stand of virgin pine,
scrub, and paths forever pioneering. 
One afternoon in 1922,
I sat on the stone porch, looking through
screens as black-grained as drifting coal. Tockytock, tockytock 
clumped our Alpine, Edwardian cuckoo clock,   
slung with strangled, wooden game.
Our farmer was cementing a root-house under the hill.   
One of my hands was cool on a pile
of black earth, the other warm
on a pile of lime. All about me 
were the works of my Grandfather’s hands:
snapshots of his Liberty Bell silver mine;   
his high school at Stuttgart am Neckar; 
stogie-brown beams; fools’-gold nuggets;
octagonal red tiles,
sweaty with a secret dank, crummy with ant-stale;
a Rocky Mountain chaise longue,   
its legs, shellacked saplings.   
A pastel-pale Huckleberry Finn   
fished with a broom straw in a basin   
hollowed out of a millstone.   
Like my Grandfather, the décor   
was manly, comfortable,
overbearing, disproportioned. 
What were those sunflowers? Pumpkins floating shoulder-high?   
It was sunset, Sadie and Nellie
bearing pitchers of ice-tea,
oranges, lemons, mint, and peppermints,   
and the jug of shandygaff,
which Grandpa made by blending half and half
yeasty, wheezing homemade sarsaparilla with beer.
The farm, entitled Char-de-sa 
in the Social Register,
was named for my Grandfather’s children:
Charlotte, Devereux, and Sarah.
No one had died there in my lifetime ...
Only Cinder, our Scottie puppy   
paralyzed from gobbling toads.
I sat mixing black earth and lime.  II
I was five and a half.
My formal pearl gray shorts
had been worn for three minutes.
My perfection was the Olympian
poise of my models in the imperishable autumn   
display windows
of Rogers Peet’s boys’ store below the State House   
in Boston. Distorting drops of water
pinpricked my face in the basin’s mirror.
I was a stuffed toucan
with a bibulous, multicolored beak.  III
Up in the air
by the lakeview window in the billiards-room,   
lurid in the doldrums of the sunset hour,   
my Great Aunt Sarah
was learning Samson and Delilah. 
She thundered on the keyboard of her dummy piano,
with gauze curtains like a boudoir table,   
accordionlike yet soundless.
It had been bought to spare the nerves   
of my Grandmother,
tone-deaf, quick as a cricket,
now needing a fourth for “Auction,”   
and casting a thirsty eye
on Aunt Sarah, risen like the phoenix
from her bed of troublesome snacks and Tauchnitz classics. 
Forty years earlier,
twenty, auburn headed,   
grasshopper notes of genius!   
Family gossip says Aunt Sarah   
tilted her archaic Athenian nose   
and jilted an Astor.
Each morning she practiced
on the grand piano at Symphony Hall,
deathlike in the off-season summer—
its naked Greek statues draped with purple   
like the saints in Holy Week....
On the recital day, she failed to appear.  IV
I picked with a clean finger nail at the blue anchor
on my sailor blouse washed white as a spinnaker.
What in the world was I wishing?
... A sail-colored horse browsing in the bullrushes ...   
A fluff of the west wind puffing   
my blouse, kiting me over our seven chimneys,
troubling the waters....
As small as sapphires were the ponds: Quittacus, Snippituit,
and Assawompset, halved by “the Island,”
where my Uncle’s duck blind   
floated in a barrage of smoke-clouds.
Double-barreled shotguns
stuck out like bundles of baby crow-bars.
A single sculler in a camouflaged kayak
was quacking to the decoys.... 
At the cabin between the waters,
the nearest windows were already boarded.   
Uncle Devereux was closing camp for the winter.   
As if posed for “the engagement photograph,”   
he was wearing his severe
war-uniform of a volunteer Canadian officer.
Daylight from the doorway riddled his student posters,   
tacked helter-skelter on walls as raw as a boardwalk.   
Mr. Punch, a water melon in hockey tights,   
was tossing off a decanter of Scotch.    La Belle France in a red, white and blue toga   
was accepting the arm of her “protector,”
the ingenu and porcine Edward VII.
The pre-war music hall belles
had goose necks, glorious signatures, beauty-moles,   
and coils of hair like rooster tails.
The finest poster was two or three young men in khaki kilts   
being bushwhacked on the veldt—
They were almost life-size.... 
My Uncle was dying at twenty-nine.
“You are behaving like children,”
said my Grandfather,
when my Uncle and Aunt left their three baby daughters,   
and sailed for Europe on a last honeymoon ...   
I cowered in terror.
I wasn’t a child at all—
unseen and all-seeing, I was Agrippina
in the Golden House of Nero....
Near me was the white measuring-door
my Grandfather had penciled with my Uncle’s heights.   
In 1911, he had stopped growing at just six feet.   
While I sat on the tiles,
and dug at the anchor on my sailor blouse,
Uncle Devereux stood behind me.
He was as brushed as Bayard, our riding horse.   
His face was putty.
His blue coat and white trousers
grew sharper and straighter.
His coat was a blue jay’s tail,
his trousers were solid cream from the top of the bottle.   
He was animated, hierarchical,
like a ginger snap man in a clothes-press.
He was dying of the incurable Hodgkin’s disease....   
My hands were warm, then cool, on the piles
of earth and lime, 
a black pile and a white pile....   
Come winter,
Uncle Devereux would blend to the one color.

A name trimmed            They    are   seated   in    the   shadows
with colored                     husking   corn, shelling   peas. Houses
ribbons                              of wood set in the   ground.   I try to
                                            find the spot at which the pattern on               
                                            the   floor   repeats.   Pink,   and rosy,
                                            quartz. They   wade   in brackish water.
                                            The    leaves    outside    the window   
tricked the eye, demanding that one see them, focus on them,   
making it impossible to   look   past   them, and though holes   
were opened through the foliage, they were as useless as port-  
holes underwater looking into a dark sea, which only reflects   
the room one seeks to look out from. Sometimes into   
benevolent and other times into ghastly shapes. It speaks of a   
few of the rather terrible blind. I grew stubborn until blue as   
the eyes overlooking the bay from the bridge scattered over   
its bowls through a fading light and backed by the protest of   
the bright breathless West. Each bit of jello had been molded   
in tiny doll dishes, each trembling orange bit a different   
shape, but all otherwise the same. I am urged out rummaging   
into the sunshine, and the depths increase of blue above. A   
paper hat afloat on a cone of water. The orange and gray   
bugs were linked from their mating but faced in opposite   
directions, and their scrambling amounted to nothing. This   
simply means that the imagination is more restless than the   
body. But, already, words. Can there be laughter without   
comparisons. The tongue lisps in its hilarious panic. If, for ex-   
ample, you say, “I always prefer being by myself,”   and, then,   
one afternoon, you want to telephone a friend, maybe you   
feel you have betrayed your ideals. We have poured into the   
sink the stale water in which the iris died. Life is hopelessly   
frayed, all loose ends. A pansy suddenly, a web, a trail   
remarkably’s a snail’s. It was an enormous egg, sitting in the   
vineyard—an enormous rock-shaped egg. On that still day   
my grandmother raked up the leaves beside a particular   
pelargonium. With a name like that there is a lot you can do.   
Children are not always inclined to choose such paths. You   
can tell by the eucalyptus tree, its shaggy branches scatter   
buttons. In the afternoons, when the shades were pulled for   
my nap, the light coming through was of a dark yellow, near-   
ly orange, melancholy, as heavy as honey, and it made me   
thirsty. That doesn’t say it all, nor even a greater part. Yet it   
seems even more incomplete when we were there in person.   
Half the day in half the room. The wool makes one itch and   
the scratching makes one warm. But herself that she obeyed   
she dressed. It talks. The baby is scrubbed everywhere, he is   
an apple. They are true kitchen stalwarts. The smell of   
breathing fish and breathing shells seems sad, a mystery, rap-   
turous, then dead. A self-centered being, in this different   
world. A urinating doll, half-buried in sand. She is lying on   
her stomach with one eye closed, driving a toy truck along   
the road she has cleared with her fingers. I mean untroubled   
by the distortions. That was the fashion when she was a   
young woman and famed for her beauty, surrounded by   
beaux. Once it was circular and that shape can still be seen   
from the air. Protected by the dog. Protected by foghorns,   
frog honks, cricket circles on the brown hills. It was a   
message of happiness by which we were called into the room,   
as if to receive a birthday present given early, because it was   
too large to hide, or alive, a pony perhaps, his mane trimmed   
with colored ribbons.

Reason looks for        Where I woke and was awake, in the
two, then                  room fitting the wall, withdrawn, I
arranges it                had my desk and thus my corner.
from there                While waiting, waltz. The soles of
                               our boots wear thin, but the soles of
                               our feet grow thick. The difference
                               between “he presented his argument”   
and “they had an argument.”   I still respond to the academic   
year, the sound of the school bell, the hot Wednesday morn-
ing after Labor Day. Must the physiologist stand apart from   
the philosopher. We are not forgetting the patience of the   
mad, their love of detail. The sudden brief early morning
breeze, the first indication of a day‘s palpability, stays high in   
the trees, while flashing silver and green the leaves flutter, a   
bird sweeps from one branch to another, the indistinct   
shadows lift off the crumpled weeds, smoke rises from the   
gravel quarry——all this is metonymy. The “argument”   is the   
plot, proved by the book. Going forward and coming back   
later. Even posterity, alas, will know Sears. As for we who   
“love to be astonished,” there are fences keeping cyclones.   
Might be covered, on the ground, by no distance. She spread   
her fingers as she spoke, talking of artifice, which extends   
beauty beyond nature. Perhaps it is only a coincidence. For,   
as Neitzsche put it, “If a man has character, he will have the   
same experience over and over again.” In the morning at eight   
I sense the first threat of monotony. Give a penny with a   
knife. Candor is the high pitch of scrutiny. I was tired of   
ideas, or, rather, the activity of ideas, a kind of exercise, had   
first invigorated me and then made me sleepy, so that I felt
just as one does after a long, early morning walk, returning   
unable to decide whether to drink more coffee or go back to   
sleep. The uncommon run of keeping oneself to oneself. The   
piggy-back plant is o.k. Tell anyone who telephones that I’m   
not home. I liked doing that, had made rooms for dolls on   
trucks that way, looking in on them through windows. It was   
a pretense of keeping our distance from anything that ap-
peared pretentious. A sorry mess, but well-framed. As if a   
contorted checkerboard formed the portrait of a handsome   
woman in a hat of several ochres and umbers. The dog circles   
more than a moth before resting. Let the traffic pass. They   
were on vacation and therefore bored. Someone wanted to go   
away from everywhere forever but jumped into the bay. We   
were warned such accidents happen while mothers talk on   
phones. A doodled gnarled tree. Milk belongs to the   
mythology of cats but it makes them sick. Ours was a stray   
with ringworm. One night each year on Boston’s Beacon Hill   
the curtains remained undrawn and the public was invited to   
peek in. I didn’t wear my dark glasses because I didn’t want a   
raccoon tan. Yet this needs shading in. It seemed that I didn’t,   
after all, want a birthday empty of sentimentality. It’s on the   
compulsive buyer’s rack up front. The real adversary of my   
determination was determinism, regulating and limiting the   
range and degree of difference between things of one day and   
things of the next. I got it from Darwin, Freud, and Marx.   
Not fragments but metonymy. Duration. Language makes   
tracks.

Come, O come, my life’s delight,
 Let me not in languor pine!Love loves no delay; thy sight,
 The more enjoyed, the more divine:O come, and take from meThe pain of being deprived of thee!
Thou all sweetness dost enclose,
 Like a little world of bliss.Beauty guards thy looks: the rose
 In them pure and eternal is.Come, then, and make thy flightAs swift to me, as heavenly light.

It doesn’t take the full-wind sickness,
just the mere, the constant threat of it,
just the salt trace, its faint knocking
to bring the spirits of chance and chaos
into this house - they stand in doorways:
quaint, foul allies, swivelling their ghost hips,
tugging at their gowns of transparency
and mischief. They buzz me with lust,
and I’m undone.
                        Remember these: the Cupid
who ducked up from behind a wall and aimed
an arrow, one evening on Broughton Street;
whatever grabbed my shoulder at Earlshall;
a sound of heavy boxes pushed up and down
the empty hallway; the past is the self’s ghoul.
What is it, Roddy, you know you’ve blocked out?
What left your brain so empty that it gushed full
with circus music and the safe bet of trivia?
Here I am swinging on the fence of fences, in limbo,
where the other world loves to try my pragmatism
and it’s I who have invited them, summoned
by this self-indulgent ouija.
                                        But what is it
that folds my clothes as I sleep and leaves them
on the edge of the bed? Who hides my slippers,
re-hangs the paintings? Deja vu. Did a minor
goddess filch me in Manila and follow me home,
prone, as they are, to easy-led mortal men.
And I’m easy, easy. So, come now, teach me
to believe in the soul. Hurt me with the truth. Press
me back down on this cheap, wine-coloured carpet;
let me know for once and for all how fucked I am.

—Faulkner



My mother is a fish
and the sky is low and orange,
and the long grass rises   
in the still air.
The mud is black   
and worms turn   
their cold segments   
at my feet. 
      I used to walk   
      with an old lady.
      It seemed far from water
      and the ground sank.
      Weeds were higher
      than my head.   
      Slugs slept
      in the mud. 
My mother is a fish
and the sky swallows my head.   
A fine rain comes
and softens the ferns. 
In March before the crocus   
and the lily,
eggs bunch in the shoal   
of green jelly.
Crabs glide through them.   
A kingfisher is dead
on a rock. 
My mother is an eel   
winding a light
around the rock.   
Even without a moon   
the black glows.  
* 
The sun grows like an egg
over the bridge,
the first birds are silver
and swoop down for my mother. 
      When the lady came
      we jumped—
      She took us to find worms   
      we could squeeze
      in our hands. 
      I went with my father
      to the dark water.
      I went with a bucket
      of mud.
      When we doubled the worm   
      on the hook and it coiled,   
      I could hear how a bass
      could thud. 
      I grabbed it
      with a wet hand,   
      and watched its eye   
      go black
      as I dropped it
      in a metal bucket. 
      Hack it along the gill
      and throw the head to the gulls.

1. 
The dark socket of the year
the pit, the cave where the sun lies down
and threatens never to rise,
when despair descends softly as the snow
covering all paths and choking roads: 
then hawkfaced pain seized you
threw you so you fell with a sharp
cry, a knife tearing a bolt of silk.
My father heard the crash but paid
no mind, napping after lunch 
yet fifteen hundred miles north
I heard and dropped a dish.
Your pain sunk talons in my skull
and crouched there cawing, heavy
as a great vessel filled with water, 
oil or blood, till suddenly next day
the weight lifted and I knew your mind
had guttered out like the Chanukah
candles that burn so fast, weeping
veils of wax down the chanukiya. 
Those candles were laid out,
friends invited, ingredients bought
for latkes and apple pancakes,
that holiday for liberation
and the winter solstice 
when tops turn like little planets.
Shall you have all or nothing
take half or pass by untouched?
Nothing you got, Nun said the dreydl
as the room stopped spinning. 
The angel folded you up like laundry
your body thin as an empty dress.
Your clothes were curtains
hanging on the window of what had
been your flesh and now was glass. 
Outside in Florida shopping plazas
loudspeakers blared Christmas carols
and palm trees were decked with blinking
lights. Except by the tourist
hotels, the beaches were empty. 
Pelicans with pregnant pouches
flapped overhead like pterodactyls.
In my mind I felt you die.
First the pain lifted and then
you flickered and went out.   2. 
I walk through the rooms of memory.
Sometimes everything is shrouded in dropcloths,
every chair ghostly and muted. 
Other times memory lights up from within
bustling scenes acted just the other side
of a scrim through which surely I could reach 
my fingers tearing at the flimsy curtain
of time which is and isn’t and will be
the stuff of which we’re made and unmade. 
In sleep the other night I met you, seventeen
your first nasty marriage just annulled,
thin from your abortion, clutching a book 
against your cheek and trying to look
older, trying to look middle class,
trying for a job at Wanamaker’s, 
dressing for parties in cast off
stage costumes of your sisters. Your eyes
were hazy with dreams. You did not 
notice me waving as you wandered
past and I saw your slip was showing.
You stood still while I fixed your clothes, 
as if I were your mother. Remember me
combing your springy black hair, ringlets
that seemed metallic, glittering; 
remember me dressing you, my seventy year
old mother who was my last dollbaby,
giving you too late what your youth had wanted.   3. 
What is this mask of skin we wear,
what is this dress of flesh,
this coat of few colors and little hair? 
This voluptuous seething heap of desires
and fears, squeaking mice turned up
in a steaming haystack with their babies? 
This coat has been handed down, an heirloom
this coat of black hair and ample flesh,
this coat of pale slightly ruddy skin. 
This set of hips and thighs, these buttocks
they provided cushioning for my grandmother
Hannah, for my mother Bert and for me 
and we all sat on them in turn, those major
muscles on which we walk and walk and walk
over the earth in search of peace and plenty. 
My mother is my mirror and I am hers.
What do we see? Our face grown young again,
our breasts grown firm, legs lean and elegant. 
Our arms quivering with fat, eyes
set in the bark of wrinkles, hands puffy,
our belly seamed with childbearing, 
Give me your dress that I might try it on.
Oh it will not fit you mother, you are too fat.
I will not fit you mother. 
I will not be the bride you can dress,
the obedient dutiful daughter you would chew,
a dog’s leather bone to sharpen your teeth. 
You strike me sometimes just to hear the sound.
Loneliness turns your fingers into hooks
barbed and drawing blood with their caress. 
My twin, my sister, my lost love,
I carry you in me like an embryo
as once you carried me.   4. 
What is it we turn from, what is it we fear?
Did I truly think you could put me back inside?
Did I think I would fall into you as into a molten
furnace and be recast, that I would become you? 
What did you fear in me, the child who wore
your hair, the woman who let that black hair
grow long as a banner of darkness, when you
a proper flapper wore yours cropped? 
You pushed and you pulled on my rubbery
flesh, you kneaded me like a ball of dough.
Rise, rise, and then you pounded me flat.
Secretly the bones formed in the bread. 
I became willful, private as a cat.
You never knew what alleys I had wandered.
You called me bad and I posed like a gutter
queen in a dress sewn of knives. 
All I feared was being stuck in a box
with a lid. A good woman appeared to me
indistinguishable from a dead one
except that she worked all the time. 
Your payday never came. Your dreams ran
with bright colors like Mexican cottons
that bled onto the drab sheets of the day
and would not bleach with scrubbing. 
My dear, what you said was one thing
but what you sang was another, sweetly
subversive and dark as blackberries
and I became the daughter of your dream. 
This body is your body, ashes now
and roses, but alive in my eyes, my breasts,
my throat, my thighs. You run in me
a tang of salt in the creek waters of my blood, 
you sing in my mind like wine. What you
did not dare in your life you dare in mine.

...one begins, ungratefully, to long for the contrasting tone of some honest, unironic misery, confident that when it arrives Roddy Lumsden will have the technical resources to handle it.
Neil Powell, TLS



I’m trying to string together three words
which I hate more than I hate myself: gobsmacked, hubby and...when I realise
that words no longer count for much at all. 
And that’s me back down, head on the floor.
It’s like Cathal Coughlan goes in his song:  till I’ve seen how low I can go. 
It’s like what my ancestor told me in a dream: You’ll be a sponge for the pain of others.
It’s like what I told the lassie from the local paper: I do not suffer for my art, I just suffer. 
And face it, while we’re at it, it’s like
what curly Shona said that night at Graffiti
when all the gang were gathered for the show:
how she reckoned I would be the first to die, 
or the time I slipped back from the bogs in Bo’s
to hear my best friend tell a stranger girl
who’d been sweet in my company, mind how you go
with Roddy, he’s damaged goods, you know.

^^EOP^^

The whiskey on your breath   
Could make a small boy dizzy;   
But I hung on like death:   
Such waltzing was not easy. 
We romped until the pans   
Slid from the kitchen shelf;   
My mother’s countenance   
Could not unfrown itself. 
The hand that held my wrist   
Was battered on one knuckle;   
At every step you missed
My right ear scraped a buckle. 
You beat time on my head   
With a palm caked hard by dirt,   
Then waltzed me off to bed   
Still clinging to your shirt.


^^EOP^^

My mind hovered over my baby, like
a raptor, and froze everything it saw.
I looked through my own pregnant belly's raw
perimeters and found his heart to strike
attentive until, helpless with the pound
of still more blood, he seemed to settle down.
It was my loss to feel like god alone
for a new one always listening, to reach
inside for his ears to share the flying speech
I heard so constantly. Within my grown
silence, my sounding, my loud body where
the baby turned, my mind learned not to care
whether thoughts I felt he noticed with no fear
were mine alone—or whether he could hear.


^^EOP^^

One by one they appear in
the darkness: a few friends, and   
a few with historical
names. How late they start to shine!   
but before they fade they stand   
perfectly embodied, all 
the past lapping them like a   
cloak of chaos. They were men   
who, I thought, lived only to   
renew the wasteful force they   
spent with each hot convulsion.   
They remind me, distant now. 
True, they are not at rest yet,   
but now that they are indeed   
apart, winnowed from failures,   
they withdraw to an orbit
and turn with disinterested   
hard energy, like the stars.

To Frank O’Hara



Sometimes when my eyes are red
I go up on top of the RCA Building
          and gaze at my world, Manhattan—
                     my buildings, streets I’ve done feats in,
                           lofts, beds, coldwater flats
—on Fifth Ave below which I also bear in mind,
          its ant cars, little yellow taxis, men
               walking the size of specks of wool—
   Panorama of the bridges, sunrise over Brooklyn machine,
          sun go down over New Jersey where I was born
             & Paterson where I played with ants—
   my later loves on 15th Street,
          my greater loves of Lower East Side,
             my once fabulous amours in the Bronx   
                                        faraway—
   paths crossing in these hidden streets,
      my history summed up, my absences   
             and ecstasies in Harlem—
      —sun shining down on all I own
       in one eyeblink to the horizon
               in my last eternity—
                                     matter is water. 
Sad,
      I take the elevator and go
             down, pondering,
and walk on the pavements staring into all man’s
                                           plateglass, faces,
             questioning after who loves,
      and stop, bemused
             in front of an automobile shopwindow
      standing lost in calm thought,
             traffic moving up & down 5th Avenue blocks behind me   
                      waiting for a moment when ... 
Time to go home & cook supper & listen to
                      the romantic war news on the radio   
                                     ... all movement stops
& I walk in the timeless sadness of existence,   
      tenderness flowing thru the buildings,
             my fingertips touching reality’s face,
      my own face streaked with tears in the mirror   
             of some window—at dusk—
                                     where I have no desire—
      for bonbons—or to own the dresses or Japanese   
                      lampshades of intellection— 
Confused by the spectacle around me,
          Man struggling up the street
                     with packages, newspapers,
                                           ties, beautiful suits   
                     toward his desire
          Man, woman, streaming over the pavements   
                     red lights clocking hurried watches &   
                            movements at the curb— 
And all these streets leading
          so crosswise, honking, lengthily,
                            by avenues
          stalked by high buildings or crusted into slums
                            thru such halting traffic
                                           screaming cars and engines   
so painfully to this
          countryside, this graveyard
                     this stillness
                                           on deathbed or mountain   
          once seen
                            never regained or desired
                                           in the mind to come
where all Manhattan that I’ve seen must disappear.
 
New York, October 1958

My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love,And though the sager sort our deeds reprove,Let us not weigh them. Heaven’s great lamps do diveInto their west, and straight again revive,But soon as once set is our little light,Then must we sleep one ever-during night.
If all would lead their lives in love like me,Then bloody swords and armor should not be;No drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move,Unless alarm came from the camp of love.But fools do live, and waste their little light,And seek with pain their ever-during night.
When timely death my life and fortune ends,Let not my hearse be vexed with mourning friends,But let all lovers, rich in triumph, comeAnd with sweet pastimes grace my happy tomb;And Lesbia, close up thou my little light,And crown with love my ever-during night.


^^EOP^^

By such an all-embalming summer day As sweetens now among the mountain pines Down to the cornland yonder and the vines, To where the sky and sea are mixed in gray, How do all things together take their way Harmonious to the harvest, bringing wines And bread and light and whatsoe’er combines In the large wreath to make it round and gay. To me my troubled life doth now appear Like scarce distinguishable summits hung Around the blue horizon: places where Not even a traveller purposeth to steer,— Whereof a migrant bird in passing sung, And the girl closed her window not to hear.


^^EOP^^

What do we need for love—a midnight fire
Flinging itself by fistfuls up the chimney
In soft bright snatches? Do we need the snow,
Gentle as silence, covering the scars
Of weeks of hunger, years of shabby having?
Summer or winter? A heaven of stars? A room?
The smiling mouth, the sadness of desire
Are everywhere the same. If lovers go
Along an unknown road, they find no less
What is familiar. Let them stay at home,
And all will still be strange. This they know
Who with each heartbeat fight the fear of change.

Ice on the puddles,
in the cups of fallen leaves.
I’d walk with Dad and a handful
of other men, the setters working
the fields, the underbrush.
It was my job to carry the birds.
I’d have them all plucked
by the time we got back to the car.
On the walk out I’d look
for puddles I’d missed
and break them. 
Though many moonless nights
have fallen on the grave
like a negative of snow,
Dad’s wheelchair sometimes
flashes in my mind, and I hear
the bleating down the hall,
a voice berating its god,
his worthless anodynes,
and the doctors who were
at that very moment
increasing his morphine,
having failed to note
the word alcoholic on his chart,
meaning that his damaged liver
routed the opiates straight
to his brain, his beautiful fragile brain,
which I had not yet finished loving.
My father, who still had manners,
who was a hardwood, a tough tree.
That was his first death.


^^EOP^^

A man hauling coal in the street is stilled forever.
Inside a temple, instead of light 
a slow shutter lets the darkness in.
I see a rat turn a corner running from a man with a chair trying to smash it, 
see people sleeping at midnight in a Wuhan street on bamboo beds,
a dead pig floating, bloated, on water. 
I see a photograph of a son smiling who two years ago fell off a cliff
and his photograph is in each room of the apartment. 
I meet a woman who had smallpox as a child, was abandoned by her mother
but who lived, now has two daughters, a son, a son-in-law; 
they live in three rooms and watch a color television.
I see a man in blue work clothes whose father was a peasant 
who joined the Communist party early but by the time of the Cultural Revolution
had risen in rank and become a target of the Red Guards. 
I see a woman who tried to kill herself with an acupuncture needle
but instead hit a vital point and cured her chronic asthma. 
A Chinese poet argues that the fundamental difference between East and West
is that in the East an individual does not believe himself 
in control of his fate but yields to it.
As a negative reverses light and dark 
these words are prose accounts of personal tragedy becoming metaphor,
an emulsion of silver salts sensitive to light, 
laughter in the underground bomb shelter converted into a movie theater,
lovers in the Summer Palace park.

One night in April or May,
his daughter saw someone's hand
make the curtain which was drawn tightly across her window bulge
and ran to the adjoining room in her night clothes
where he and his son were sitting.
He ran around the house one way
and his son ran the other way
and they found a Negro
under a workbench
within six or eight feet of the window
holding a piece of plank before his face—
begging them not to shoot. 
                                        2 
The Negro was dead
when the doctors examined him.
They found upon his belly   
bruises:
he died, the doctor said, of peritonitis. 
The jailer testified that the Negro had been brought to the jail
charged with burglary;
but no warrant for his arrest was produced
and the jailer did not know—or tell—
who brought him.
The Negro said that a crowd of men
had taken him from a store to the woods
and whipped him
with "a buggy trace." 
He was not treated by a doctor, the jailer, or anybody:
just put into the jail and left there to die.
The doctor who saw him first—on a Monday—
did nothing for him
and said that he would not die of a his beating;
but he did die of it on Wednesday.

In the woods at the corner of our yards   
we hang the plywood squares,
the Magic Marker images of pronghorn, panther,   
grizzly, whitetail,
and step off the paces we use to measure   
our skill.
                Here in the soft light filtering   
through needles and cones, green shifting   
membrane of poplar, hickory, live oak,   
white skin of dogwood beginning
to flower, we heft the blades,
grind points on stone, gauge the fine balance   
between what is real and what is imagined,   
the knives bringing all the animals to life   
and killing them again
as our throws bury steel deep in the heart
of the quivering wood and the blades tremble   
back through their bones.
                                       In our own hearts
we love what they might be, their shapes   
frozen in brush as though, suddenly,
they had turned from wood
and caught our scent drifting in a wind-shift.   
So we hunt this suburb, whet our aim   
to move among them in the little wilderness   
beyond the bricked-in beds of azaleas,   
sunflowers tied against tall sticks,
the half-acres of razored grass,
trellised vines, boxwoods manicured by wives.

Into this net of leaves, green as old glass   
That the sun fondles, trembling like images 
In water, this live net, swung overhead
From branch to branch, what swam? The spider’s thread 
Is less passive, where it appears to float
Like a bright hair clinging to the wind’s coat. 
Hot at work, history neither schemes nor grieves   
Here where the soaking dead are last year’s leaves, 
And over them slung, meshed with sun, a net   
No creature wove, none frantically tried to fret. 
The huge weight of time without its sting   
Hangs in that greenly cradling woof. A wing 
Has caught there, held. Held. But not to stay,   
We know, who, how slowly, walk away.

We stood by a pond that winter day,And the sun was white, as though chidden of God,And a few leaves lay on the starving sod;
     – They had fallen from an ash, and were gray.
Your eyes on me were as eyes that roveOver tedious riddles of years ago;And some words played between us to and fro
     On which lost the more by our love.
The smile on your mouth was the deadest thingAlive enough to have strength to die;And a grin of bitterness swept thereby
     Like an ominous bird a-wing….
Since then, keen lessons that love deceives,And wrings with wrong, have shaped to meYour face, and the God curst sun, and a tree,
     And a pond edged with grayish leaves.

God will have all, or none; serve Him, or fall Down before Baal, Bel, or Belial: Either be hot, or cold: God doth despise, Abhorre, and spew out all Neutralities.

Never love unless you canBear with all the faults of man:Men sometimes will jealous beThough but little cause they see;And hang the head, as discontent,And speak what straight they will repent.
Men that but one saint adoreMake a show of love to more.Beauty must be scorned in none,Though but truly served in one:For what is courtship but disguise?True hearts may have dissembling eyes.
Men, when their affairs require,Must awhile themselves retire;Sometimes hunt, and sometimes hawk,And not ever sit and talk.If these and such-like you can bear, Then like, and love, and never fear!

Although the depiction of living forms
was not explicitly forbidden, the only good news
about famines was that the station was empty.
It was about 2 A.M. The truck drove away.
A tropical insect that lives in enormous cities
stroked my hair awkwardly, organizing everyone's
schedule. She drove me back to my hotel
in a misty and allusive style, while the old
schools continued the process of devolution.
Part of the roof was loose and flapped noisily
in the wind, who needed work like that?
Poor brethren, do you have any good prose yet?
The New Chinese fiction is getting better,
I suspect, people walking and thinking and fussing,
with a nest to fly out of, with a less intimate footing.
Are we responsible for their playtimes?
Keep up your music, my dears; there were a lot of people
like that, with strange eyes, green fields and orchards.
The little house they sat in produced simple people,
cars full of blood, all they needed was a hat,
extramusical sounds, purging the emotions.
Expect no mercy, I said, from the sickbay.
And try to imagine Howard Hughes piloting the plane
that flew Cary Grant and Barbara Hutton off
toward their marriage in 1950. Well, don't bother.
The New Chinese fiction shouldn't concern itself
with anything other than a stolen turnip
and a coldness in the heart, and a lit window,
a young man on a horse appearing and then disappearing.

Come to your heaven, you heavenly choirs, Earth hath the heaven of your desires. Remove your dwelling to your God; A stall is now his best abode. Sith men their homage do deny, Come, angels, all their fault supply.  His chilling cold doth heat require; Come, seraphins, in lieu of fire. This little ark no cover hath; Let cherubs’ wings his body swathe. Come, Raphael, this babe must eat; Provide our little Toby meat.  Let Gabriel be now his groom, That first took up his earthly room. Let Michael stand in his defense, Whom love hath linked to feeble sense. Let graces rock when he doth cry, And angels sing his lullaby.  The same you saw in heavenly seat Is he that now sucks Mary’s teat; Agnize your king a mortal wight, His borrowed weed lets not your sight. Come, kiss the manger where he lies, That is your bliss above the skies.  This little babe, so few days old, Is come to rifle Satan’s fold; All hell doth at his presence quake. Though he himself for cold do shake, For in this weak unarmèd wise The gates of hell he will surprise.  With tears he fights and wins the field; His naked breast stands for a shield; His battering shot are babish cries, His arrows looks of weeping eyes, His martial ensigns cold and need, And feeble flesh his warrior’s steed.  His camp is pitchèd in a stall, His bulwark but a broken wall, The crib his trench, hay stalks his stakes, Of shepherds he his muster makes; And thus, as sure his foe to wound, The angels’ trumps alarum sound.  My soul, with Christ join thou in fight; Stick to the tents that he hath pight; Within his crib is surest ward, This little babe will be thy guard. If thou wilt foil thy foes with joy, Then flit not from this heavenly boy.

At last I know—it’s on old ivory jars,
Glassed with old miniatures and garnered once with musk.   
I’ve seen those eyes like smouldering April stars
As carp might see them behind their bubbled skies
In pale green fishponds—they’re as green your eyes,   
   As lakes themselves, changed to green stone at dusk. 
At last I know—it’s paned in a crystal hoop   
On powder-boxes from some dead Italian girl,
I’ve seen such eyes grow suddenly dark, and droop   
Their small, pure lids, as if I’d pried too far   
In finding you snared there on that ivory jar
   By crusted motes of rose and smoky-pearl.

Pardon us for uttering a handful
of words in any language, so cut loose
are we from homes, and from His name that is still   
nameless, blessed be He. We raised a prayer house— 
that is, we broke new wood for one, but some
tough burned it, snarling: “Carve only stones for the dead.”
Damp ground, no fire, no psalm we all remember.   
But tall ships anchor here, and at low tide, 
people with wheat-colored hair look out to sea,   
just as we’d searched for land. “Pray if you must,”
my father said, “and when prayer fails, a story,   
if it is all you have, will do.” Months past, 
we left Recife’s forced-worship laws in the year
of their Lord sixteen hundred and fifty-four, for our new   
world, old-country Amsterdam. Leagues seaward,   
Spanish pirates slaughtered our scant crew, 
and all that was left of us (friends wheezed
their last while they ragged us on) rose up on deck   
and tossed our bags in the sea. We watched the wake   
turn silver: kiddish wine cups, hanging bowls, 
a candelabrum for the promised altar,
carved pointers. Books’ pages curled and sank,
prayer shawls ballooned and, soaking, spiraled downward.   
Just as we stared, again we heard swords clank— 
a French ship, the Ste. Catherine (her prow had shone   
gold on a gray horizon), came to our
port side and rescued us. In that commotion
on deck, we crouched below—not out of fear, 
I swear, but stunned by luminous words
that echoed oddly—beautifully—like lightning   
flickering through palls of thickset clouds.   
A jaunty captain rasped to us in hiding: 
“Where are you bound?”
                                  “Amsterdam. Old country.”
“Where?”
             “Amsterdam.”
                                 “Antilles?”
                                                   “No, Amsterdam.”
“Yes, yes. Nieuw Amsterdam. I’ll see
you get there safely.” He meant well, bless him.  Ste. Catherine sailed to land at its tip no larger   
than a meadow, fanned out at its sides:
Manhattan Island. Our new master,
Stuyvesant, lashed us with phrases, wheffs, guzzads, 
that stung but were not fathomed, mercifully,   
when we came on a Sabbath, more than twenty   
men, women, a baby born at sea.
Still cursing, he let us land, and heard our praise, 
then disappeared among lank citizens
with faded skin who stride to the bay and brood   
on water that we trust and dread, and listen   
to tales unstamped by laws and never sacred.

I dreamed I dwelled in a homeless place
Where I was lost alone
Folk looked right through me into space
And passed with eyes of stone 
O homeless hand on many a street
Accept this change from me
A friendly smile or word is sweet
As fearless charity 
Woe workingman who hears the cry
And cannot spare a dime
Nor look into a homeless eye
Afraid to give the time 
So rich or poor no gold to talk
A smile on your face
The homeless ones where you may walk
Receive amazing grace  I dreamed I dwelled in a homeless place
Where I was lost alone
Folk looked right through me into space
And passed with eyes of stone 

^^EOP^^

a child carrying flowers walks toward the new year
a conductor tattooing darkness
listens to the shortest pause 
hurry a lion into the cage of music
hurry stone to masquerade as a recluse
moving in parallel nights 
who's the visitor? when the days all
tip from nests and fly down roads
the book of failure grows boundless and deep 
each and every moment's a shortcut
I follow it through the meaning of the East
returning home, closing death's door

Rosh-Hashanah, 5643



Not while the snow-shroud round dead earth is rolled,
   And naked branches point to frozen skies.—When orchards burn their lamps of fiery gold,
   The grape glows like a jewel, and the corn A sea of beauty and abundance lies,
              Then the new year is born.
Look where the mother of the months uplifts 
   In the green clearness of the unsunned West, Her ivory horn of plenty, dropping gifts,
   Cool, harvest-feeding dews, fine-winnowed light; Tired labor with fruition, joy and rest
              Profusely to requite.
Blow, Israel, the sacred cornet! Call
   Back to thy courts whatever faint heart throbWith thine ancestral blood, thy need craves all. 
   The red, dark year is dead, the year just bornLeads on from anguish wrought by priest and mob,
              To what undreamed-of morn?
For never yet, since on the holy height,
   The Temple’s marble walls of white and green Carved like the sea-waves, fell, and the world’s light
   Went out in darkness,—never was the year Greater with portent and with promise seen,
              Than this eve now and here.
Even as the Prophet promised, so your tent
   Hath been enlarged unto earth’s farthest rim.To snow-capped Sierras from vast steppes ye went, 
   Through fire and blood and tempest-tossing wave,For freedom to proclaim and worship Him,
              Mighty to slay and save.
High above flood and fire ye held the scroll,
   Out of the depths ye published still the Word. No bodily pang had power to swerve your soul:
   Ye, in a cynic age of crumbling faiths,Lived to bear witness to the living Lord,
              Or died a thousand deaths.
In two divided streams the exiles part,
   One rolling homeward to its ancient source, One rushing sunward with fresh will, new heart.
   By each the truth is spread, the law unfurled, Each separate soul contains the nation’s force,
              And both embrace the world.
Kindle the silver candle’s seven rays,
   Offer the first fruits of the clustered bowers,The garnered spoil of bees. With prayer and praise
   Rejoice that once more tried, once more we prove How strength of supreme suffering still is ours
              For Truth and Law and Love.

I / omen 
What was going on in the New York American
Black/red/green helmeted neon night?
The elevator door was closing behind us, we were the ones 
Plunging floor after floor after floor after floor   
To the abyss—but it was someone else’s face
Staring from the screen out at us, someone else’s face 
Saying something flashing from the teleprompter:
Though what the face said was meant to reassure,
Down in the abyss the footage kept playing, 
All of it looping back like children chanting
The answers to nonsensical riddles, taunting
A classmate who doesn’t know the question: 
“Because it’s too far to walk” “Time to get a new fence”
“A big red rock eater.” And as the images rewound
And the face kept talking, the clear night sky 
Filled up with smoke and the smoke kept pouring
Itself out into the air like a voice saying something
It can’t stop saying, some murky omen 
Like schoolkids asking: “Why do birds fly south?”
“What time is it when an elephant sits on the fence?”
“What’s big, red and eats rocks?”   
    2 / in front of st. vincent’s 
A woman hugging another woman
Who was weeping blocked the sidewalk.
Nobody moved for a moment. 
They were an island caught at the tide turning:
Such misery in two human bodies. 
Then the wearing away of the crowd
Moving flowed over them and they   
Were pulled swiftly along down the sidewalk.   
    3 / joke 
Faces powdered with dust and ash, there they were
In the fast food place, raucous and wild, splitting
The seams of their work clothes, weary to hysteria 
As they hunched in their booth next to the buffet
Under heat lamps reflecting incarnadine
Off pastas and vegetable slag. Then the joke 
Ignited, they quivered on the launch pad,
Laughter closed around them, they couldn’t
Breathe, it was as if they were staring out 
From a space capsule porthole and were asking
The void an imponderable riddle
While orbiting so high up in space 
That the earth was less than the least hint
Of light piercing the smoke-filled, cloudless night.
(What was the joke about? Nobody knew.) 
And then they stopped laughing and stared into their plates,
Ash smearing down their faces as they chewed.   
    4 / spell spoken by suppliant to helios for knowledge
                         from the Greek Magical Papyri  
Under my tongue is the mud of the Nile,
I wear the baboon hide of sacred Keph.
Dressed in the god’s power, I am the god,
I am Thouth, discoverer of healing drugs,
Founder of letters. As god calls on god
I summon you to come to me, you
Under the earth; arouse yourself for me,
Great daimon, you the subterranean,
You of the primordial abyss.
Unless you tell me what I want to know,
What is in the minds of everyone, Egyptians,
Greeks, Syrians, Ethiopians, of every race
And people, unless I know what has been
And what shall be, unless I know their skills
And practices and works and lives and names
Of them and their fathers and mothers
And brothers and friends, even of those now dead,
I will pour the blood of the black-faced jackal
As an offering in a new-made jar and put it
In the fire and burn beneath it what’s left
Of the bones of all-praised Osiris,
And I will shout in the port of Busiris
The secrets of his mysteries, that his body,
Drowned, remained in the river three days
And three nights, that he, the praised one,
Was carried by the river into the sea
And surrounded by wave on wave on wave
And by mist rising off water through the air.
To keep your belly from being eaten by fish,
To keep the fish from chewing your flesh with their mouths,
To make the fish close their hungry jaws, to keep
The fatherless child from being taken
From his mother, to keep the pole of the sky
From being brought down and the twin towering
Mountains from toppling into one, to keep Anoixis
From running amok and doing just what she wants,
Not god or goddess will give oracles
Until I know through and through
Just what is in the minds of all human beings,
Egyptians, Syrians, Greeks, Ethyopians, of every race
And people, so that those who come to me,
Their eyes and mine can meet in a level gaze,
Neither one or the other higher or lower,
And whether they speak or keep silent,
I can tell them whatever has happened
And is happening and is going to happen
To them, and I can tell them their skills
And their works and their names and those of their dead,
And of every human being who comes to me
I will read them as I read a sealed letter
And tell them everything truthfully.   
    5 / from brooklyn bridge 
Sun shines on the third bridge tower:
A garbage scow ploughs the water, 
Maternal hull pushing is all out beyond
The city, pushing it all out so patiently— 
All you could hear out there this flawless afternoon
Is the sound of sand pulverizing newsprint 
To tatters, paper-pulp ripping crosswise
Or lengthwise, shearing off some photo 
Of maybe a head or maybe an arm.
Ridiculous flimsy noble newspaper, 
Leaping in wind, fluttering, collapsing,
Its columns sway and topple into babble: 
All you’d see if you were out there
Is air vanishing into clearer air.   
    6 / from the plane 
Pressed against our seats, then released to air,
From the little plane windows we peered four thousand feet
Down to the ground desert-gray and still,
Nothing seeming to be moving on that perfect afternoon,
No reminder of why it was we were all looking,
Remembering maybe the oh so flimsy
Wooden sawhorse police barricades, as the woman
In front of me twisted her head back to see
It all again, but up there there was nothing to see,
Only the reef water feel of transparency
Deepening down to a depth where everything
Goes dark and nothing moves unless it belongs
To that dark, darting in and out or undulating
Slowly or cruising unblinking, jaws open or closed.   
    7 / spell broken by suppliant to helios for protection
                   from the Greek Magical Papyri 
This is the charm that will protect you, the charm
That you must wear: Onto lime wood write
With vermilion the secret name, name of
The fifty magic letters. Then say the words:
“Guard me from every daimon of the air,
On the earth and under the earth, guard me
From every angel and phantom, every
Ghostly visitation and enchantment,
Me, your suppliant.” Enclose it in a skin
Dyed purple, hang it round your neck and wear it.   
    8 / roll of film: photographer missing 
Vines of smoke through latticework of steel
Weave the air into a garden of smoke. 
And in the garden people came and went,
People of smoke and people of flesh, the air dressed 
In ash. What the pictures couldn’t say
Was spoken by the smoke: A common language 
In a tongue of smoke that murmured in every ear
Something about what it was they’d been forced 
To endure: Words spoken in duress,
Inconsolable words, words spoken under the earth 
That rooted in smoke and breathed in the smoke
And put forth shoots that twined through the steel, 
Words plunged through the roof of the garages’
Voids, I-beams twisted; the eye that saw all this 
Tells and tells again one part of the story
Of that day of wandering through the fatal garden, 
The camera’s eye open and acutely
Recording in the foul-smelling air.   
    9 / lamentation on ur
                               from a Sumerian spell, 2000 B.C. 
Like molten bronze and iron shed blood
          pools. Our country’s dead
melt into the earth
          as grease melts in the sun, men whose
helmets now lie scattered, men annihilated 
by the double-bladed axe. Heavy, beyond
          help, they lie still as a gazelle
exhausted in a trap,
          muzzle in the dust. In home
after home, empty doorways frame the absence 
of mothers and fathers who vanished
          in the flames remorselessly
spreading claiming even
          frightened children who lay quiet
in their mother’s arms, now borne into 
oblivion, like swimmers swept out to sea
          by the surging current.
May the great barred gate
          of blackest night again swing shut
on silent hinges. Destroyed in its turn, 
may this disaster too be torn out of mind.

(With the usual.)



I  In winter I get up at night, And dress by an electric light. In summer, autumn, ay, and spring, I have to do the self-same thing.  I have to go to bed and hear Pianos pounding in my ear, And hear the janitor cavort With garbage cans within the court.  And does it not seem hard to you That I should have these things to do? Is it not hard for us Manhat- Tan children in a stuffy flat?         II  It is very nice to think The world is full of food and drink; But, oh, my father says to me They cost all of his salaree.         III  When I am grown to man’s estate I shall be very proud and great; E’en now I have no reverence, ’Cause I read comic supplements.         IV  New York is so full of a number of kids I’m sure pretty soon we shall be invalids.         V  A child should always say what’s true, And speak when he is spoken to; And then, when manhood’s age he strikes, He may be boorish as he likes.

News from a foreign country came, As if my treasures and my joys lay there;          So much it did my heart inflame, ’Twas wont to call my soul into mine ear;                 Which thither went to meet                         Th’ approaching sweet,                 And on the threshold stood          To entertain the secret good;                         It hover’d there                 As if ’twould leave mine ear,          And was so eager to embrace          Th’ expected tidings as they came,          That it could change its dwelling place                 To meet the voice of fame.           As if new tidings were the things Which did comprise my wished unknown treasure,          Or else did bear them on their wings, With so much joy they came, with so much pleasure,                 My soul stood at the gate                         To recreate                 Itself with bliss, and woo          Its speedier approach; a fuller view                         It fain would take,                 Yet journeys back would make          Unto my heart, as if ’twould fain          Go out to meet, yet stay within,          Fitting a place to entertain                 And bring the tidings in.           What sacred instinct did inspire My soul in childhood with an hope so strong?          What secret force mov’d my desire T’ expect my joys beyond the seas, so young?                 Felicity I knew                         Was out of view;                 And being left alone,          I thought all happiness was gone                         From earth; for this                 I long’d for absent bliss,          Deeming that sure beyond the seas,          Or else in something near at hand          Which I knew not, since nought did please                 I knew, my bliss did stand.           But little did the infant dream That all the treasures of the world were by,          And that himself was so the cream And crown of all which round about did lie.                 Yet thus it was! The gem,                         The diadem,                 The ring enclosing all          That stood upon this earthen ball;                         The heav’nly eye,                 Much wider than the sky,          Wherein they all included were;          The love, the soul, that was the king          Made to possess them, did appear                 A very little thing.

Moving from Cheer to Joy, from Joy to All,
I take a box
And add it to my wild rice, my Cornish game hens.
The slacked or shorted, basketed, identical
Food-gathering flocks
Are selves I overlook. Wisdom, said William James, 
Is learning what to overlook. And I am wise
If that is wisdom.
Yet somehow, as I buy All from these shelves
And the boy takes it to my station wagon,
What I’ve become
Troubles me even if I shut my eyes. 
When I was young and miserable and pretty
And poor, I’d wish
What all girls wish: to have a husband,
A house and children. Now that I’m old, my wish
Is womanish:
That the boy putting groceries in my car 
See me. It bewilders me he doesn’t see me.
For so many years
I was good enough to eat: the world looked at me
And its mouth watered. How often they have undressed me,
The eyes of strangers!
And, holding their flesh within my flesh, their vile 
Imaginings within my imagining,
I too have taken
The chance of life. Now the boy pats my dog
And we start home. Now I am good.
The last mistaken,
Ecstatic, accidental bliss, the blind 
Happiness that, bursting, leaves upon the palm
Some soap and water—
It was so long ago, back in some Gay
Twenties, Nineties, I don’t know . . . Today I miss
My lovely daughter
Away at school, my sons away at school, 
My husband away at work—I wish for them.
The dog, the maid,
And I go through the sure unvarying days
At home in them. As I look at my life,
I am afraid
Only that it will change, as I am changing: 
I am afraid, this morning, of my face.
It looks at me
From the rear-view mirror, with the eyes I hate,
The smile I hate. Its plain, lined look
Of gray discovery
Repeats to me: “You’re old.” That’s all, I’m old. 
And yet I’m afraid, as I was at the funeral
I went to yesterday.
My friend’s cold made-up face, granite among its flowers,
Her undressed, operated-on, dressed body
Were my face and body.
As I think of her and I hear her telling me 
How young I seem; I am exceptional;
I think of all I have.
But really no one is exceptional,
No one has anything, I’m anybody,
I stand beside my grave
Confused with my life, that is commonplace and solitary.

I am a miner. The light burns blue.   
Waxy stalactites
Drip and thicken, tears 
The earthen womb
Exudes from its dead boredom.   
Black bat airs 
Wrap me, raggy shawls,   
Cold homicides.
They weld to me like plums. 
Old cave of calcium   
Icicles, old echoer.
Even the newts are white, 
Those holy Joes.
And the fish, the fish—
Christ! they are panes of ice, 
A vice of knives,   
A piranha   
Religion, drinking 
Its first communion out of my live toes.   
The candle
Gulps and recovers its small altitude, 
Its yellows hearten.
O love, how did you get here?   
O embryo 
Remembering, even in sleep,   
Your crossed position.   
The blood blooms clean 
In you, ruby.   
The pain
You wake to is not yours. 
Love, love,
I have hung our cave with roses,   
With soft rugs— 
The last of Victoriana.   
Let the stars
Plummet to their dark address, 
Let the mercuric   
Atoms that cripple drip   
Into the terrible well, 
You are the one
Solid the spaces lean on, envious.   
You are the baby in the barn.

Blood-drop, lung of fire setting past
the sea bell and wave; why am I separate
from that giant burrowing into further life? 
The body breathes and rides
a heavy-netted ocean swollen
by the tide. Under the half-moon 
it’s the lighthouse light that turns
the rest of me to early nightfall,
headland, home. I send it back, 
a mirrored flickering across cold waters.
We allow ourselves the crest that breaks
above the surface then re-forms. 
We make it human and we call it love.
This wintering is my own and not the world’s,
although the world is wintering.

Late in the cold night wakened, and heard wind,   
And lay with eyes closed and silent, knowing   
These words how bodiless they are, this darkness   
Empty under my roof and the panes rattling   
Roughed by wind. And so lay and imagined   
Somewhere far off black seas heavy-shouldered   
Plunging on sand and the ebb off-streaming and   
Thunder forever. So lying bethought me, friend,   
What traffic ghouls have, or this be legend,   
In low inland hollows of the earth, under
Shade of moon, the night moaning, and bitter frost;   
And feared the riches of my bones, long given   
Into this earth, should tumble to their hands.   
No girl or ghost beside me, and I lonely,   
Remembering gardens, lilac scent, or twilight   
Descending late in summer on that town,   
I lay and found my years departed from me,   
And feared the cold bed and the wind, absurdly   
Alone with silence and the trick of tears.

Rise, cleanly trust, divided star,
And spend that delicate fraud upon the night—
A lover’s instance moving mindful air
To make its peace in dedicated light 
Whose look is charnel. Lusters, intent and blind,
Give darkness downward with a glow like sheaves—
A gleaner’s pittance withered in the bind
That keeps the summer godhead of the leaves 
And bends tremendous evening under it,
Doubles its theft within a lonely course
Till eye and eye repeat the counterfeit
And shape the replenishing mercy at its source. 
All else were ravage: a demon-gaze of terror:
The emblem blackened in the living head,
The eye, the image, and the image-bearer
Struck to an awe with smiling on the dead. 
Therefore that bounty which, however false,
Tenders survival, and is purely given,
And lends the viewless prisms at its pulse
To make an easy legendry in heaven.  Restore that grace! Indeed, the look is grace
That deals this desert providence in air
And lifts a deathshead, burning, into place
To serve a lover’s faith. Rise, carrion star.

                         John 3.2




         Through that pure virgin shrine,
That sacred veil drawn o’er Thy glorious noon,
That men might look and live, as glowworms shine,
             And face the moon,
    Wise Nicodemus saw such light
    As made him know his God by night. 
         Most blest believer he!
Who in that land of darkness and blind eyes
Thy long-expected healing wings could see,
             When Thou didst rise!
    And, what can never more be done,
    Did at midnight speak with the Sun! 
         O who will tell me where
He found Thee at that dead and silent hour?
What hallowed solitary ground did bear
             So rare a flower,
    Within whose sacred leaves did lie
    The fulness of the Deity? 
         No mercy-seat of gold,
No dead and dusty cherub, nor carved stone,
But His own living works did my Lord hold
             And lodge alone;
    Where trees and herbs did watch and peep
    And wonder, while the Jews did sleep. 
         Dear night! this world’s defeat;
The stop to busy fools; care’s check and curb;
The day of spirits; my soul’s calm retreat
             Which none disturb!
    Christ’s progress, and His prayer time;
    The hours to which high heaven doth chime; 
         God’s silent, searching flight;
When my Lord’s head is filled with dew, and all
His locks are wet with the clear drops of night;
             His still, soft call;
    His knocking time; the soul’s dumb watch,
    When spirits their fair kindred catch. 
         Were all my loud, evil days
Calm and unhaunted as is thy dark tent,
Whose peace but by some angel’s wing or voice
             Is seldom rent,
    Then I in heaven all the long year
    Would keep, and never wander here. 
         But living where the sun
Doth all things wake, and where all mix and tire
Themselves and others, I consent and run
             To every mire,
    And by this world’s ill-guiding light,
    Err more than I can do by night. 
         There is in God, some say,
A deep but dazzling darkness, as men here
Say it is late and dusky, because they
             See not all clear.
    O for that night! where I in Him
    Might live invisible and dim!

After the jostling on canal streets
and the orchids blowing in the window   
I work in cut glass and majolica
and hear the plectrum of the angels. 
My thoughts keep dwelling on the littoral   
where china clocks tick in the cold shells   
and the weeds slide in the equinox. 
The night is cold for love,   
a chamber for the chorus
and the antistrophe of the sealight.

When I brood on Germany in the night
No hope for sleep. I know I'll lie
Awake with my eyes wide open while
Tears scald my cheeks. 
The years are a blur of past and future:
A good twelve of them have passed since I last
Laid eyes on my mother—which may be why
I'm in such a frenzy to see her. 
And I am desperate with desire.
I am under the old mutter's spell.
She circles my mind like a ring of fire.
I hope to god she is alive and well. 
She loves me to pieces, the old woman,
And when in her letters her script breaks down,
I know she's shaken to her depths, I know
When the mother in her's shocked by her role. 
My mother never leaves my mental space
Free of time past, the twelve long years,
Twelve! —that vanished without a trace
Since our last satisfying hug and kiss. 
Don't worry about Germany: it's the picture
Of health. It will outlast us. All and all.
I'll know its borders again by the flare
Of its barbarous oaks and lime-trees' salute. 
I wouldn't waste a moment thinking on
Germany were it not for my mother...;
Fatherland-is-forever; but the old
Woman, being mortal, may soon grow...cold. 
Since I left the country death has taken
Many I loved. And now the unbreathing
Impinge too much upon my sympathy.
Numbering the dead does me in. 
And yet I feel compelled to count and each
Body added to the tally has a say
In how my mourning grows: hordes of corpses
Crush my chest. What—relief—when they...give way. 
Praise the lord. And the lighter light of France
That through this window breaks as my wife, well-
Tempered, radiant as dawn, dispels
My German burden with her lovely smile. 
                                                                           after Heinrich Heine

People would come to my great-grandmother’s house.
She was in a room. They would stay in the kitchen.
The words their words rolled like cars by on a train
Here from somewhere else and going somewhere else
Moving on faster almost than we could read them,
Sound them out my brother and me with our small mouths,
Chessie, a cat, see? the Erie, Santa Fe, Ferrocarril,
Ore cars from the Southern Pacific, brown
And all the numbers of all the engines.
The words they rolled easier, fat and longer
With each beer held in a fist and hit
Against brown lips and thin tongues,
And things slid out of those mouths then with the drinking,
Took shape in sounds larger than we were, those uncles’ laughs,
Loud things which could be called back no longer.
The words they rolled into plates of food
Up with the smoke curling, there around the elbows, the words
And the smoke, a tablecloth, a rope wound like a hypnotist’s wheel)
All of it catching the heads of our mother in weak headlocks
That fooled us—we had thought we were stronger
With our thousand gatling short words,
Half tears, half whispered. We were not.
The words they rolled their wheels they rolled
Until the mayonnaise turned light and then dark brown
Until we slept in the corners, my brother and my cousins,
Me with Midnight and Puerquito, our own hands
Held around ourselves, our voices intimate
Only with the animals, who understood something of us,
Who let us hold their heads to our chests,
Who looked at the things we whispered.
The words, they rolled, they, they would not stop.
I closed my eyes then, and their phrases became birds,
Long birds, fat, snake birds that would not fly.
A single laugh, some thin tongue pulled to its shrill
Kicking roots, this one laugh, an uncle’s,
It was the thinnest and strongest string
Pulling their faces up together like puppets
And they hit each other, those wooden heads
Laughing, hit each other rolling, blunt-edged
Side hitting sides like rocks and pieces of hill
Heading along toward some bottom, heading
Somewhere, the place of the broken parts.
Nothing would take me by the hand, only the handle
On the drawer in the corner, my hand holding it, my eyes
Seeing how it became a licorice stick, then thousands of them
Holding me, by the eyes, so I could see nothing,
Hear only the sounds of a second world
In league with the thunder and this night of summer.
The words, they rolled, they would not stop,
They would not take me home.

The nightingale, as soon as April bringethUnto her rested sense a perfect waking,While late bare earth, proud of new clothing, springeth,Sings out her woes, a thorn her song-book making,And mournfully bewailing,Her throat in tunes expressethWhat grief her breast oppressethFor Tereus’ force on her chaste will prevailing.O Philomela fair, O take some gladness,That here is juster cause of plaintful sadness:Thine earth now springs, mine fadeth;Thy thorn without, my thorn my heart invadeth.
Alas, she hath no other cause of anguishBut Tereus’ love, on her by strong hand wroken,Wherein she suffering, all her spirits languish;Full womanlike complains her will was broken.But I, who daily craving,Cannot have to content me,Have more cause to lament me,Since wanting is more woe than too much having.O Philomela fair, O take some gladness,That here is juster cause of plaintful sadness:Thine earth now springs, mine fadeth;Thy thorn without, my thorn my heart invadeth.

Under a heavy wire milk case,
A piece of concrete foundation
On top, in summer, in her backyard,
Mrs. Russo keeps the cat Nikita safe
From birds, from dogs, from eating
Johnson grass, which he throws up.
Nikita waits for ants to wander in
And for the sun to leave.
Instead, she comes to keep him
Company, saying You look fat
And that her son died,
Remember I told you?
Walking thin in his uniform
On a road.

childhood remembrances are always a drag   
if you’re Black
you always remember things like living in Woodlawn   
with no inside toilet
and if you become famous or something
they never talk about how happy you were to have   
your mother
all to yourself and
how good the water felt when you got your bath   
from one of those
big tubs that folk in chicago barbecue in   
and somehow when you talk about home   
it never gets across how much you
understood their feelings
as the whole family attended meetings about Hollydale
and even though you remember
your biographers never understand
your father’s pain as he sells his stock   
and another dream goes
And though you’re poor it isn’t poverty that
concerns you
and though they fought a lot
it isn’t your father’s drinking that makes any difference   
but only that everybody is together and you
and your sister have happy birthdays and very good   
Christmases
and I really hope no white person ever has cause   
to write about me
because they never understand
Black love is Black wealth and they’ll
probably talk about my hard childhood
and never understand that
all the while I was quite happy

A Montparnasse August
with view of the Cimetière. A yard of bones. 
We wake to it. Close curtains to it.
Wake to its lanes. Rows of coffin-stones in varying light. 
Walking here. Late with shade low, low, long.
We’re passing through, just passing through
neat aisles of gray mausoleums. 
(From Paris. Send this postcard. This one.
Calm water lilies. Water lilies.
Nothing colorless.) 
It’s morning. Baudelaire’s tomb.
Tree limbs casting shadow west. 
This, a lot of time under a looming sky.
Nobody has time like this.
(Time to go to Le Mandarin for coffee
every day. We’re not complaining.
They bring the milk separate.
Watch the passersby on Saint-Germain.) 
Nothing to ponder. This is the plight.
Pause by Pigeon in bed with his wife —
both fully dressed. 
Pink flowers, pink flowers,
just beneath de Beauvoir’s name.
When she lived she lived two doors down.
Went south in August. 
All of us smell of heat all the time.
We are the living. Oh dear!
There are the dead ones there.
Their thoughts more familiar, though.
Lives finished, nearly clear.
And they make it possible for us to go on living
as we do in their blue shade.

Tell me no more of minds embracing minds,
  And hearts exchang’d for hearts;That spirits spirits meet, as winds do winds,
  And mix their subt’lest parts;That two unbodied essences may kiss,And then like Angels, twist and feel one Bliss.
I was that silly thing that once was wrought
  To practise this thin love;I climb’d from sex to soul, from soul to thought;
  But thinking there to move,Headlong I rolled from thought to soul, and thenFrom soul I lighted at the sex again.
As some strict down-looked men pretend to fast,
  Who yet in closets eat;So lovers who profess they spirits taste,
  Feed yet on grosser meat;I know they boast they souls to souls convey,Howe’r they meet, the body is the way.
Come I will undeceive thee, they that tread
  Those vain aerial ways,Are like young heirs and alchemists misled
  To waste their wealth and days,For searching thus to be for ever rich,They only find a med’cine for the itch.

In such a night, when every louder windIs to its distant cavern safe confined;And only gentle Zephyr fans his wings,And lonely Philomel, still waking, sings;Or from some tree, famed for the owl’s delight,She, hollowing clear, directs the wand’rer right:In such a night, when passing clouds give place,Or thinly veil the heav’ns’ mysterious face;When in some river, overhung with green,The waving moon and the trembling leaves are seen;When freshened grass now bears itself upright,And makes cool banks to pleasing rest invite,Whence springs the woodbind, and the bramble-rose,And where the sleepy cowslip sheltered grows;Whilst now a paler hue the foxglove takes,Yet checkers still with red the dusky brakesWhen scatter’d glow-worms, but in twilight fine,Shew trivial beauties, watch their hour to shine;Whilst Salisb’ry stands the test of every light,In perfect charms, and perfect virtue bright:When odors, which declined repelling day,Through temp’rate air uninterrupted stray;When darkened groves their softest shadows wear,And falling waters we distinctly hear;When through the gloom more venerable showsSome ancient fabric, awful in repose,While sunburnt hills their swarthy looks conceal,And swelling haycocks thicken up the vale:When the loosed horse now, as his pasture leads,Comes slowly grazing through th’ adjoining meads,Whose stealing pace, and lengthened shade we fear,Till torn-up forage in his teeth we hear:When nibbling sheep at large pursue their food,And unmolested kine rechew the cud;When curlews cry beneath the village walls,And to her straggling brood the partridge calls;Their shortlived jubilee the creatures keep,Which but endures, whilst tyrant man does sleep;When a sedate content the spirit feels,And no fierce light disturbs, whilst it reveals;But silent musings urge the mind to seekSomething, too high for syllables to speak;Till the free soul to a composedness charmed,Finding the elements of rage disarmed,O’er all below a solemn quiet grown,Joys in th’ inferior world, and thinks it like her own:In such a night let me abroad remain,Till morning breaks, and all’s confused again;Our cares, our toils, our clamors are renewed,Or pleasures, seldom reached, again pursued.

I returned to a long strand,
the hammered curve of a bay,   
and found only the secular
powers of the Atlantic thundering. 
I faced the unmagical
invitations of Iceland,
the pathetic colonies
of Greenland, and suddenly 
those fabulous raiders,
those lying in Orkney and Dublin   
measured against
their long swords rusting, 
those in the solid
belly of stone ships,
those hacked and glinting
in the gravel of thawed streams 
were ocean-deafened voices
warning me, lifted again
in violence and epiphany.
The longship’s swimming tongue 
was buoyant with hindsight—
it said Thor’s hammer swung
to geography and trade,
thick-witted couplings and revenges, 
the hatreds and behind-backs
of the althing, lies and women,   
exhaustions nominated peace,   
memory incubating the spilled blood. 
It said, ‘Lie down
in the word-hoard, burrow   
the coil and gleam
of your furrowed brain. 
Compose in darkness.   
Expect aurora borealis   
in the long foray
but no cascade of light. 
Keep your eye clear
as the bleb of the icicle,
trust the feel of what nubbed treasure   
your hands have known.’

I 
In these I find my calling:
In the shower, in the mirror, in unconscious   
Hours spent staring at a screen
At artifacts complete unto themselves.   
I think of them as self-sufficient worlds   
Where I can sojourn for a while,
Then wake to find the clouds dispersing   
And the sidewalks steaming with the
Rain that must have fallen while I stayed inside.   
The sun is shining, and the quiet   
Doubts are answered with more doubts,   
For as the years begin to mirror one another   
And the diary in the brain implodes,   
What filters through the theories on the page   
Is a kind of settledness, an equilibrium
Between the life I have and what time seemed to hold—
These rooms, these poems, these ordinary streets
That spring to life each summer in an intricate construction
Blending failed hopes and present happiness—
Which from the outside seems like self-deception. 
There is no end to these reflections,
To their measured music with its dying fall   
Wherein the heart and what it seeks are reconciled.   
I live them, and as though in gratitude
They shape my days, from morning with its sweetest smile   
Until the hour when sleep blows out the candle.   
Between, the present falls away,
And for a while the old romance resumes,   
Familiar but unrecognized, an undiscovered place   
Concealed within the confines of this room,
That seems at once a form of feeling and a state of grace   
Prepared for me, written in my name
Against the time when time has finally merged
These commonplace surroundings with what lies behind the veil—
Leaving behind at least a version of the truth   
Composed of what I felt and what I saw outside my window   
On a summer morning; melding sound and sense,   
A music and a mood, together in a hesitant embrace   
That makes them equal at the end.  
       II 
There may be nothing for a poem to change   
But an atmosphere: conventional or strange,   
Its meaning is enclosed by the perception   
—Better, by the misperception—
Of what time held and what the future knew;   
Which is to say this very moment.
And yet the promise of a distant
Purpose is what makes each moment new. 
There may be nothing for the soul to say   
In its defense, except to describe the way   
It came to find itself at the impasse
Morning reveals in the glass—
The road that led away from home to here,   
That began in wonderment and hope,   
But that ended in the long slope
Down to loneliness and the fear of fear. 
The casuistry is all in the event,
Contingent on what someone might have meant   
Or might still mean. What feels most frightening   
Is the thought that when the lightning
Has subsided, and the clearing sky
Appears at last above the stage
To mark the only end of age,
That God, that distant and unseeing eye, 
Would see that none of this had ever been:   
That none of it, apparent or unseen,
Was ever real, and all the private words,   
Which seemed to fill the air like birds
Exploding from the brush, were merely sounds   
Without significance or sense,
Inert and dead beneath the dense
Expanse of the earth in its impassive rounds. 
There may be no rejoinder to that thought.
There may be nothing that one could have sought   
That might have lent the search significance,   
Or even a kind of coherence.
Perhaps. Yet closer to me than the grandeur   
Of the vast and the uncreated
Is the calm of this belated
Moment in its transitory splendor.  
       III 
Someone asked about the aura of regret
And disappointment that surrounds these poems,   
About the private facts those feelings might conceal,   
And what their source was in my life. 
I said that none of it was personal,
That as lives go my own life was a settled one,   
Comprising both successes and misfortunes, the successes   
Not especially striking, the misfortunes small. 
And yet the question is a real one,
And not for me alone, though certainly for me.   
For even if, as Wittgenstein once claimed,   
That while the facts may stay the same 
And what is true of one is true of both,
The happy and unhappy man inhabit different worlds,   
One still would want to know which world this is,   
And how that other one could seem so close. 
So much of how life feels lies in the phrasing,
In the way a thought starts, then turns back upon itself   
Until its question hangs unanswered in the breeze.   
Perhaps the sadness is a way of seeming free, 
Of denying what can change or disappear,   
Of tearing free from circumstance,
As though the soul could only speak out from the   
Safety of some private chamber in the air. 
Let me try once more. I think the saddest moments   
Are the ones that also seem most beautiful,   
For the nature of a moment is to fade,
Leaving everything unaltered, and the landscape 
Where the light fell as it was before.
And time makes poetry from what it takes away,   
And the measure of experience
Is not that it be real, but that it last, 
And what one knows is simply what one knew,   
And what I want is simply what I had.
These are the premises that structure what I feel,   
The axioms that govern my imagination, 
And beneath them lies the fear—
Not the fear of the unknown, but the fear of growing old   
Unchanged, of looking in the mirror
At a future that repeats itself ad infinitum. 
It could be otherwise so easily.
The transience that lectures so insistently of loss   
Could speak as clearly of an openness renewed,   
A life made sweeter by its changing; 
And the shadows of the past
Could seem a shade where one could linger for a while   
Before returning to the world, and moving on.   
The way would be the same in either case, 
Extending for an unknown span of years
Experienced from two perspectives, a familiar course   
Accessible to all, yet narrowing,
As the journey nears its end, to one. 
The difference isn’t in the details
Or the destination, but in how things feel along the road:   
The secret of the quest lies all around me,
While what lurks below the surface is another story, 
One of no more consequence or import than the last.   
What matters isn’t what one chances to believe,   
But the force of one’s attachments,
And instead of looking for an answer in a dream 
Set aside the question, let the songs continue   
Going through the motions of the days
And waking every morning to this single world,   
Whether in regret, or in celebration.  
       IV 
Each day begins as yesterday began:   
A cat in silhouette in the dim light   
Of what the morning holds—
Breakfast and The New York Times, a man
Taking a shower, a poem taking flight
As a state of mind unfolds   
So unpredictably.
Through the hot summer air   
I walk to a building where
I give a lecture on philosophy 
In the strict sense; then go home to the cat.   
A narrow life; or put another way,
A life whose facts can all
Be written on a page, the narrow format   
Of this tiny novel of a day, Ulysses written small,
A diary so deep
Its rhythms seem unreal:
A solitary meal.
Some records or a movie. And then sleep.  
       V 
At the ending of the remake of The Thing
Kurt Russell and one other guy
Are all that’s left of what had been the crew
Of an Antarctic outpost. Some horrifying presence   
—Some protean thing—establishes itself
Inside the person of an ordinary man
And then, without a warning, erupts in devastation.   
The two survivors eye each other slowly,
Neither knowing whether one of them
Still holds the horror. “What do we do now?”
The second asks, and Russell says,
“Let’s see what happens,” and the movie ends. 
“Horror” is too strong, but substitute the fear
I spoke about before, and the scene is apt.
I don’t know, as no one really knows,
What might lie waiting in the years to come,
But sometimes when the question touches me I feel afraid—
Not of age, but an age that seems a prolongation of this afternoon,   
That looks ahead, and looks instead into itself.
This is the fear that draws me back inside:
That this is all there is, that what I hold so easily
Will vanish soon, and nothing like it will be given me again.   
The days will linger and the nights rehearse themselves   
Until the secret of my life has finally emerged—
Not in devastation, but in a long decline
That leads at least as surely to a single end. 
And then I turn away and see the sky
That soars above the streets of North Point North,   
Reducing everyone to anonymity, an anonymity
In which I find a kind of possibility, a kind of freedom   
As the world—the only world—rolls on its way,
Oblivious to anything I might say, or that might happen in a poem.   
A poem can seize and hold a moment fast, yet it can   
Limit what there is to feel, and stake a distance from the world.   
The neighborhood around me wakes each day to lives   
No different than my own, lives harboring the same ambitions   
And regrets, but living on the humbler stuff of happiness.   
The disappointments come and go; what stays   
Is part of an abiding presence, human and serene.
The houses wait unquestioning in the light
Of an approaching summer evening, while a vast   
Contentment answers from the air.
I think I know where this is going to end,   
But still my pleasure is to wait—
Not wait, perhaps, for anything within,
But for what lies outside. Let’s see what happens.

Last night, as half asleep I dreaming lay,     Half naked came she in her little shift,          With tilted glass, and verses on her lips; Narcissus-eyes all shining for the fray,          Filled full of frolic to her wine-red lips,          Warm as a dewy rose, sudden she slips     Into my bed – just in her little shift.  Said she, half naked, half asleep, half heard, With a soft sigh betwixt each lazy word, ‘Oh my old lover, do you sleep or wake!’ And instant I sat upright for her sake, And drank whatever wine she poured for me –  Wine of the tavern, or vintage it might be Of Heaven’s own vine: he surely were a churl Who refused wine poured out by such a girl, A double traitor he to wine and love. Go to, thou puritan! the gods above Ordained this wine for us, but not for thee; Drunkards we are by a divine decree, Yea, by the special privilege of heaven Foredoomed to drink and foreordained forgiven.   Ah! HAFIZ, you are not the only man     Who promised penitence and broke down after; For who can keep so hard a promise, man,      With wine and woman brimming o’er with laughter! O knotted locks, filled like a flower with scent, How have you ravished this poor penitent!

With last night’s wine still singing in my head, I sought the tavern at the break of day, Though half the world was still asleep in bed; The harp and flute were up and in full swing, And a most pleasant morning sound made they; Already was the wine-cup on the wing. ‘Reason,’ said I, ‘’t is past the time to start, If you would reach your daily destination, The holy city of intoxication.’   So did I pack him off, and he depart With a stout flask for fellow-traveller.  Left to myself, the tavern-wench I spied, And sought to win her love by speaking fair; Alas! she turned upon me, scornful-eyed, And mocked my foolish hopes of winning her. Said she, her arching eyebrows like a bow: ‘Thou mark for all the shafts of evil tongues! Thou shalt not round my middle clasp me so, Like my good girdle – not for all thy songs! – So long as thou in all created things Seest but thyself the centre and the end. Go spread thy dainty nets for other wings – Too high the Anca’s nest for thee, my friend.’  Then took I shelter from that stormy sea In the good ark of wine; yet, woe is me! Saki and comrade and minstrel all by turns, She is of maidens the compendium Who my poor heart in such a fashion spurns. Self, HAFIZ, self! That thou must overcome! Hearken the wisdom of the tavern-daughter! Vain little baggage – well, upon my word! Thou fairy figment made of clay and water, As busy with thy beauty as a bird.  Well, HAFIZ, Life’s a riddle – give it up: There is no answer to it but this cup.

A B H O R R E N C E S
4 July, 1986



America is inconceivable without drugs
and always has been. One of the first acts
was to dump the tea. The drug that furnished
the mansions of Virginia was tobacco,
a drug now in much disrepute.
Sassafras, a cure-all, is what they came for
and they dealt it by the bale altho it
was only a diaphoretic to make you perspire—
people were so simple in those days.
The Civil War saw the isolation of morphine
making amputation a pleasure and making
the block of wood between the teeth,
which was no drug, obsolete. Morphinism
was soon widespread among doctors and patients.
At this date interns, the reports tell us,
are among the premier drug ab/users
of said moralistic nation. “Rock” stars
(who notoriously “have” doctors)
consume drugs by the metric ton
even as they urge teenagers to Say No.
The undercurrent of American history

of the worn path to the door of the apothecary
to fetch cannabis and cocaine elixirs
by the gallon. It has been all prone
all seeking Florida, Ponce de León
was just the beginning of a statistical curve
whose only satisfaction would be total vertigo.
His eager search for youth has become our
frantic tilt with death and boredom,
in fact we are farming death in Florida
with far greater profit than we are
farming food in Iowa—elixirs are as multiform
as the life-style frauds we implore,
a cultural patchwork fit for a fool
in the only country in the world
with a shop called the Drug Store.

And what if I had simply passed you by,
your false skins gathering light in a basket,   
those skins of unpolished copper,
would you have lived more greatly? 
Now you are free of that metallic coating,
a broken hull of parchment,
the dried petals of a lily—
those who have not loved you
will not know differently. 
But you are green fading into yellow—
how deceptive you have been. 
Once I played the cithara,
fingers chafing against each note.
Once I worked the loom,
cast the shuttle through the warp.
Once I scrubbed the tiles
deep in the tub of Alejandro.
Now I try to deciper you. 
Beyond the village, within a cloud
of wild cacao and tamarind,
they chant your tale, how you,
most common of your kind,
make the great warrior-men cry
but a woman can unravel you.

Guarda mi disse, le feroce Erine



Let us come upon him first as if in a dream,
anonymous triple presence,
memory made substance and tally of heart’s rot:
then in the waking Now be demonstrable, seem
sole aspect of being’s essence,
coffin to the living touch, self’s Iscariot.
Then he will loath the year’s recurrent long caress
without hope of divorce,
envying idiocy’s apathy or the stress
of definite remorse.
He will lapse into a halflife lest the taut force
of the mind’s eagerness
recall those fiends or new apparitions endorse
his excessive distress.
He will shrink, his manhood leave him, slough selfaware
the last skin of the flayed: despair.
He will nurse his terror carefully, uncertain
even of death’s solace,
impotent to outpace
dispersion of the soul, disruption of the brain.

Nothing
substance utters or time
stills and restrains
joins design and 
supple measure deftly
as thought’s intricate polyphonic
score dovetails with the tread
sensuous things
keep in our consciousness. 
Celebrate man’s craft
and the word spoken in shapeless night, the
sharp tool paring away
waste and the forms
cut out of mystery! 
When taut string’s note
passes ears’ reach or red rays or violet
fade, strong over unseen
forces the word
ranks and enumerates... 
mimes clouds condensed
and hewn hills and bristling forests,
steadfast corn in its season
and the seasons
in their due array, 
life of man’s own body
and death...
                  The sound thins into melody,
discourse narrowing, craft
failing, design
petering out. 
Ears heavy to breeze of speech and
thud of the ictus.

Four white heifers with sprawling hooves
         trundle the waggon.
   Its ill-roped crates heavy with fruit sway.
The chisel point of the goad, blue and white,
         glitters ahead,
   a flame to follow lance-high in a man’s hand
who does not shave. His linen trousers
         like him want washing.
   You can see his baked skin through his shirt.
He has no shoes and his hat has a hole in it.
         ‘Hu ! vaca ! Hu ! vaca !’
   he says staccato without raising his voice;
‘Adios caballero’ legato but
         in the same tone.
   Camelmen high on muzzled mounts
boots rattling against the panels
         of an empty
   packsaddle do not answer strangers.
Each with his train of seven or eight tied
         head to tail they
   pass silent but for the heavy bells
and plip of slobber dripping from
         muzzle to dust;
   save that on sand their soles squeak slightly.
Milkmaids, friendly girls between
         fourteen and twenty
   or younger, bolt upright on small
trotting donkeys that bray (they arch their
         tails a few inches
   from the root, stretch neck and jaw forward
to make the windpipe a trumpet)
         chatter. Jolted
   cans clatter. The girls’ smiles repeat
the black silk curve of the wimple
         under the chin.
   Their hats are absurd doll’s hats
or flat-crowned to take a load.
         All have fine eyes.
   You can guess their balanced nakedness
under the cotton gown and thin shift.
         They sing and laugh.
   They say ‘Adios!’ shyly but look back
more than once, knowing our thoughts
         and sharing our
   desires and lack of faith in desire.

See! Their verses are laid
as mosaic gold to gold
gold to lapis lazuli
white marble to porphyry
stone shouldering stone, the dice
polished alike, there is
no cement seen and no gap
between stones as the frieze strides
to the impending apse:
the rays of many glories
forced to its focus forming
a glory neither of stone
nor metal, neither of words
nor verses, but of the light
shining upon no substance;
a glory not made
for which all else was made.

“Stephen Smith, University of Iowa sophomore, burned what he said was his draft card”
and Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned what he said was himself.
You, Robert McNamara, burned what you said was a concentration
of the Enemy Aggressor.
No news medium troubled to put it in quotes. 
And Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned what he said was himself.
He said it with simple materials such as would be found in your kitchen.
In your office you were informed.
Reporters got cracking frantically on the mental disturbance angle.
So far nothing turns up. 
Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned, and while burning, screamed.
No tip-off. No release.
Nothing to quote, to manage to put in quotes.
Pity the unaccustomed hesitance of the newspaper editorialists.
Pity the press photographers, not called. 
Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned and was burned and said
all that there is to say in that language.
Twice what is said in yours.
It is a strange sect, Mr. McNamara, under advice to try
the whole of a thought in silence, and to oneself.

How Love came in, I do not know,Whether by th’ eye, or eare, or no:Or whether with the soule it came(At first) infused with the same:Whether in part ‘tis here or there,Or, like the soule, whole every where:This troubles me: but as I wellAs any other, this can tell;That when from hence she does depart,The out-let then is from the heart.

The poem of the mind in the act of finding   
What will suffice. It has not always had   
To find: the scene was set; it repeated what   
Was in the script.
                               Then the theatre was changed   
To something else. Its past was a souvenir. 
It has to be living, to learn the speech of the place.   
It has to face the men of the time and to meet   
The women of the time. It has to think about war   
And it has to find what will suffice. It has   
To construct a new stage. It has to be on that stage   
And, like an insatiable actor, slowly and
With meditation, speak words that in the ear,   
In the delicatest ear of the mind, repeat,
Exactly, that which it wants to hear, at the sound   
Of which, an invisible audience listens,
Not to the play, but to itself, expressed
In an emotion as of two people, as of two   
Emotions becoming one. The actor is
A metaphysician in the dark, twanging
An instrument, twanging a wiry string that gives   
Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses, wholly   
Containing the mind, below which it cannot descend,   
Beyond which it has no will to rise.
                                                      It must
Be the finding of a satisfaction, and may
Be of a man skating, a woman dancing, a woman   
Combing. The poem of the act of the mind.

When we for age could neither read nor write,The subject made us able to indite.The soul, with nobler resolutions deckt,The body stooping, does herself erect:No mortal parts are requisite to raiseHer, that unbodied can her Maker praise.
The seas are quiet, when the winds give o’er,So calm are we, when passions are no more:For then we know how vain it was to boastOf fleeting things, so certain to be lost.Clouds of affection from our younger eyesConceal that emptiness, which age descries.
The soul’s dark cottage, batter’d and decay’d,Lets in new light through chinks that time has made;Stronger by weakness, wiser men becomeAs they draw near to their eternal home:Leaving the old, both worlds at once they view,That stand upon the threshold of the new.

When a creature dies ... the flesh
and soft parts of the body rot quickly.
All that is left are the bones and teeth.
       (textbook entry on ‘fossils’) 
Sometimes. You, mother,
dying, left what was hard first:
bones weeping into 
your veins like flutes, teeth
vanished on some hospital
lunch tray. In your last 
mute days you parted
with one more hard thing: the gold
ring I was to save 
for my child. As your
hand offered that bright circle
(only seen as a 
whole now, when empty)
did your thoughts reach, like mine, for
your first wedding ring? 
You took that one off
when I was seven or eight
and sent it spinning 
from a car window.
I can still feel the wet blades
of grass slipping through 
my fingers, night dew
coming on, you and father
loud in the parked car. 
I searched there as if
life spilled from a ring that lay
somewhere out of sight 
but within reach, hid
where only the crickets knew.
I took the scraping 
of their mating calls
for crying, as if they shared
loss—my childish heart 
consoled by a soft
‘as if.’ The consolation
carries on: their song 
(light as air, softer
than voices) plays through my thoughts
about that evening 
and fills the lost ring’s
hollow with life’s most lasting
part, cries for new love.

Oft, in the stilly night,Ere slumber’s chain has bound me,Fond memory brings the lightOf other days around me;The smiles, the tears,Of boyhood’s years,The words of love then spoken;The eyes that shone,Now dimm’d and gone,The cheerful hearts now broken!Thus, in the stilly night,Ere slumber’s chain hath bound me,Sad memory brings the lightOf other days around me.
When I remember allThe friends, so link’d together,I’ve seen around me fall,Like leaves in wintry weather;I feel like oneWho treads aloneSome banquet-hall deserted,Whose lights are fled,Whose garlands dead,And all but he departed!Thus, in the stilly night,Ere slumber’s chain has bound me,Sad memory brings the lightOf other days around me.

Oh, for a bowl of fat Canary, Rich Palermo, sparkling Sherry, Some nectar else, from Juno’s dairy; Oh, these draughts would make us merry!  Oh, for a wench (I deal in faces, And in other daintier things); Tickled am I with her embraces, Fine dancing in such fairy rings.  Oh, for a plump fat leg of mutton, Veal, lamb, capon, pig, and coney; None is happy but a glutton, None an ass but who wants money.  Wines indeed and girls are good, But brave victuals feast the blood; For wenches, wine, and lusty cheer, Jove would leap down to surfeit here.

Oh, how the hand the lover ought to prize

  Informs him of his mistress’ heart;’Tis that which gives him all his bliss
  When dear love-secrets ’twill impart:That plights the faith the maid bestows,And that confirms the tim’rous vows.
’Tis that betrays the tenderness
  Which the too bashful tongue denies;’Tis that which does the heart confess,
  And spares the language of the eyes;’Tis that which treasure gives so vast,Ev’n Iris ’twill to Damon give at last.

Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay,Gone are my friends from the cotton fields away,Gone from the earth to a better land I know,I hear their gentle voices calling “Old Black Joe.”
I’m coming, I’m coming, for my head is bending low:I hear those gentle voices calling, “Old Black Joe.”
Why do I weep when my heart should feel no painWhy do I sigh that my friends come not again,Grieving for forms Now departed long a go?I hear their gentle voices calling “Old Black Joe.”
I’m coming, I’m coming, for my head is bending low:I hear those gentle voices calling, “Old Black Joe.”
Where are the hearts once so happy and so free?The children so dear that I held upon my knee,Gone to the shore where my soul has longed to go.I hear their gentle voices calling “Old Black Joe.”

Who can say now,
“When I was young, the country was very beautiful?
Oaks and willows grew along the rivers
and there were many herbs and flowering bushes.
The forests were so dense the deer slipped through
the cottonwoods and maples unseen.” 
Who would listen?
Who will carry even the vicarious tone of that time? 
In the old days
                        age was honored.
Today it’s whim,

Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!
   Long has it waved on high,
And many an eye has danced to see
   That banner in the sky;
Beneath it rung the battle shout,
   And burst the cannon’s roar;—
The meteor of the ocean air
   Shall sweep the clouds no more! 
Her deck, once red with heroes’ blood
   Where knelt the vanquished foe,
When winds were hurrying o’er the flood
   And waves were white below,
No more shall feel the victor’s tread,
   Or know the conquered knee;—
The harpies of the shore shall pluck
   The eagle of the sea! 
O, better that her shattered hulk
   Should sink beneath the wave;
Her thunders shook the mighty deep,
   And there should be her grave;
Nail to the mast her holy flag,
   Set every thread-bare sail,
And give her to the god of storms,—
   The lightning and the gale!

In my heart the old love  
 Struggled with the new,  It was ghostly waking  
 All night through.   
Dear things, kind things  
 That my old love said,  Ranged themselves reproachfully  
 Round my bed.   
But I could not heed them,  
 For I seemed to see  Dark eyes of my new love  
 Fixed on me.   
Old love, old love,  
 How can I be true?  Shall I be faithless to myself  
 Or to you?

the line ageless
                         as the independence of time.
Musters tears

the inner ear,
                     yet does not matter.

Here is my hand.

and look into his eyes.
                                    I do not avert mine,

I feel older, younger, both
at once. Every time I win,
I lose. Every time I count,
I forget and must begin again. 
I must begin again, and again I
must begin. Every time I lose,
I win and must begin again. 
Everything I plan must wait, and
having to wait has made me old, and
the older I get, the more I wait, and everything
I’m waiting for has already been planned. 
I feel sadder, wiser, neither
together. Everything is almost
true, and almost true is everywhere.
I feel sadder, wiser, neither at once. 
I end in beginning, in ending I find
that beginning is the first thing to do.
I stop when I start, but my heart keeps on beating,
so I must go on starting in spite of the stopping. 
I must stop my stopping and start to start—
I can end at the beginning or begin at the end.
I feel older, younger, both at once.

BOOK SIX   Chapter XLIV  I 
In hill-towns, from San Fernando to Mayagüez,   
the same sunrise stirred the feathered lances of cane   
down the archipelago’s highways. The first breeze 
rattled the spears and their noise was like distant rain   
marching down from the hills, like a shell at your ears.   
In the cool asphalt Sundays of the Antilles 
the light brought the bitter history of sugar
across the squared fields, heightening towards harvest,   
to the bleached flags of the Indian diaspora. 
The drizzling light blew across the savannah   
darkening the racehorses’ hides; mist slowly erased   
the royal palms on the crests of the hills and the 
hills themselves. The brown patches the horses had grazed   
shone as wet as their hides. A skittish stallion   
jerked at his bridle, marble-eyed at the thunder 
muffling the hills, but the groom was drawing him in   
like a fisherman, wrapping the slack line under   
one fist, then with the other tightening the rein 
and narrowing the circle. The sky cracked asunder   
and a forked tree flashed, and suddenly that black rain   
which can lose an entire archipelago 
in broad daylight was pouring tin nails on the roof,   
hammering the balcony. I closed the French window,   
and thought of the horses in their stalls with one hoof 
tilted, watching the ropes of rain. I lay in bed
with current gone from the bed-lamp and heard the roar   
of wind shaking the windows, and I remembered 
Achille on his own mattress and desperate Hector   
trying to save his canoe, I thought of Helen   
as my island lost in the haze, and I was sure 
I’d never see her again. All of a sudden
the rain stopped and I heard the sluicing of water   
down the guttering. I opened the window when 
the sun came out. It replaced the tiny brooms   
of palms on the ridges. On the red galvanized
roof of the paddock, the wet sparkled, then the grooms 
led the horses over the new grass and exercised   
them again, and there was a different brightness   
in everything, in the leaves, in the horses’ eyes.   II 
I smelt the leaves threshing at the top of the year   
in green January over the orange villas   
and military barracks where the Plunketts were, 
the harbour flecked by the wind that comes with Christmas,   
edged with the Arctic, that was christened Vent Noël;   
it stayed until March and, with luck, until Easter. 
It freshened the cedars, waxed the laurier-cannelle,   
and hid the African swift. I smelt the drizzle
on the asphalt leaving the Morne, it was the smell 
of an iron on damp cloth; I heard the sizzle   
of fried jackfish in oil with their coppery skin;
I smelt ham studded with cloves, the crusted accra, 
the wax in the varnished parlour: Come in. Come in,   
the arm of the Morris chair sticky with lacquer;   
I saw a sail going out and a sail coming in, 
and a breeze so fresh it lifted the lace curtains   
like a petticoat, like a sail towards Ithaca;   
I smelt a dead rivulet in the clogged drains.   III 
Ah, twin-headed January, seeing either tense:   
a past, they assured us, born in degradation,   
and a present that lifted us up with the wind’s 
noise in the breadfruit leaves with such an elation   
that it contradicts what is past! The cannonballs   
of rotting breadfruit from the Battle of the Saints, 
the asterisks of bulletholes in the brick walls   
of the redoubt. I lived there with every sense.
I smelt with my eyes, I could see with my nostrils.    Chapter XLV  I 
One side of the coast plunges its precipices   
into the Atlantic. Turns require wide locks,
since the shoulder is sharp and the curve just misses 
a long drop over the wind-bent trees and the rocks   
between the trees. There is a wide view of Dennery,   
with its stone church and raw ochre cliffs at whose base 
the African breakers end. Across the flecked sea
whose combers veil and unveil the rocks with their lace   
the next port is Dakar. The uninterrupted wind 
thuds under the wings of frigates, you see them bent   
from a force that has crossed the world, tilting to find   
purchase in the sudden downdrafts of its current. 
The breeze threshed the palms on the cool December road   
where the Comet hurtled with empty leopard seats,   
so fast a man on a donkey trying to read 
its oncoming fiery sign heard only two thudding beats   
from the up-tempo zouk that its stereo played
when it screeched round a bridge and began to ascend 
away from the palm-fronds and their wickerwork shade   
that left the windscreen clear as it locked round the bend,   
where Hector suddenly saw the trotting piglet 
and thought of Plunkett’s warning as he heard it screel   
with the same sound that the tires of the Comet
made rounding the curve from the sweat-greased steering wheel. 
The rear wheels spin to a dead stop, like a helm.   
The piglet trots down the safer side of the road.
Lodged in their broken branches the curled letters flame. 
Hector had both hands on the wheel. His head was bowed   
under the swaying statue of the Madonna   
of the Rocks, her smile swayed under the blue hood, 
and when her fluted robe stilled, the smile stayed on her   
dimpled porcelain. She saw, in the bowed man, the calm   
common oval of prayer, the head’s usual angle 
over the pew of the dashboard. Her lifted palm,   
small as a doll’s from its cerulean mantle,   
indicated that he had prayed enough to the lace 
of foam round the cliff’s altar, that now, if he wished,   
he could lift his head, but he stayed in the same place,   
the way a man will remain when Mass is finished, 
not unclenching his hands or freeing one to cross   
forehead, heart, and shoulders swiftly and then kneel   
facing the altar. He bowed in endless remorse, 
for her mercy at what he had done to Achille,   
his brother. But his arc was over, for the course   
of every comet is such. The fated crescent 
was printed on the road by the scorching tires.
A salt tear ran down the porcelain cheek and it went
in one slow drop to the clenched knuckle that still gripped 
the wheel. On the flecked sea, the uninterrupted   
wind herded the long African combers, and whipped   
the small flag of the island on its silver spearhead.   II 
Drivers leant over the rail. One seized my luggage   
off the porter’s cart. The rest burst into patois,   
with gestures of despair at the lost privilege 
of driving me, then turned to other customers.
In the evening pastures horses grazed, their hides wet   
with light that shot its lances over the combers. 
I had the transport all to myself.
                                                   “You all set?
Good. A good pal of mine died in that chariot   
of his called the Comet.”
                                     He turned in the front seat, 
spinning the air with his free hand. I sat, sprawled out   
in the back, discouraging talk, with my crossed feet.   
“You never know when, eh? I was at the airport 
that day. I see him take off like a rocket.
I always said that thing have too much horsepower.   
And so said, so done. The same hotel, chief, correct?” 
I saw the coastal villages receding as
the highway’s tongue translated bush into forest,   
the wild savannah into moderate pastures, 
that other life going in its “change for the best,”   
its peace paralyzed in a postcard, a concrete   
future ahead of it all, in the cinder-blocks 
of hotel development with the obsolete
craft of the carpenter, as I sensed, in the neat   
marinas, the fisherman’s phantom. Old oarlocks 
and rusting fretsaw. My craft required the same   
crouching care, the same crabbed, natural devotion   
of the hand that stencilled a flowered window-frame 
or planed an elegant canoe; its time was gone   
with the spirit in the wood, as wood grew obsolete
and plasterers smoothed the blank page of white concrete. 
I watched the afternoon sea. Didn’t I want the poor   
to stay in the same light so that I could transfix   
them in amber, the afterglow of an empire, 
preferring a shed of palm-thatch with tilted sticks   
to that blue bus-stop? Didn’t I prefer a road
from which tracks climbed into the thickening syntax 
of colonial travellers, the measured prose I read
as a schoolboy? That cove, with its brown shallows   
there, Praslin? That heron? Had they waited for me 
to develop my craft? Why hallow that pretence   
of preserving what they left, the hypocrisy   
of loving them from hotels, a biscuit-tin fence 
smothered in love-vines, scenes to which I was attached   
as blindly as Plunkett with his remorseful research?   
Art is History’s nostalgia, it prefers a thatched 
roof to a concrete factory, and the huge church
above a bleached village. The gap between the driver   
and me increased when he said:
                                              “The place changing, eh?” 
where an old rumshop had gone, but not that river
with its clogged shadows. That would make me a stranger.   
“All to the good,” he said. I said, “All to the good,” 
then, “whoever they are,” to myself. I caught his eyes   
in the mirror. We were climbing out of Micoud.   
Hadn’t I made their poverty my paradise? 
His back could have been Hector’s, ferrying tourists   
in the other direction home, the leopard seat
scratching their damp backs like the fur-covered armrests. 
He had driven his burnt-out cargo, tired of sweat,
who longed for snow on the moon and didn’t have to face   
the heat of that sinking sun, who knew a climate 
as monotonous as this one could only produce   
from its unvarying vegetation flashes   
of a primal insight like those red-pronged lilies 
that shot from the verge, that their dried calabashes   
of fake African masks for a fake Achilles
rattled with the seeds that came from other men’s minds. 
So let them think that. Who needed art in this place   
where even the old women strode with stiff-backed spines,   
and the fishermen had such adept thumbs, such grace 
these people had, but what they envied most in them   
was the calypso part, the Caribbean lilt   
still in the shells of their ears, like the surf’s rhythm, 
until too much happiness was shadowed with guilt   
like any Eden, and they sighed at the sign:    HEWANNORRA (Iounalao), the gold sea 
flat as a credit-card, extending its line
to a beach that now looked just like everywhere else,   
Greece or Hawaii. Now the goddamn souvenir 
felt absurd, excessive. The painted gourds, the shells.   
Their own faces as brown as gourds. Mine felt as strange   
as those at the counter feeling their bodies change.   III 
Change lay in our silence. We had come to that bend   
where the trees are warped by wind, and the cliffs, raw,   
shelve surely to foam.
                                 “Is right here everything end,” 
the driver said, and rammed open the transport door   
on his side, then mine.
                                  “Anyway, chief, the view nice.”   
I joined him at the gusting edge.
                                                 “His name was Hector.” 
The name was bent like the trees on the precipice   
to point inland. In its echo a man-o’-war
screamed on the wind. The driver moved off for a piss, 
then shouted over his shoulder:
                                              “A road-warrior.
He would drive like a madman when the power took.   
He had a nice woman. Maybe he died for her.” 
For her and tourism, I thought. The driver shook   
himself, zipping then hoisting his crotch.
                                                               “Crazy, but   
a gentle fellow anyway, with a very good brain.” 
Cut to a leopard galloping on a dry plain   
across Serengeti. Cut to the spraying fans   
drummed by a riderless stallion, its wild mane 
scaring the Scamander. Cut to a woman’s hands
clenched towards her mouth with no sound. Cut to the wheel   
of a chariot’s spiked hubcap. Cut to the face 
of his muscling jaw, then flashback to Achille   
hurling a red tin and a cutlass. Next, a vase   
with a girl’s hoarse whisper echoing “Omeros,” 
as in a conch-shell. Cut to a shield of silver   
rolling like a hubcap. Rewind, in slow motion,   
myrmidons gathering by a village river 
with lances for oars. Cut to the surpliced ocean   
droning its missal. Cut. A crane hoisting a wreck.   
A horse nosing the surf, then shuddering its neck. 
He’d paid the penalty of giving up the sea
as graceless and as treacherous as it had seemed,   
for the taxi-business; he was making money, 
but all of that money was making him ashamed   
of the long afternoons of shouting by the wharf   
hustling passengers. He missed the uncertain sand 
under his feet, he sighed for the trough of a wave,   
and the jerk of the oar when it turned in his hand,   
and the rose conch sunset with its low pelicans. 
Castries was corrupting him with its roaring life,   
its littered market, with too many transport vans   
competing. Castries had been his common-law wife 
who, like Helen, he had longed for from a distance,   
and now he had both, but a frightening discontent   
hollowed his face; to find that the sea was a love 
he could never lose made every gesture violent:   
ramming the side-door shut, raking the clutch. He drove   
as if driven by furies, but furies paid the rent. 
A man who cursed the sea had cursed his own mother.    Mer was both mother and sea. In his lost canoe   
he had said his prayers. But now he was in another 
kind of life that was changing him with his brand-new   
stereo, its endless garages, where he could not
whip off his shirt, hearing the conch’s summoning note.    Chapter XLVI  I 
Hector was buried near the sea he had loved once.   
Not too far from the shallows where he fought Achille   
for a tin and Helen. He did not hear the sea-almond’s 
moan over the bay when Philoctete blew the shell,   
nor the one drumbeat of a wave-thud, nor a sail   
rattling to rest as its day’s work was over, 
and its mate, gauging depth, bent over the gunwale,   
then wearily sounding the fathoms with an oar,
the same rite his shipmates would repeat soon enough 
when it was their turn to lie quiet as Hector,   
lowering a pitch-pine canoe in the earth’s trough,
to sleep under the piled conchs, through every weather 
on the violet-wreathed mound. Crouching for his friend to hear,   
Achille whispered about their ancestral river,   
and those things he would recognize when he got there, 
his true home, forever and ever and ever,   
forever, compère. Then Philoctete limped over   
and rested his hand firmly on a shaking shoulder 
to anchor his sorrow. Seven Seas and Helen   
did not come nearer. Achille had carried an oar
to the church and propped it outside with the red tin. 
Now his voice strengthened. He said: “Mate, this is your spear,”
and laid the oar slowly, the same way he had placed   
the parallel oars in the hull of the gommier 
the day the African swift and its shadow raced.
And this was the prayer that Achille could not utter:   
“The spear that I give you, my friend, is only wood. 
Vexation is past. I know how well you treat her.   
You never know my admiration, when you stood   
crossing the sun at the bow of the long canoe 
with the plates of your chest like a shield; I would say   
any enemy so was a compliment. ’Cause no   
African ever hurled his wide seine at the bay 
by which he was born with such beauty. You hear me? Men   
did not know you like me. All right. Sleep good. Good night.”   
Achille moved Philoctete’s hand, then he saw Helen 
standing alone and veiled in the widowing light.   
Then he reached down to the grave and lifted the tin   
to her. Helen nodded. A wind blew out the sun.   II 
Pride set in Helen’s face after this, like a stone   
bracketed with Hector’s name; her lips were incised   
by its dates in parenthesis. She seemed more stern, 
more ennobled by distance as she slowly crossed   
the hot street of the village like a distant sail
on the horizon. Grief heightened her. When she smiled 
it was with such distance that it was hard to tell
if she had heard your condolence. It was the child,   
Ma Kilman told them, that made her more beautiful.   III 
The rites of the island were simplified by its elements,
which changed places. The grooved sea was Achille’s garden,   
the ridged plot of rattling plantains carried their sense 
of the sea, and Philoctete, on his height, often heard, in   
a wind that suddenly churned the rage of deep gorges,   
the leafy sound of far breakers plunging with smoke, 
and for smoke there were the bonfires which the sun catches   
on the blue heights at sunrise, doing the same work   
as Philoctete clearing his plot, just as, at sunset, 
smoke came from the glowing rim of the horizon as if   
from his enamel pot. The woodsmoke smelt of a regret   
that men cannot name. On the charred field, the massive 
sawn trunks burnt slowly like towers, and the great
indigo dusk slowly plumed down, devouring the still leaves,   
igniting the firefly huts, lifting the panicky egret 
to beat its lagoon and shelve in the cage of the mangroves,   
take in the spars of its sails, then with quick-pricking head   
anchor itself shiftingly, and lift its question again. 
At night, the island reversed its elements, the heron   
of a quarter-moon floated from Hector’s grave, rain   
rose upwards from the sea, and the corrugated iron 
of the sea glittered with nailheads. Ragged
plantains bent and stepped with their rustling powers   
over the furrows of Philoctete’s garden, a chorus of aged 
ancestors and straw, and, rustling, surrounded every house   
in the village with its back garden, with its rank midden
of rusted chamber pots, rotting nets, and the moon’s cold basin. 
They sounded, when they shook, after the moonlit meridian   
of their crossing, like the night-surf; they gazed in   
silence at the shadows of their lamplit children. 
At Philoctete, groaning and soaking the flower on his shin   
with hot sulphur, cleaning its edges with yellow Vaseline,   
and, gripping his knee, squeezing rags from the basin. 
At night, when yards are asleep, and the broken line
of the surf hisses like Philo, “Bon Dieu, aie, waie, my sin   
is this sore?” the old plantains suffer and shine.    Chapter XLVII  I 
Islands of bay leaves in the medicinal bath   
of a cauldron, a sibylline cure. The citron   
sprig of a lime-tree dividing the sky in half 
dipped its divining rod. The white spray of the thorn,   
which the swift bends lightly, waited for a black hand   
to break it in bits and boil its leaves for the wound 
from the pronged anchor rusting in clean bottom-sand.   
Ma Kilman, in a black hat with its berried fringe,   
eased herself sideways down the broken concrete step 
of the rumshop’s back door, closed it, and rammed the hinge   
tight. The bolt caught a finger and with that her instep   
arch twisted and she let out a soft Catholic 
curse, then crossed herself. She closed the gate. The asphalt   
sweated with the heat, the limp breadfruit leaves were thick   
over the fence. Her spectacles swam in their sweat. 
She plucked an armpit. The damn wig was badly made.   
She was going to five o’clock Mass, to la Messe,   
and sometimes she had to straighten it as she prayed 
until the wafer dissolved her with tenderness,
the way a raindrop melts on the tongue of a breeze.
In the church’s cool cave the sweat dried from her eyes. 
She rolled down the elastic bands below the knees   
of her swollen stockings. It was then that their vise   
round her calves reminded her of Philoctete. Then, 
numbering her beads, she began her own litany   
of berries, Hail Mary marigolds that stiffen   
their aureoles in the heights, mild anemone 
and clear watercress, the sacred heart of Jesus   
pierced like the anthurium, the thorns of logwood,   
called the tree of life, the aloe good for seizures, 
the hole in the daisy’s palm, with its drying blood   
that was the hole in the fisherman’s shin since he was   
pierced by a hook; there was the pale, roadside tisane 
of her malarial childhood. There was this one
for easing a birth-breach, that one for a love-bath,   
before the buds of green sugar-apples in the sun 
ripened like her nipples in girlhood. But what path   
led through nettles to the cure, the furious sibyl   
couldn’t remember. Mimosa winced from her fingers, 
shutting like jalousies at some passing evil
when she reached for them. The smell of incense lingers   
in her clothes. Inside, the candle-flames are erect 
round the bier of the altar while she and her friends   
old-talk on the steps, but the plant keeps its secret   
when her memory reaches, shuttering in its fronds.   II 
The dew had not yet dried on the white-ribbed awnings   
and the nodding palanquins of umbrella yams   
where the dark grove had not heat but early mornings 
of perpetual freshness, in which the bearded arms   
of a cedar held council. Between its gnarled toes
grew the reek of an unknown weed; its pronged flower 
sprang like a buried anchor; its windborne odours   
diverted the bee from its pollen, but its power,
rooted in bitterness, drew her bowed head by the nose 
as a spike does a circling bull. To approach it
Ma Kilman lowered her head to one side and screened   
the stench with a cologned handkerchief. The mulch it 
was rooted in carried the smell, when it gangrened,   
of Philoctete’s cut. In her black dress, her berried   
black hat, she climbed a goat-path up from the village, 
past the stones with dried palms and conchs, where the buried   
suffer the sun all day Sunday, while goats forage   
the new wreaths. Once more she pulled at the itch in her 
armpits, nearly dropping her purse. Then she climbed hard   
up the rain-cracked path, the bay closing behind her   
like a wound, and rested. Everything that echoed 
repeated its outline: a goat’s doddering bleat,
a hammer multiplying a roof, and, through the back yards,   
a mother cursing a boy too nimble to beat. 
Ma Kilman picked up her purse and sighed on upwards   
to the thread of the smell, one arm behind her back,   
passing the cactus, the thorn trees, and then the wood 
appeared over her, thick green, the green almost black   
as her dress in its shade, its border of flowers
flecking the pasture with spray. Then she staggered back 
from the line of ants at her feet. She saw the course   
they had kept behind her, following her from church,   
signalling a language she could not recognize.   III 
A swift had carried the strong seed in its stomach   
centuries ago from its antipodal shore,
skimming the sea-troughs, outdarting ospreys, her luck 
held to its shadow. She aimed to carry the cure   
that precedes every wound; the reversible Bight   
of Benin was her bow, her target the ringed haze 
of a circling horizon. The star-grains at night   
made her hungrier; the leafless sea with no house   
for her weariness. Sometimes she dozed in her flight 
for a swift’s second, closing the seeds of her stare,
then ruddering straight. The dry sea-flakes whitened her   
breast, her feathers thinned. Then, one dawn the day-star 
rose slowly from the wrong place and it frightened her   
because all the breakers were blowing from the wrong   
east. She saw the horned island and uncurled her claws 
with one frail cry, since swifts are not given to song,   
and fluttered down to a beach, ejecting the seed   
in grass near the sand. She nestled in dry seaweed. 
In a year she was bleached bone. All of that motion   
a pile of fragile ash from the fire of her will,   
but the vine grew its own wings, out of the ocean 
it climbed like the ants, the ancestors of Achille,   
the women carrying coals after the dark door   
slid over the hold. As the weed grew in odour 
so did its strength at the damp root of the cedar,   
where the flower was anchored at the mottled root   
as a lizard crawled upwards, foot by sallow foot.

Perfect little body, without fault or stain on thee,
   With promise of strength and manhood full and fair!
       Though cold and stark and bare,The bloom and the charm of life doth awhile remain on thee.
Thy mother’s treasure wert thou;—alas! no longer
   To visit her heart with wondrous joy; to be
       Thy father’s pride;—ah, heMust gather his faith together, and his strength make stronger.
To me, as I move thee now in the last duty,
   Dost thou with a turn or gesture anon respond;
       Startling my fancy fondWith a chance attitude of the head, a freak of beauty.
Thy hand clasps, as ’twas wont, my finger, and holds it:
   But the grasp is the clasp of Death, heartbreaking and stiff;
       Yet feels to my hand as if’Twas still thy will, thy pleasure and trust that enfolds it.
So I lay thee there, thy sunken eyelids closing,—
   Go lie thou there in thy coffin, thy last little bed!—
       Propping thy wise, sad head,Thy firm, pale hands across thy chest disposing.
So quiet! doth the change content thee?—Death, whither hath he taken thee?
   To a world, do I think, that rights the disaster of this?
       The vision of which I miss,Who weep for the body, and wish but to warm thee and awaken thee?
Ah! little at best can all our hopes avail us
   To lift this sorrow, or cheer us, when in the dark,
       Unwilling, alone we embark,And the things we have seen and have known and have heard of, fail us.

As Hermes once took to his feathers light,

  So play’d, so charm’d, so conquer’d, so bereftThe dragon-world of all its hundred eyes;
  And seeing it asleep, so fled away,Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies,
  Nor unto Tempe where Jove griev’d that day;But to that second circle of sad Hell,
  Where in the gust, the whirlwind, and the flawOf rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell
  Their sorrows—pale were the sweet lips I saw,Pale were the lips I kiss’d, and fair the formI floated with, about that melancholy storm.

See how the orient dew, Shed from the bosom of the morn      Into the blowing roses, Yet careless of its mansion new, For the clear region where ’twas born      Round in itself incloses:    And in its little globe’s extent, Frames as it can its native element.    How it the purple flow’r does slight,         Scarce touching where it lies,    But gazing back upon the skies,         Shines with a mournful light,          Like its own tear, Because so long divided from the sphere.    Restless it rolls and unsecure,       Trembling lest it grow impure,    Till the warm sun pity its pain,   And to the skies exhale it back again.       So the soul, that drop, that ray   Of the clear fountain of eternal day,   Could it within the human flow’r be seen,       Remembering still its former height,       Shuns the sweet leaves and blossoms green,       And recollecting its own light, Does, in its pure and circling thoughts, express The greater heaven in an heaven less.         In how coy a figure wound,         Every way it turns away:         So the world excluding round,         Yet receiving in the day,       Dark beneath, but bright above,       Here disdaining, there in love.    How loose and easy hence to go,    How girt and ready to ascend,    Moving but on a point below,    It all about does upwards bend. Such did the manna’s sacred dew distill,   White and entire, though congealed and chill,   Congealed on earth : but does, dissolving, run   Into the glories of th’ almighty sun.

That which her slender waist confin’d,Shall now my joyful temples bind;No monarch but would give his crown,His arms might do what this has done.
It was my heaven’s extremest sphere,The pale which held that lovely deer,My joy, my grief, my hope, my love,Did all within this circle move.
A narrow compass, and yet thereDwelt all that’s good, and all that’s fair;Give me but what this ribbon bound,Take all the rest the sun goes round.

July 1965



As the sheriff remarked: I had no business being there. He was right, but for the wrong reasons. Among that odd crew of volunteers from the North, I was by far the most inept and least effective. I couldn’t have inspired or assisted a woodchuck to vote.
       In fact, when the sheriff’s buddies nabbed me on the highway east of Selma, I’d just been released from ten days of jail in Mississippi. I was fed up and terrified; I was actually fleeing north and glad to go. 
       - 
   In Jackson, they’d been ready for the demonstration. After the peaceful arrests, after the news cameras recorded us being quietly ushered onto trucks, the doors were closed and we headed for the county fairgrounds.
       Once we passed its gates, it was a different story: the truck doors opened on a crowd of state troopers waiting to greet us with their nightsticks out. Smiles beneath mirrored sunglasses and blue riot helmets; smiles above badges taped so numbers didn’t show.
       For the next twenty minutes, they clubbed us, and it kept up at intervals, more or less at random, all that afternoon and into the evening.
       Next morning we woke to new guards who did not need to conceal their names or faces. A little later, the fbi arrived to ask if anyone had specific complaints about how they’d been treated and by whom.
       But late that first night, as we sat bolt upright in rows on the concrete floor of the cattle barn waiting for mattresses to arrive, one last precise event: A guard stopped in front of the ten-year-old black kid next to me. He pulled a freedom now pin from the kid’s shirt, made him put it in his mouth, then ordered him to swallow. 
       - 
   That stakeout at dusk on Route 80 east of Selma was intended for someone else, some imaginary organizer rumored to be headed toward their dismal, godforsaken town. Why did they stop me?
       The New York plates, perhaps, and that little bit of stupidity: the straw hat I wore, a souvenir of Mississippi.
       Siren-wail from an unmarked car behind me—why should I think they were cops? I hesitated, then pulled to the shoulder. The two who jumped out waved pistols, but wore no uniforms or badges. By then, my doors were locked, my windows rolled. Absurd sound of a pistol barrel rapping the glass three inches from my face: “Get out, you son of a bitch, or we’ll blow your head off.”
       When they found pamphlets on the backseat they were sure they’d got the right guy. The fat one started poking my stomach with his gun, saying, “Boy, we’re gonna dump you in the swamp.” 
       - 
   It was a long ride through the dark, a ride full of believable threats, before they arrived at that hamlet with its cinderblock jail.
       He was very glad to see it, that adolescent I was twenty years ago. For eight days he cowered in his solitary cell, stinking of dirt and fear. He’s cowering there still, waiting for me to come back and release him by turning his terror into art. But consciously or not, he made his choice and he’s caught in history.
       And if I reach back now, it’s only to hug him and tell him to be brave, to remember that black kid who sat beside him in the Mississippi darkness. And to remember that silence shared by guards and prisoners alike as they watched in disbelief the darkness deepening around the small shape in his mouth, the taste of metal, the feel of the pin against his tongue.
       It’s too dark for it to matter what’s printed on the pin; it’s too dark for anything but the brute fact that someone wants him to choke to death on its hard shape.
       And still he refuses to swallow.

We won’t pretend we’re not hungry for distinction
but what can ever distinguish us enough?
This country, this language won’t last long, the race
will die, later the cockroach, earth itself, 
and last this beer bottle: silicon fused by man,
almost indestructible, like a soul:
it will go spinning ever farther from the nearest thing
until space, continually deepening, drowns in itself. 
Yet we keep a hungry eye on old schoolmates
and everyone born in the year of our own birth,
and spend the nights in ranting over them,
their money, fashionable companions, pliant critics. 
To live just a little longer than they do:
that would be triumph. Hence exercise and diets,
and the squabble over who will write the history
of this paradise of demons casting each other out.

I 
In a detachment cool as the glint of light
on wet roads through wet spruce, or iced mountains
hailed from the sea in moonfill, or the sea
when one horizon’s black and the other burning; 
the gulls are kissing time in its own flowing
over the shell-scraped rock   a coming and going
as of glass bees with a bubble of light in each
running errands in and out of the sunset. 
Over the road and the spruce wood, over the ice,
and out the picture of my picture window,
the exorbitant separation of nature from nature
wheels, whirls, and dances on itself. 
Now damn me for a moral. Over and out,
over and in, the gulls drift up afire,
screaming like hinges in the broken air
of night and day like two smokes on the sea. 
And I do nothing. A shadow three feet under
my window in the light, I look at light
in one of the years of my life. This or another.
Or all together. Or simply in this moment.  
II 
Lead flags of the sea. Steel furls of the surf.
Day smoke and night smoke. Fire at the smoke’s top.
A passion from the world in a calm eye.
A calm of the world in the eye of passion. 
The day that sank birdless from staring Calvary
was another. And only another. And no other
than the clucking calm of Eden fussed to rest
from the black bush afire in the first eye. 
A calm-in-violence like Aegean time.
Day smoke and night smoke over the palled sea
tensed for a clash of tridents. Far ashore,
a staring army camped beside a temple, 
the base of the temple black with powder stains,
the pediment flashing wild in light above.
—A day of the world in which a part of the world
looked at another, two parts of a mist. 
At Cassino the dusty German wetting his lips,
his eyes crashed in his face like unhatched birds’ eggs
splashed from their nest, looked East from the burning night.
There was no West. Light came from nowhere behind him, 
slanted, flowed level, drained. He looked out, waiting.
Where had it come from, the light of his terrible patience?
A dead man waited to die on the shell-scraped
stones of another God, dust of the stones 
caked to his body, rivers of blood within him
ran to their dusty sea beside the world.
Calm in his changes, risen from his changes,
he looked his life out at the smoking world.  
III 
I have no more to do than what I wait for
under the changing light and the gulls afire
in rays of rose-quartz. Holy ghosts of the sea, 
they rise in light from behind me. The light lifts
long from the edge of the world and juts away
over the top of the dark. My life sits 
visible to itself; and I sit still
in a company of survivors and the dead.
Jew. Greek, German, man at the edge of himself 
in the long light over the worlds he ran to
to save unsaved. I practice the man in all,
clutching the world from the world to praise it.

I grieve and dare not show my discontent,
I love and yet am forced to seem to hate,
I do, yet dare not say I ever meant,
I seem stark mute but inwardly do prate.
I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned,
Since from myself another self I turned. 
My care is like my shadow in the sun,
Follows me flying, flies when I pursue it,
Stands and lies by me, doth what I have done.
His too familiar care doth make me rue it.
No means I find to rid him from my breast,
Till by the end of things it be supprest. 
Some gentler passion slide into my mind,
For I am soft and made of melting snow;
Or be more cruel, love, and so be kind.
Let me or float or sink, be high or low.
Or let me live with some more sweet content,
Or die and so forget what love ere meant.

I went out walking
in the old neighborhood 
Look! more trees on the block   
forget-me-nots all around them   
ivy   lantana shining
and geraniums in the window 
Twenty years ago
it was believed that the roots of trees
would insert themselves into gas lines
then fall   poisoned   on houses and children 
or tap the city’s water pipes   starved   
for nitrogen   obstruct the sewers 
In those days in the afternoon I floated   
by ferry to Hoboken or Staten Island   
then pushed the babies in their carriages   
along the river wall   observing Manhattan   
See Manhattan I cried   New York!
even at sunset it doesn’t shine
but stands in fire   charcoal to the waist 
But this Sunday afternoon on Mother’s Day
I walked west   and came to Hudson Street   tricolored flags   
were flying over old oak furniture for sale
brass bedsteads   copper pots and vases
by the pound from India 
Suddenly before my eyes   twenty-two transvestites   
in joyous parade stuffed pillows under   
their lovely gowns
and entered a restaurant
under a sign which said   All Pregnant Mothers Free 
I watched them place napkins over their bellies   
and accept coffee and zabaglione 
I am especially open to sadness and hilarity   
since my father died as a child   
one week ago in this his ninetieth year

Know you fair, on what you look; Divinest love lies in this book, Expecting fire from your eyes, To kindle this his sacrifice. When your hands untie these strings, Think you’have an angel by th’ wings. One that gladly will be nigh, To wait upon each morning sigh. To flutter in the balmy air Of your well-perfumed prayer. These white plumes of his he’ll lend you, Which every day to heaven will send you, To take acquaintance of the sphere, And all the smooth-fac’d kindred there.          And though Herbert’s name do owe          These devotions, fairest, know          That while I lay them on the shrine          Of your white hand, they are mine.

Here lies, to each her parents’ ruth, Mary, the daughter of their youth; Yet all heaven’s gifts being heaven’s due, It makes the father less to rue. At six months’ end she parted hence With safety of her innocence; Whose soul heaven’s queen, whose name she bears, In comfort of her mother’s tears, Hath placed amongst her virgin-train: Where, while that severed doth remain, This grave partakes the fleshly birth; Which cover lightly, gentle earth!


^^EOP^^

Good Heav’n, I thank thee, since it was designedI should be framed, but of the weaker kind,That yet, my Soul, is rescued from the loveOf all those trifles which their passions move.Pleasures and praise and plenty have with meBut their just value. If allowed they be,Freely, and thankfully as much I taste,As will not reason or religion waste,If they’re denied, I on my self can live,And slight those aids unequal chance does give.When in the sun, my wings can be displayed,And, in retirement, I can bless the shade.

When the first mechanical picker had stripped the field,
It left such a copious white dross of disorderly wispiness
That my mother could not console herself to the waste
And insisted on having it picked over with human hands, 
Though anyone could see there was not enough for ten sheets
And the hands had long since gone into the factories.
No matter how often my father pointed this out,
She worried it the way I’ve worried the extra words 
In poems that I conceived with the approximate
Notion that each stanza should have the same number
Of lines and each line the same number of syllables—
And disregarded it, telling myself a ripple 
Or botch on the surface, like the stutter of a speaker,
Is all I have to affirm the deep fluency below.
The Hebrews distrusted Greek poetry (which embodied
Harmony and symmetry, and, therefore, revision) 
Not for aesthetic reasons, but because they believed
That to change the first words, which rose unsmelted
From the trance, amounted to sacrilege against God.
In countries where, because of the gross abundance 
Of labor, it’s unlawful to import harvesting machines,
I see the women in the fields and think of how,
When my mother used to pick, you could tell
Her row by the bare stalks and the scant poundage 
That tumbled from her sack so pristinely white
And devoid of burrs, it seemed to have already
Passed through the spiked mandibles of the gin.
Dr. Williams said of Eliot that his poems were so 
Cautiously wrought that they seemed to come
To us already digested in all four stomachs of the cow.
What my father loved about my mother was not
Just the beauty of her body and face, but the practice 
Of her ideas and the intelligence of her hands
As they made the house that abides in us still
As worry and bother, but also the perfect freedom beyond—
As cleanliness is next to godliness but is not God.

for Jean Brockway



When the walkers-on-water went under,
the bog-walkers came out of the barberry
thickets, booted in gum to their hips,
in a corona of midges, their ears electric
with sound, beating the stale of the swamp
with their whips and flailing the ground
for the itch under the frond, the fern’s
demonology, the mosquito’s decibel. 
Night-sweat clotted their palms. They tasted
their gall. The sumac flickered a swatch
of its leaves in the lichens and venoms,
a dazzle was seen in the fog
as a vegetal world gave way to a uterine,
pitch pulled at their heels and blackened
their knuckles, the bog-laurel’s fan
opened its uttermost decimal and showed them the Bog. 
Paradisal, beyond purpose or menace, dewed
like the flesh of an apple with the damp
of creation, the disk of the pond glowed
under the dragonfly’s bosses, where a faulting
of glaciers had left it—vaults of bog-rosemary,
buckbean and Labrador tea, a dapple
of leavening mosses soaking in ice-water, peat-wicks
feeding their gas to the cranberry braziers. 
They entered the bonfire together. The moss
took their weight like a trampoline:
they walked on the sponge and bitumen without
leaving a footprint. In between,
in the vats of mat-roses where the waterline
closed like a skin, the ambiguous
world of imbalance, non-being, the pre-human
and tentative, was one with the ludicrous. 
The quaking began—under their bootsoles
at first, like a whale under ambergris,
then cramming their wrists with a drummer’s
vibrations, knocking their ribs and their knees
as all sagged and rebounded. They lurched on the wet
as though tracing a profile of breakers
or displacing the cords and the voids of a net,
and staggered back into their childhoods, 
till their feet touched the granite again.
The bog tossed them over the threshold
that opened a path in the spruce toward the opposite
edges. The leaves closed behind them. They walked
an unyielding and tangible world like strangers, remembering
only the hovering glare where the pitcher-plant’s
hammer closed on the fly—the light shaking and shaking—
as a pulse touched their feet from below, and passed over.

How much grit do you think you’ve got?
Can you quit a thing that you like a lot?
You may talk of pluck; it’s an easy word,
And where’er you go it is often heard;
But can you tell to a jot or guess
Just how much courage you now possess? 
You may stand to trouble and keep your grin,
But have you tackled self-discipline?
Have you ever issued commands to you
To quit the things that you like to do,
And then, when tempted and sorely swayed,
Those rigid orders have you obeyed? 
Don’t boast of your grit till you’ve tried it out,
Nor prate to men of your courage stout,
For it’s easy enough to retain a grin
In the face of a fight there’s a chance to win,
But the sort of grit that is good to own
Is the stuff you need when you’re all alone. 
How much grit do you think you’ve got?
Can you turn from joys that you like a lot?
Have you ever tested yourself to know
How far with yourself your will can go?
If you want to know if you have grit,
Just pick out a joy that you like, and quit. 
It’s bully sport and it’s open fight;
It will keep you busy both day and night;
For the toughest kind of a game you’ll find
Is to make your body obey your mind.
And you never will know what is meant by grit
Unless there’s something you’ve tried to quit.

On the beach at night alone, As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song, As I watch the bright stars shining, I think a thought of the clef of the universes and of the future.  A vast similitude interlocks all, All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets, All distances of place however wide, All distances of time, all inanimate forms, All souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different, or in different worlds, All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes, the fishes, the brutes, All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages, All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe, or any globe, All lives and deaths, all of the past, present, future, This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann’d, And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them.

Condemned to Hope’s delusive mine,     As on we toil from day to day, By sudden blasts, or slow decline,     Our social comforts drop away.  Well tried through many a varying year,     See Levet to the grave descend; Officious, innocent, sincere,     Of every friendless name the friend.  Yet still he fills Affection’s eye,     Obscurely wise, and coarsely kind; Nor, lettered Arrogance, deny     Thy praise to merit unrefined.  When fainting Nature called for aid,     And hovering Death prepared the blow, His vigorous remedy displayed     The power of art without the show.  In Misery’s darkest cavern known,     His useful care was ever nigh, Where hopeless Anguish poured his groan,     And lonely Want retired to die.  No summons mocked by chill delay,     No petty gain disdained by pride, The modest wants of every day     The toil of every day supplied.  His virtues walked their narrow round,     Nor made a pause, nor left a void; And sure the Eternal Master found     The single talent well employed.  The busy day, the peaceful night,     Unfelt, uncounted, glided by; His frame was firm, his powers were bright,     Though now his eightieth year was nigh.  Then with no throbbing fiery pain,     No cold gradations of decay, Death broke at once the vital chain,     And freed his soul the nearest way.

As my Scotch, spared the water, blondly sloshes
About its tumbler, and gay manic flame
Is snapping in the fireplace, I grow youthful:
I realize that calendars aren’t truthful
And that for all of my grand unsuccesses
External causes are to blame. 
And if at present somewhat destitute,
I plan to alter, prove myself more able,
And suavely stroll into the coming years
As into rooms with thick rugs, chandeliers,
And colorfully pyramided fruit
On linened lengths of table. 
At times I fear the future won’t reward
My failures with sufficient compensation,
But dump me, aging, in a garret room
Appointed with twilit, slant-ceilinged gloom
And a lone bulb depending from a cord
Suggestive of self-strangulation. 
Then, too, I have bad dreams, in one of which
A cowled, scythe-bearing figure beckons me.
Dark plains glow at his back: it seems I’ve died,
And my soul, weighed and judged, has qualified
For an extended, hyper-sultry hitch
Down in eternity. 
Such fears and dreams, however, always pass.
And gazing from my window at the dark,
My drink in hand, I’m jauntily unbowed.
The sky’s tiered, windy galleries stream with cloud,
And higher still, the dazed stars thickly mass
In their long Ptolemaic arc. 
What constellated powers, unkind or kind,
Sway me, what far preposterous ghosts of air?
Whoever they are, whatever our connection,
I toast them (toasting also my reflection),
Not minding that the words which come to mind
Make the toast less toast than prayer: 
Here’s to the next year, to the best year yet;
To mixed joys, to my harum-scarum prime;
To auguries reliable and specious;
To times to come, such times being precious,
If only for the reason that they get
Shorter all the time.

The castle clock had tolled midnight:
   With mattock and with spade,And silent, by the torches’ light,
   His corse in earth we laid.
  The coffin bore his name, that those
   Of other years might know,When earth its secrets should disclose,
   Whose bones were laid below.
  “Peace to the dead” no children sung,
   Slow pacing up the nave,—No prayers were read, no knell was rung,
   As deep we dug his grave.
  We only heard the winter's wind,
   In many a sullen gust,As, o’er the open grave inclined,
   We murmured, “Dust to dust!”
  A moonbeam from the arch’s height
   Streamed, as we placed the stone;The long aisles started into light,
   And all the windows shone.
  We thought we saw the banners then,
   That shook along the walls,Whilst the sad shades of mailèd men
   Were gazing on the stalls.
  ’Tis gone! again on tombs defaced
   Sits darkness more profound;And only by the torch we traced
   The shadows on the ground.
  And now the chilling, freezing air
   Without blew long and loud;Upon our knees we breathed one prayer,
   Where he slept in his shroud.
  We laid the broken marble floor,—
   No name, no trace appears,—And when we closed the sounding door,
   We thought of him with tears.

Child! do not throw this book about!   
   Refrain from the unholy pleasure   
Of cutting all the pictures out!
   Preserve it as your chiefest treasure. 
Child, have you never heard it said   
   That you are heir to all the ages?
Why, then, your hands were never made
   To tear these beautiful thick pages! 
Your little hands were made to take
   The better things and leave the worse ones:   
They also may be used to shake
   The Massive Paws of Elder Persons. 
And when your prayers complete the day,   
   Darling, your little tiny hands
Were also made, I think, to pray   
   For men that lose their fairylands.

After a night of wind we are surprised
by the light, how it flutters up from the back of the sea
and leaves us at ease. We can walk along the shore
this way or that, all day. Sit in the spiky grass
among the low whittled bushes, listening
to crickets, to the whisk of the small waves,
the rattling back of stones. “Observation,”
our Golden Nature Guide instructs, is the key to science.
Look all around you. Some beaches
may be quite barren except for things washed up.”
A buoy and a blue bottle, a lightbulb
cloudy but unbroken. For an hour
my daughter gathers trinkets, bits of good luck.
She sings the song she’s just invented:
Everybody knows when the old days come.
Although it is October, today falls into the shape
of summer, that sense of languid promise
in which we are offered another
and then another spell of flawless weather.
It is the weather of Sundays,
the weather of memory, and I can see
myself sitting on a porch looking
out at water, the discreet shores
of a lake. Three or four white pines
were enough of a mystery, how they shook
and whispered, how at night I felt them
leaning against my window, like the beginning
of a story in which children must walk
deeper and deeper into a dark forest,
and are afraid, yet calm, unaware
of the arrangements made for them to survive.
My daughter counts her shells and stones,
my wife clips bayberry from the pathway. I raise
an old pair of binoculars, follow the edge of the sky
to the lighthouse, then down into the waves as they
fold around rocks humped up out of the sea.
I can turn the wheel and blur it all
into a dazzle, the pure slips and shards of light.
“A steady push of wind,” we read in the book,
“gives water its rolling, rising and falling motion.
As the sea moves up and down, the wave itself
moves forward. As it nears the shore friction
from the bottom causes it to rise higher
until it tips forward in an arc and breaks.”
On the table in front of the house
is the day’s collection: sea-glass
and starfish, a pink claw, that blue bottle—
some to be taken home, arranged in a box,
laid on a shelf, later rediscovered, later
thrown away, casually, without regret,
and some of it, even now, to be discarded,
like the lesser stones, and the pale
chipped shells which are so alike
we can agree that saving one or two will be enough.

A Rock, A River, A Tree
Hosts to species long since departed,   
Marked the mastodon,
The dinosaur, who left dried tokens   
Of their sojourn here
On our planet floor,
Any broad alarm of their hastening doom   
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages. 
But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,   
Come, you may stand upon my
Back and face your distant destiny,
But seek no haven in my shadow,
I will give you no hiding place down here. 
You, created only a little lower than
The angels, have crouched too long in   
The bruising darkness
Have lain too long
Facedown in ignorance,
Your mouths spilling words
Armed for slaughter. 
The Rock cries out to us today,   
You may stand upon me,   
But do not hide your face.

If honor to an ancient name be due, Or riches challenge it for one that’s new, The British language claims in either sense Both for its age, and for its opulence. But all great things must be from us removed, To be with higher reverence beloved. So landskips which in prospects distant lie, With greater wonder draw the pleasèd eye. Is not great Troy to one dark ruin hurled? Once the fam’d scene of all fighting world. Where’s Athens now, to whom Rome learning owes, And the safe laurels that adorned her brows? A strange reverse of fate she did endure, Never once greater, than she’s now obscure. Even Rome her self can but some footsteps show Of Scipio’s times, or those of Cicero. And as the Roman and the Grecian state, The British fell, the spoil of time and fate. But though the language hath the beauty lost, Yet she has still some great remains to boast. For ’twas in that, the sacred bards of old, In deathless numbers did their thoughts unfold. In groves, by rivers, and on fertile plains, They civilized and taught the listening swains; Whilst with high raptures, and as great success, Virtue they clothed in music’s charming dress. This Merlin spoke, who in his gloomy cave, Even Destiny her self seemed to enslave. For to his sight the future time was known, Much better than to others is their own; And with such state, predictions from him fell, As if he did decree, and not foretell. This spoke King Arthur, who, if fame be true, Could have compelled mankind to speak it too. In this once Boadicca valor taught, And spoke more nobly than her soldiers fought: Tell me what hero could be more than she, Who fell at once for fame and liberty? Nor could a greater sacrifice belong, Or to her children’s, or her country’s wrong. This spoke Caractacus, who was so brave, That to the Roman fortune check he gave: And when their yoke he could decline no more, He it so decently and nobly wore, That Rome her self with blushes did believe, A Britain would the law of honor give; And hastily his chains away she threw, Lest her own captive else should her subdue.

After lockdown, tier by tier undresses to sleep:
Each skull nestles in its mattress-hollow.
Wall facing wall inside of wall shrinks to a keyhole:
A fly creeps through and starts to buzz, reeling through bars
Down steel corridors. A dreamer’s eye follows the fly,
And wherever the fly lands, the eye touches down
With an airier Midas touch that turns all to glass:
The eye wakes to Bentham’s panopticon, glazed cage
Of an inspection house where only the Warden sees all. 
—I am asleep and not asleep,
I stare up into faces swarming: 
Cellblocks of memory focus face by face,
Mine flitting in and out of theirs: In prison issue
They come, footsteps mingling over mine in a child’s game
Of chase from yard to cell, only we’re all grown men,
Meatier, less and more malign than
A boy’s imagining himself grown... 
—I was asleep and not asleep,
Faces came and went. 
Frank the Joker, the West Virginia biker, who composed
“A rhyme to fit the crime”:
“There was a young fellow named Frank
Who gave his girlfriend a spank;
She fell in a heap
In front of Frank’s jeep
And old Frank ran her down for a prank.” 
Or the white-haired lifer, densley oracular:
“Sometimes, after lockdown, your thoughts
Just don’t have the energy to climb the wall.” 
The Giggler who bolted
His brother in a barn and burned it down,
Eyes challenging, sly:
“They killed this guy and see, I think this is funny, hilarious
In fact, but you, you won’t think so—they cut off his dick
And shoved it in his mouth.” 
Or the child molester who said about flowers
At funerals: “They’re there, aren’t they,
To hide the stink off the corpse?” 
Or Pat, armed robber
Who held aloof: Rolled shirtsleeves, forearms
Carved from basalt, smoke rings
Lazily effusing:
“The johns here, they got no doors:
You ever try to take a shit while someone’s watching?
It took six months to get used to that—
But here, man, the bars feed on
Time, they nibble
It to nothing.” 
—I wanted to sleep and couldn’t sleep,
I stared up into faces swarming. 
Three o’clock dark dissolves
The walls, faces start to drift, their atoms
Mix with concrete’s
Atomic swirl, bodies get stuck
Floating halfway through, heartbeats
Booming as through a stethoscope: 
Like Michaelangelo’s slaves, if a fly
Landed on their noses,
They couldn’t lift a hand to brush it off. 
Dark velleities buzz in this hive of steel
Where power handshakes
Flower in forests
Of interlocking fingers: 
In red prison uniform, a man
On death row, convicted 1984, exonerated and pardoned
October 2000 (New York Times, Dec. 10):
“You could hear the humming of the chair
Every time they cut it on, like an air-conditioner
Cutting on. My daddy came to see me, he said, ‘What's that?’
I said, ‘The chair.’ The way they put it, they got to test the chair.” 
—I was asleep
And couldn’t wake up. 
Inside my skull, glass
Keeps shattering: Dream-beings
Unsubscribed to the will, with insect bodies
And human heads, dash against walls, mammal softness
Of cheeks and lips join with stingers
Pulsing...my eyes awake and not awake, where is the chamber
As in the horror movie Return of the Fly that, circuitry and test-tubes
Sparking, would unscramble these divided
Natures? 
(They called me “Teach”
As in “Hey, Teach, how do you spell...”
When I confessed I’d been in jail, they looked disappointed in me:
Their side of the wall was theirs, not mine.) 
—I tried to turn over, to look away,
But couldn’t wake up, couldn’t not wake. 
Chemicals drip into a man’s veins, one each
For heart, lungs, brain.
Strapped to a table, he stares
Impassive, eyes flickering shut, body
A meat wall, IV tubes
Almost empty... 
—I was asleep and not asleep,
I couldn’t move to wake. 
I hear shrill wings—that fly inspecting bread crumbs
Under dining hall tables while the Warden blares
Descartes over the Intercom:
“If a man’s head were lopped off
His mouth would keep on moving, faultlessly
Justifying his crimes.” 
But that fly, that speck against
Steel, its wings steered in ways that seem crazy
To eyes awake, not awake,
Not seeing, all-seeing, the head unmoving
Moving to turn away...oh seely fly
I can’t not see, can’t move to brush away
From my unsleeping eyes, you veer
In spirals unflattened into pathos
Of careening chaos, your eccentric
Flight path darts
Through bars, oh alas, hairy
Vibrant fly!

I ran into the afterlife.
No fluffy white clouds. Not even stars. Only sky
dark as the inside of a movie theater
at three in the afternoon and getting bigger all the time,
expanding at terrific speed
over the car which was disappearing,
flattening out empty
as the fields on either side. 
                                             It was impossible to think
under that rain louder than engines.
I turned off the radio to listen, let my head
fill up until every bone
was vibrating—sky. 
                            Twice, trees of lightning
broke out of the asphalt. I could smell
the highway burning. Long after, saw blue smoke twirling
behind the eyeballs, lariats
doing fancy rope tricks, jerking silver
dollars out of the air, along with billiard cues, ninepins. 
I was starting to feel I could drive forever
when suddenly one of those trees was right in front of me.
Of course, I hit it—
branches shooting stars down the windshield,
poor car shaking like a dazed cow.
I thought this time for sure I was dead
so whatever was on the other side had to be eternity.

They slept and ate like us.
Feral they were not.
The intricacy of their handiwork
bespoke a fineness we’d be taught. 
Yet we wiped them out.
It was eerily easy to do,
although they knew we were coming
and knew we knew they knew. 
Not only did they not resist
our guns like bloody hacking coughs
in their libraries and hospitals,
their bedrooms and their schools— 
they would not acknowledge us.
We felt like fools. There was no keening.
Even the children did not cry.
It was as if meaning 
inhered so deeply in their daily
lives we could not touch it;
nor would they quit living to be
slaughtered, it was so inviolate.

At sunset from the top of the stair watching 
the castle mallets wrenched from their socket 
fell from ambush into flame flew into hiding; 
above the stoneware a latch like muscle hid 
the green; he stood waist high under the rapt 
ceiling and hanged the sparrow; where the kitchen 
had been a mirror of eggs served in a tumbler he 
saw the ring when a lancet pierced and threw it.  
In a basket and lowered it where sails enter 
the harbor over a parchment like dominoes; 
the petrel-like eyelash. 
To the sun and its rites were pulled the dried 
banners; they flew past the ruins the tower 
and window where ivory guided the mist on his back; 
he rubbed his eyes and counted them kneeling 
wrinkled as grass.   A ghost in their nostrils put a heel at their 
forehead; they saw only the moon as it 
fasted.

Our God, our help in ages past,    Our hope for years to come, Our shelter from the stormy blast,    And our eternal home:  Under the shadow of thy throne    Thy saints have dwelt secure; Sufficient is thine arm alone,    And our defense is sure.  Before the hills in order stood    Or earth received her frame, From everlasting thou art God,    To endless years the same.  Thy word commands our flesh to dust,    “Return, ye sons of men”; All nations rose from earth at first,    And turn to earth again.  A thousand ages in thy sight    Are like an evening gone; Short as the watch that ends the night    Before the rising sun.  The busy tribes of flesh and blood,    With all their lives and cares, Are carried downwards by thy flood,    And lost in following years.  Time, like an ever-rolling stream,    Bears all its sons away; They fly forgotten, as a dream    Dies at the opening day.  Like flowery fields the nations stand,    Pleased with the morning light; The flowers beneath the mower’s hand    Lie withering e’er ’tis night.  Our God, our help in ages past,    Our hope for years to come, Be thou our guard while troubles last,    And our eternal home.

’T was merry Christmas when he came, Our little boy beneath the sod; And brighter burned the Christmas flame, And merrier sped the Christmas game, Because within the house there lay   A shape as tiny as a fay—       The Christmas gift of God! In wreaths and garlands on the walls   The holly hung its ruby balls,       The mistletoe its pearls; And a Christmas tree’s fantastic fruits   Woke laughter like a choir of flutes       From happy boys and girls. For the mirth, which else had swelled as shrill   As a school let loose to its errant will,       Was softened by the thought,   That in a dim hushed room above   A mother’s pains in a mother’s love       Were only just forgot. The jest, the tale, the toast, the glee, All took a sober tone; We spoke of the babe upstairs, as we   Held festival for him alone. When the bells rang in the Christmas morn,   It scarcely seemed a sin to say That they rang because that babe was born,   Not less than for the sacred day. Ah! Christ forgive us for the crime Which drowned the memories of the time         In a merely mortal bliss! We owned the error when the mirth Of another Christmas lit the hearth       Of every home but this. When, in that lonely burial-ground, With every Christmas sight and sound   Removed or shunned, we kept A mournful Christmas by the mound   Where little Willie slept!  Ah, hapless mother! darling wife!   I might say nothing more, And the dull cold world would hold   The story of that precious life       As amply told! Shall we, shall you and I, before   That world’s unsympathetic eyes   Lay other relics from our store       Of tender memories? What could it know of the joy and love   That throbbed and smiled and wept above       An unresponsive thing? And who could share the ecstatic thrill   With which we watched the upturned bill   Of our bird at its living spring?   Shall we tell how in the time gone by,   Beneath all changes of the sky,   And in an ordinary home       Amid the city’s din, Life was to us a crystal dome,         Our babe the flame therein?   Ah! this were jargon on the mart; And though some gentle friend, And many and many a suffering heart,   Would weep and comprehend,   Yet even these might fail to see   What we saw daily in the child— Not the mere creature undefiled,   But the winged cherub soon to be. That wandering hand which seemed to reach       At angel finger-tips, And that murmur like a mystic speech         Upon the rosy lips, That something in the serious face   Holier than even its infant grace,   And that rapt gaze on empty space,   Which made us, half believing, say,   “Ah, little wide-eyed seer! who knows   But that for you this chamber glows   With stately shapes and solemn shows?”   Which touched us, too, with vague alarms,   Lest in the circle of our arms   We held a being less akin To his parents in a world of sin   Than to beings not of clay: How could we speak in human phrase,   Of such scarce earthly traits and ways,         What would not seem       A doting dream, In the creed of these sordid days?         No! let us keep       Deep, deep, In sorrowing heart and aching brain,   This story hidden with the pain,   Which since that blue October night   When Willie vanished from our sight,   Must haunt us even in our sleep. In the gloom of the chamber where he died,   And by that grave which, through our care,   From Yule to Yule of every year,   Is made like spring to bloom; And where, at times, we catch the sigh As of an angel floating nigh, Who longs but has not power to tell That in that violet-shrouded cell Lies nothing better than the shell Which he had cast aside— By that sweet grave, in that dark room,   We may weave at will for each other’s ear, Of that life, and that love, and that early doom,   The tale which is shadowed here: To us alone it will always be As fresh as our own misery; But enough, alas! for the world is said, In the brief “Here lieth” of the dead!

Come and let us live my Deare,Let us love and never feare,What the sowrest Fathers say:Brightest Sol that dies to dayLives againe as blithe to morrow,But if we darke sons of sorrowSet; o then, how long a Night Shuts the Eyes of our short light!Then let amorous kisses dwellOn our lips, begin and tellA Thousand, and a Hundred, scoreAn Hundred, and a Thousand more,Till another Thousand smotherThat, and that wipe of another.Thus at last when we have numbredMany a Thousand, many a Hundred;Wee’l confound the reckoning quite,And lose our selves in wild delight:While our joyes so multiply,As shall mocke the envious eye.

We’re headed for empty-headedness,
the featureless amnesias of Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada,
states rich only in vowel sounds and alliteration.
We’re taking the train so we can see into the heart
of the heart of America framed in the windows’ cool
oblongs of light. We want cottages, farmhouses
with peaked roofs leashed by wood smoke to the clouds;
we want the golden broth of sunlight ladled over
ponds and meadows. We’ve never seen a meadow.
Now, we want to wade into one—up to our chins in the grassy
welter—the long reach of our vision grabbing up great
handfuls and armloads of scenery at the clouds’
white sale, at the bargain basement giveaway
of clods and scat and cow pies. We want to feel half
of America to the left of us and half to the right, ourselves
like a spine dividing the book in two, ourselves holding
the whole great story together. 
Then, suddenly, the train pulls into the station,
and the scenery begins to creep forward—the ramshackle shapes
of Main Street, a Chevy dozing at a ribbon of curb, and here is a hound
and a trolley, the street lights on their long stems, here is the little park
and the park stuff: bum on a bench, deciduous trees, a woman upholstered
in a red dress, the bus out of town sunk to its chromium bumper in shadows.
The noise of a train gathers momentum and disappears into the distance,
and there is a name strolling across the landscape in the crisply voluminous
script of the title page, as though it were a signature on the contract, as though
it were the author of this story.

Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird’s throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight,
Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child leaving his bed wander’d alone, bareheaded, barefoot,
Down from the shower’d halo,
Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive,
Out from the patches of briers and blackberries,
From the memories of the bird that chanted to me,
From your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and fallings I heard,
From under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as if with tears,
From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist,
From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,
From the myriad thence-arous’d words,
From the word stronger and more delicious than any,
From such as now they start the scene revisiting,
As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,
Borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,
A man, yet by these tears a little boy again,
Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,
I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,
Taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,
A reminiscence sing. 
Once Paumanok,
When the lilac-scent was in the air and Fifth-month grass was growing,
Up this seashore in some briers,
Two feather’d guests from Alabama, two together,
And their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown,
And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,
And every day the she-bird crouch’d on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,
And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them,
Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.  Shine! shine! shine!
Pour down your warmth, great sun!
While we bask, we two together. 
Two together!
Winds blow south, or winds blow north,
Day come white, or night come black,
Home, or rivers and mountains from home,
Singing all time, minding no time,
While we two keep together.

^^EOP^^

Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me,Whispering, I love you, before long I die,I have travell’d a long way merely to look on you to touch you,For I could not die till I once look’d on you,For I fear’d I might afterward lose you.

(variations on the testimony and excommunication of
Anne Hutchinson, Massachusetts Bay Colony, 1637-1638)



I. 
Given to sweet motion
the wilderness believes
one fair one of flowers
to be a moral blossom.
We go so far. Walks now,
only legend remaining. 
"I came afterwards to the window when you was writing." 
But in their documents
her judges had written
                                    "Insolent." 
In its branches
spirit shelters
air with wailing.
The air thunders
unavailingly there. 
"Fear is a snare. Why should I be afraid." 
                            If I was in error
                            but not mistaken,
                            if my glass was gone
                            but not broken
                                              (defaced) 
2. 
My path illuminates
all the interior of
a dusky mirror, the
left shoulder higher
than the right is in
memory's intricate. 
We must study distinctions aftertimes will adore.
if the glass be taken away, we shall see more. 
God is going. Walks now, only God remaining.  
                           (wanting)
an immediate promise He will deliver them
(wanting)         in a day of trouble 
These emotions she retained
in the universal heart, in
a new eye: rational charity
                              active piety
                              appearing as blindness appears
                              in the face in bright sunlight
                              exactly like a smile.  
3. 
"Here is a great stir about graces
and looking to hearts, but give me
Christ. Tell me not of meditations
and duties, but tell me of Christ."
Christ is one thing. The soul is another
the wild outskirt
of the earth will
prove the ruin of. 
And mischief, the poor babe, grew in the forest.
                                              (defaced) 
A stick a bunch of rags a flower
need no transformation. The hour
given to sweet motion is a soul. 
I came to the window when God was going.
In low condition,
little number and
remoteness things 
                           outbreaks of temper
                           had a kind of value
                           and even a comfort.  
4. 
A memory a promise or a flower sheared away
was not made
                     but taken from a bush of wild roses.
Seeing them, she began to cry out for a red rose. 
"God has left me to distinguish
between the voice of my Beloved
and John Baptist and Antichrist."
But daybreak unites what belongs together,
and there are two kinds of distinction.
There are (something wanting) 
"What he declares he does not know himself." 
I know a day of small
and a day of infancy.
At the window vividly
just now and entirely
inarticulate the form
given to sweet motion 
broke apart and
                         there's colors all
kinds all round. 
5. 
Of realities surrounding us,
their pith and substance was
                                           wasted
                                           wronged
                                           misplaced. 
"I desire to speak to our teacher." 
                                           In a state of desire,
                                           what belongs together
                                           ignores the barriers. 
Daybreak
have you
any word
your own
or I one
fair one
remaining? 
God is gone, only a window and a wilderness
remaining, not made but taken,
thinnest fantasy of beginnings 
taken from a bush of wild red roses.

Late in the season the world digs in, the fat blossoms
hold still for just a moment longer.   
Nothing looks satisfied,
but there is no real reason to move on much further:
this isn’t a bad place;   
why not pretend 
we wished for it?
The bushes have learned to live with their haunches.   
The hydrangea is resigned
to its pale and inconclusive utterances.
Towards the end of the season
it is not bad 
to have the body. To have experienced joy
as the mere lifting of hunger   
is not to have known it   
less. The tobacco leaves   
don’t mind being removed
to the long racks—all uses are astounding 
to the used.
There are moments in our lives which, threaded, give us heaven—
noon, for instance, or all the single victories
of gravity, or the kudzu vine,
most delicate of manias,
which has pressed its luck 
this far this season.
It shines a gloating green.
Its edges darken with impatience, a kind of wind.
Nothing again will ever be this easy, lives
being snatched up like dropped stitches, the dry stalks of daylilies   
marking a stillness we can’t keep.

I 
Oh chimes set high on the sunny tower   
    Ring on, ring on unendingly,
Make all the hours a single hour,   
For when the dusk begins to flower,   
    The man I love will come to me! ... 
But no, go slowly as you will,
    I should not bid you hasten so,   
For while I wait for love to come,   
Some other girl is standing dumb,
    Fearing her love will go.  
       II 
Oh white steam over the roofs, blow high!   
    Oh chimes in the tower ring clear and free!   
Oh sun awake in the covered sky,
    For the man I love, loves me! ... 
Oh drifting steam disperse and die,
    Oh tower stand shrouded toward the south,—
Fate heard afar my happy cry,
    And laid her finger on my mouth.  
       III 
The dusk was blue with blowing mist,   
    The lights were spangles in a veil,   
And from the clamor far below
    Floated faint music like a wail. 
It voiced what I shall never speak,
    My heart was breaking all night long,
But when the dawn was hard and gray,   
    My tears distilled into a song.  
       IV 
I said, “I have shut my heart   
    As one shuts an open door,
That Love may starve therein   
    And trouble me no more.” 
But over the roofs there came
    The wet new wind of May,
And a tune blew up from the curb
    Where the street-pianos play. 
My room was white with the sun   
    And Love cried out to me,
“I am strong, I will break your heart   
    Unless you set me free.”

Waiting for your ride in front of the house
where you spent the night,
where, as a third ear
during their endless intimate,
important, and kinky phone calls,
you pretended to rinse glassware;
you were a dog from the pound,
grateful, sniffing the upholstery. 
Later, lying in the center of their
king-sized bed, a giant wall-to-wall
mirror, isolating you like a rabbit;
it was also their exercise
room with torture equipment;
something in you twitched;
flickering a bizarre video in your head. 
It’s morning now. You’re standing
outside, with nightgown and toothbrush
wrapped in your purse, waiting for a bus
to take you somewhere else. You’re depressed.
They’re asleep of course. Their network wrapped
around them. You keep wondering why you’re
missing something. Then you look back and see
your pricked-up ears, your waggy self, stuck
inside their picture window, where for years
it will wave at you—naive, apologetic, embarrassed.

non peccat, quaecumque potest peccasse negare, 
solaque famosam culpa professa facit.

Amores, III, xiv 



I love my work and my children. God   
Is distant, difficult. Things happen.   
Too near the ancient troughs of blood   
Innocence is no earthly weapon. 
I have learned one thing: not to look down
So much upon the damned. They, in their sphere,   
Harmonize strangely with the divine
Love. I, in mine, celebrate the love-choir.

Twice through my bedroom window
I’ve seen the horned owl drop from the oaks to panic   
the rabbit in my neighbor’s backyard.
Last night he paced for an hour across the top   
of the cage, scrutinizing
the can of water, the mound of pellets,
turning his genius to the riddle
of the wire, while under him
the rabbit balled like a fat carnation in the wind. 
Both of the terriers yapped from their porch   
but the owl never flinched, pacing,
clawing the wire, spreading wings like a gray cape,   
leaping, straining to lift the whole cage,
and the cage rocking
on its stilts, settling, and rocking again,
until he settled with it, paused,
and returned to a thought. 
And the rabbit, ignorant of mercy,   
curled on itself in that white drift   
of feathers? 
Wait, three years and I haven’t escaped the child   
I saw at Northside the night   
my daughter was born, 
a little brown sack of twigs
curled under glass, eyes bulging,
trembling in the monitors,
and the nurses
rolling the newborns out to nurse,
and the shadows sweeping the nursery.

I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is OzymandiasOzymandias Pharaoh Rameses II (reigned 1279-1213 BCE). According to the OED, the statue was once 57 feet tall., King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

It was a green barn coat from L. L. Bean
That he had ordered, thinking of her
Walking the snowy hillside of his dream
Though she detested the style and color. 
That it arrived two days after he died
Did not dispose her to detest it less
Though she may have wished she did,
The way she wished she’d kept house 
More neatly or baked instead of fried,
For every coronary’s a latent homicide—
If not what we did, what we did not do.
If not what we said, what we did not say. 
In this, the inner jury’s always out,
No different for man or woman—
For everyone over forty, the human
Condition is grief complicated by guilt. 
It’s unexceptional really, what’s left
After deaths. We’re thrown back on our own taste.
That coat, for instance. If that was a gift,
She would have to hide to throw it away.

Sitting between the sea and the buildings
He enjoyed painting the sea’s portrait.
But just as children imagine a prayer
Is merely silence, he expected his subject
To rush up the sand, and, seizing a brush,
Plaster its own portrait on the canvas. 
So there was never any paint on his canvas
Until the people who lived in the buildings
Put him to work: “Try using the brush
As a means to an end. Select, for a portrait,
Something less angry and large, and more subject
To a painter’s moods, or, perhaps, to a prayer.” 
How could he explain to them his prayer
That nature, not art, might usurp the canvas?
He chose his wife for a new subject,
Making her vast, like ruined buildings,
As if, forgetting itself, the portrait
Had expressed itself without a brush. 
Slightly encouraged, he dipped his brush
In the sea, murmuring a heartfelt prayer:
“My soul, when I paint this next portrait
Let it be you who wrecks the canvas.”
The news spread like wildfire through the buildings:
He had gone back to the sea for his subject. 
Imagine a painter crucified by his subject!
Too exhausted even to lift his brush,
He provoked some artists leaning from the buildings
To malicious mirth: “We haven’t a prayer
Now, of putting ourselves on canvas,
Or getting the sea to sit for a portrait!” 
Others declared it a self-portrait.
Finally all indications of a subject
Began to fade, leaving the canvas
Perfectly white. He put down the brush.
At once a howl, that was also a prayer,
Arose from the overcrowded buildings. 
They tossed him, the portrait, from the tallest of the buildings;
And the sea devoured the canvas and the brush
As though his subject had decided to remain a prayer.

It wasn’t working. Didn’t look back. Needed something else. So
I went out. After lunch I saw it in a different light, like a thing
emerging from behind a fever bush, something reaching the
senses with the smell of seaweed boiling, and as visible as yellow
snowdrops on black earth. Tasted it too, on the tongue Jamaica
pepper. To the touch, a velvet flower. Dragging and scumming, I
gave myself to it stroke after stroke. It kept coming in bits and fits,
fragments and snags. I even heard it singing but in the wrong key
like a deranged bird in wild cherries, having the time of its life.

Who, who had only seen wings,
could extrapolate the
skinny sticks of things
birds use for land,
the backward way they bend,
the silly way they stand?
And who, only studying
birdtracks in the sand,
could think those little forks
had decamped on the wind?
So many paired things seem odd.
Who ever would have dreamed
the broad winged raven of despair
would quit the air and go
bandylegged upon the ground,
a common crow?

The cheese-mites asked how the cheese got there,
  And warmly debated the matter;The Orthodox said that it came from the air,
  And the Heretics said from the platter.They argued it long and they argued it strong,

  Not one of them thought of a cow.

The Greeks are sitting on the beach
wondering what to do when the war ends. No one
wants to go home, back
to that bony island; everyone wants a little more
of what there is in Troy, more
life on the edge, that sense of every day as being
packed with surprises. But how to explain this
to the ones at home to whom
fighting a war is a plausible
excuse for absence, whereas
exploring one’s capacity for diversion
is not. Well, this can be faced
later; these
are men of action, ready to leave
insight to the women and children.
Thinking things over in the hot sun, pleased
by a new strength in their forearms, which seem
more golden than they did at home, some
begin to miss their families a little,
to miss their wives, to want to see
if the war has aged them. And a few grow
slightly uneasy: what if war
is just a male version of dressing up,
a game devised to avoid
profound spiritual questions? Ah,
but it wasn’t only the war. The world had begun
calling them, an opera beginning with the war’s
loud chords and ending with the floating aria of the sirens.
There on the beach, discussing the various
timetables for getting home, no one believed
it could take ten years to get back to Ithaca;
no one foresaw that decade of insoluble dilemmas—oh unanswerable
affliction of the human heart: how to divide
the world’s beauty into acceptable
and unacceptable loves! On the shores of Troy,
how could the Greeks know
they were hostages already: who once
delays the journey is
already enthralled; how could they know
that of their small number
some would be held forever by the dreams of pleasure,
some by sleep, some by music?

On a small lake off
the map of the world, two
swans lived. As swans,
they spent eighty percent of the day studying
themselves in the attentive water and
twenty percent ministering to the beloved
other. Thus
their fame as lovers stems
chiefly from narcissism, which leaves
so little leisure for
more general cruising. But
fate had other plans: after ten years, they hit
slimy water; whatever the filth was, it
clung to the male’s plumage, which turned
instantly gray; simultaneously,
the true purpose of his neck’s
flexible design revealed itself. So much
action on the flat lake, so much
he’s missed! Sooner or later in a long
life together, every couple encounters
some emergency like this, some
drama which results
in harm. This
occurs for a reason: to test
love and to demand
fresh articulation of its complex terms.
So it came to light that the male and female
flew under different banners: whereas
the male believed that love
was what one felt in one’s heart
the female believed
love was what one did. But this is not
a little story about the male’s
inherent corruption, using as evidence the swan’s
sleazy definition of purity. It is
a story of guile and innocence. For ten years
the female studied the male; she dallied
when he slept or when he was
conveniently absorbed in the water,
while the spontaneous male
acted casually, on
the whim of the moment. On the muddy water
they bickered awhile, in the fading light,
until the bickering grew
slowly abstract, becoming
part of their song
after a little longer.

Local his discourse, not yet exemplary,
Nowadays he is old, the translator,
So old he is practically transparent. 
Good things and otherwise, evils done
Come home to him, too close to the bone
And so little transformed,
Him so transparent,
They float in and out of his window. 
Killing fields and the pumpkin patch,
The combat boot putrid in a cherry tree,
Stroke on stroke the mortal build-up,
All the constraint, all the letting go, 
So insistent in his attentions
That he needs a breathing block.
For lack of a monitor he might levitate,
The testy old bird, at his wondow;
He needs an animal, a sure thing,
One to imagine, at last. Speechless
As bedrock, a rough reminder of that. 
A dog might be vigilant enough,
Intact, all heart, a yellow desert dog. Avoirdupoids. A leopard? Markings
Regular, talons to swat
Any hurt away. Knowing
Hunger, not the greed. Sufficient 
Unto itself, svelte, clean of limb;
Free through self-discipline, yes,
Yes, through self-discipline free, 
And fierce, yet doing no violence
The wild by right he will restore
To a holy place, in time. 
For want of that sort of a beast,
He might make do with a frog.

This poem is concerned with language on a very plain level.
Look at it talking to you. You look out a window
Or pretend to fidget. You have it but you don’t have it.
You miss it, it misses you. You miss each other. 
The poem is sad because it wants to be yours, and cannot.
What’s a plain level? It is that and other things,
Bringing a system of them into play. Play?
Well, actually, yes, but I consider play to be 
A deeper outside thing, a dreamed role-pattern,
As in the division of grace these long August days
Without proof. Open-ended. And before you know know / It The line began and ended with the same word when first published in the Times Literary Supplement (October 24, 1980):   know it / It 
It gets lost in the steam and chatter of typewriters. 
It has been played once more. I think you exist only
To tease me into doing it, on your level, and then you aren’t there
Or have adopted a different attitude. And the poem
Has set me softly down beside you. The poem is you.

hunched over the greasy
burner on the stove
was noir, as in  film noir, as in cauchemar,
as in le nuit 
not blanche but noir, the dream you can’t
wake up from, meaning she 
was a mouse fatale,
licking the old oil
glued to the old 
cooktop, feasting
in her tiny hunched-up
sewer life 
on fats & proteins for her bébés all atremble in their
rotting poubel nest, 
so when I screamed my piercing
Anglo-Imperial scream of
horror & betrayal— 
not my stove, not my traces of pot au feu—
she leaped, balletic, over 
the sink, the fridge, the lave-vaiselle,
& back to the cave & the trash she
scuttled, grim as a witch 
in La Fontaine
who has to learn
the lesson we 
all must learn: Reality is always sterner  than pleasures of the nighttime burner.


^^EOP^^

While spoon-feeding him with one hand   
she holds his hand with her other hand,   
or rather lets it rest on top of his,
which is permanently clenched shut.   
When he turns his head away, she reaches   
around and puts in the spoonful blind.   
He will not accept the next morsel
until he has completely chewed this one.   
His bright squint tells her he finds
the shrimp she has just put in delicious.
Next to the voice and touch of those we love,   
food may be our last pleasure on earth—
a man on death row takes his T-bone   
in small bites and swishes each sip
of the jug wine around in his mouth,   
tomorrow will be too late for them to jolt   
this supper out of him. She strokes
his head very slowly, as if to cheer up
each separate discomfited hair sticking up   
from its root in his stricken brain.
Standing behind him, she presses
her cheek to his, kisses his jowl,
and his eyes seem to stop seeing
and do nothing but emit light.
Could heaven be a time, after we are dead,   
of remembering the knowledge
flesh had from flesh? The flesh
of his face is hard, perhaps
from years spent facing down others
until they fell back, and harder
from years of being himself faced down
and falling back in his turn, and harder still   
from all the while frowning
and beaming and worrying and shouting   
and probably letting go in rages.   
His face softens into a kind
of quizzical wince, as if one
of the other animals were working at   
getting the knack of the human smile.   
When picking up a cookie he uses   
both thumbtips to grip it
and push it against an index finger   
to secure it so that he can lift it.
She takes him then to the bathroom,   
where she lowers his pants and removes
the wet diaper and holds the spout of the bottle
to his old penis until he pisses all he can,
then puts on the fresh diaper and pulls up his pants.   
When they come out, she is facing him,   
walking backwards in front of him   
and holding his hands, pulling him   
when he stops, reminding him to step   
when he forgets and starts to pitch forward.   
She is leading her old father into the future   
as far as they can go, and she is walking   
him back into her childhood, where she stood   
in bare feet on the toes of his shoes   
and they foxtrotted on this same rug.
I watch them closely: she could be teaching him   
the last steps that one day she may teach me.
At this moment, he glints and shines,
as if it will be only a small dislocation
for him to pass from this paradise into the next.

1. The Cane Fields 
There is a parrot imitating spring
in the palace, its feathers parsley green.   
Out of the swamp the cane appears 
to haunt us, and we cut it down. El General   
searches for a word; he is all the world   
there is. Like a parrot imitating spring, 
we lie down screaming as rain punches through   
and we come up green. We cannot speak an R—
out of the swamp, the cane appears 
and then the mountain we call in whispers Katalina.
The children gnaw their teeth to arrowheads.   
There is a parrot imitating spring. 
El General has found his word: perejil.
Who says it, lives. He laughs, teeth shining   
out of the swamp. The cane appears 
in our dreams, lashed by wind and streaming.   
And we lie down. For every drop of blood   
there is a parrot imitating spring.
Out of the swamp the cane appears.   2. The Palace 
The word the general’s chosen is parsley.   
It is fall, when thoughts turn
to love and death; the general thinks
of his mother, how she died in the fall
and he planted her walking cane at the grave   
and it flowered, each spring stolidly forming   
four-star blossoms. The general 
pulls on his boots, he stomps to
her room in the palace, the one without   
curtains, the one with a parrot
in a brass ring. As he paces he wonders   
Who can I kill today. And for a moment   
the little knot of screams
is still. The parrot, who has traveled 
all the way from Australia in an ivory   
cage, is, coy as a widow, practising   
spring. Ever since the morning   
his mother collapsed in the kitchen   
while baking skull-shaped candies   
for the Day of the Dead, the general   
has hated sweets. He orders pastries   
brought up for the bird; they arrive 
dusted with sugar on a bed of lace.   
The knot in his throat starts to twitch;   
he sees his boots the first day in battle   
splashed with mud and urine
as a soldier falls at his feet amazed—
how stupid he looked!— at the sound
of artillery. I never thought it would sing   
the soldier said, and died. Now 
the general sees the fields of sugar   
cane, lashed by rain and streaming.   
He sees his mother’s smile, the teeth   
gnawed to arrowheads. He hears   
the Haitians sing without R’s
as they swing the great machetes:    Katalina, they sing, Katalina,  mi madle, mi amol en muelte. God knows   
his mother was no stupid woman; she   
could roll an R like a queen. Even   
a parrot can roll an R! In the bare room   
the bright feathers arch in a parody   
of greenery, as the last pale crumbs
disappear under the blackened tongue. Someone 
calls out his name in a voice
so like his mother’s, a startled tear
splashes the tip of his right boot. My mother, my love in death. 
The general remembers the tiny green sprigs   
men of his village wore in their capes   
to honor the birth of a son. He will
order many, this time, to be killed 
for a single, beautiful word.

When others run to windows or out of doors
To catch the sunset whole, he is content
With any segment anywhere he sits. 
From segment, fragment, he can reconstruct
The whole, prefers to reconstruct the whole,
As if to say, I see more seeing less. 
A window to the east will serve as well
As window to the west, for eastern sky
Echoes the western sky. And even less— 
A patch of light that picture-glass happens
To catch from window-glass, fragment of fragment,
Flawed, distorted, dulled, nevertheless 
Gives something unglassed nature cannot give:
The old obliquity of art, and proves
Part may be more than whole, least may be best.

Not knowing in what season this again
Not knowing when again the arms outyearning
Nor the flung smile in eyes not knowing when 
Not sure beyond all doubt of full return
Not sure of time now nor the film’s reversal
This all done opposite, the waif regathered 
Like our lost parents in the blinded song
We bag in hand with wandering steps and slow
Through suburbs take our solitary way 
Not that all clouds are garrisoned and stung
Not that horizons loom with coppered legions
Not that the year is dark with weird condition 
All who parted in all days looked back
Saw the white face, the waving. And saw the sea
Not knowing in what season this again 
For well they knew, the parters in all evenings
Druid and Roman and the rocked Phoenician:
The blood flows one imposed way, and no other


^^EOP^^

Lilacs look neon in fading light.
Death makes life shine:
a tiredness, a flickering between 
ages, which is each age;
a piling up to tottering
and falling back to sand. 
So much for cycle. The front door lock
sticks each fall when we’re first back.
We are advised to oil it. 
Olive oil in the keyhole:
again the old key turns.
Once again to meander 
along the edge of water,
whether tideless sea or tidal river,
pushing the stroller, dreaming  oil in the lock; the key
dipped in lubricity
the boychild’s shining skin
me tired to the bone

The deep diving bibles and legends,         
The daring plots of the poets, the elder religions;            
O you temples fairer than lilies, pour’d over by the rising sun!            
O you fables, spurning the known, eluding the hold of the known, mounting to heaven!            
You lofty and dazzling towers, pinnacledpinnacled a small, ornamental turret on top of a building or tower, usually resembling a pyramid or cone., red as roses, burnish’d with gold!

You engineers, you architects, machinists, yours,            
You, not for trade or transportation only,
But in God’s name, and for thy sake, O soul.

I. Until Jove let it be, no colonist
Mastered the wild earth; no land was marked,   
None parceled out or shared; but everyone   
Looked for his living in the common world. 
And Jove gave poison to the blacksnakes, and   
Made the wolves ravage, made the ocean roll,   
Knocked honey from the leaves, took fire away—   
So man might beat out various inventions   
By reasoning and art.
                                 First he chipped fire
Out of the veins of flint where it was hidden;   
Then rivers felt his skiffs of the light alder;
Then sailors counted up the stars and named them:   
Pleiades, Hyades, and the Pole Star;
Then were discovered ways to take wild things.   
In snares, or hunt them with the circling pack;   
And how to whip a stream with casting nets,   
Or draw the deep-sea fisherman’s cordage up;   
And then the use of steel and the shrieking saw;   
Then various crafts. All things were overcome   
By labor and by force of bitter need.  II. Even when your threshing floor is leveled   
By the big roller, smoothed and packed by hand   
With potter’s clay, so that it will not crack,   
There are still nuisances. The tiny mouse   
Locates his house and granary underground,
Or the blind mole tunnels his dark chamber;   
The toad, too, and all monsters of the earth,   
Besides those plunderers of the grain, the weevil   
And frantic ant, scared of a poor old age. 
Let me speak then, too, of the farmer’s weapons:   
The heavy oaken plow and the plowshare,   
The slowly rolling carts of Demeter,   
The threshing machine, the sledge, the weighted mattock,
The withe baskets, the cheap furniture,
The harrow and the magic winnowing fan—
All that your foresight makes provision of,   
If you still favor the divine countryside.  III. Moreover, like men tempted by the straits
In ships borne homeward through the blowing sea,   
We too must reckon on Arcturus star,
The days of luminous Draco and the Kids.
When Libra makes the hours of sleep and daylight   
Equal, dividing the world, half light, half dark,   
Then drive the team, and sow the field with barley,   
Even under intractable winter’s rain.
But Spring is the time to sow your beans and clover,   
When shining Taurus opens the year with his golden   
Horns, and the Dog’s averted star declines;   
For greater harvests of your wheat and spelt,   
Let first the Pleiades and Hyades be hid
And Ariadne’s diadem go down.
The golden sun rules the great firmament
Through the twelve constellations, and the world   
Is measured out in certain parts, and heaven   
By five great zones is taken up entire:   
One glowing with sundazzle and fierce heat;   
And far away on either side the arctics,   
Frozen with ice and rain, cerulean;
And, in between, two zones for sick mankind:   
Through each of these a slanting path is cut   
Where pass in line the zodiacal stars. 
Northward the steep world rises to Scythia   
And south of Libya descends, where black   
Styx and the lowest of the dead look on.
In the north sky the Snake glides like a river   
Winding about the Great and Little Bear—   
Those stars that fear forever the touch of ocean;   
Southward they say profound Night, mother of Furies,   
Sits tight-lipped among the crowding shades,   
Or thence Aurora draws the daylight back;   
And where the East exhales the yellow morning,   
Reddening evening lights her stars at last.   IV. As for the winter, when the freezing rains   
Confine the farmer, he may employ himself   
In preparations for serener seasons.
The plowman beats the plowshare on the forge,   
Or makes his vats of tree-trunks hollowed out,   
Brands his cattle, numbers his piles of grain,   
Sharpens fence posts or pitchforks, prepares   
Umbrian trellises for the slow vine.
Then you may weave the baskets of bramble twigs   
Or dip your bleating flock in the clean stream.   
Often the farmer loads his little mule
With olive oil or apples, and brings home
A grindstone or a block of pitch from market. 
And some will stay up late beside the fire   
On winter nights, whittling torches, while
The housewife runs the shuttle through the loom   
And comforts the long labor with her singing;   
Or at the stove she simmers the new wine,   
Skimming the froth with leaves. Oh idle time!   
In that hale season, all their worries past,
Farmers arrange convivialities—
As after laden ships have reached home port,
The happy sailors load the prow with garlands.   
Then is the time to gather acorns and
Laurel berries and the bloodred myrtle,
To lay your traps for cranes and snares for buck,   
To hit the fallow deer with twisted slingshots,   
And track the long-eared hare—
When snow is deep, and ice is on the rivers.   V. What of the humors and the ways of Autumn? 
Just when the farmer wished to reap his yellow
Fields, and thresh his grain,
I have often seen all the winds make war,
Flattening the stout crops from the very roots;
And in the black whirlwind
Carrying off the ears and the light straw.
And often mighty phalanxes of rain
Marched out of heaven, as the clouds
Rolled up from the sea the detestable tempest;   
Then the steep aether thundered, and the deluge   
Soaked the crops, filled ditches, made the rivers   
Rise and roar and seethe in their spuming beds. 
The Father himself in the mid stormy night   
Lets the lightning go, at whose downstroke   
Enormous earth quivers, wild things flee,
And fear abases the prone hearts of men—   
As Jove splits Athos with his firebolt
Or Rhodopê or the Ceraunian ridge.
The southwind wails in sheets of rain,
And under that great wind the groves
Lament, and the long breast of the shore is shaken. 
If you dislike to be so caught, mark well
The moon’s phases and the weather signs;
Notice where Saturn’s frigid star retires,
Mercury’s wanderings over heaven; and revere   
Especially, the gods. Offer to Ceres
Annual sacrifice and annual worship
In the first fair weather of the spring,
So may your sheep grow fat and your vines fruitful,   
Your sleep sweet and your mountains full of shade.   
Let all the country folk come to adore her,   
And offer her libations of milk and wine;
Conduct the sacrificial lamb three times
Around the ripe field, in processional,
With all your chorus singing out to Ceres;   
And let no man lay scythe against his grain   
Unless he first bind oakleaves on his head   
And make his little dance, and sing to her.   VI. When shall we herd the cattle to the stables? 
The wind, say, rises without intermission;   
The sea gets choppy and the swell increases;   
The dry crash of boughs is heard on hills;   
The long sound of the surf becomes a tumult;   
The gusts become more frequent in the grove;   
The waves begin to fight against the keels;   
From far at sea the gulls fly shoreward crying;   
The heron leaves his favorite marsh and soars   
Over the high cloud. Then you will see   
Beyond thin skimrack, shooting stars
Falling, the long pale tracks behind them   
Whitening through the darkness of the night;   
And you’ll see straw and fallen leaves blowing.   
But when it thunders in rough Boreas’ quarter,   
When east and west it thunders—every sailor   
Furls his dripping sail. 
A storm should never catch you unprepared.   
Aerial cranes take flight before its rising,   
The restless heifer with dilated nostrils   
Sniffs the air; the squeaking hirondelle   
Flits round and round the lake, and frogs,
Inveterate in their mud, croak a chorale.   
And too the ant, more frantic in his gallery,   
Trundles his eggs out from their hiding place;   
The rainbow, cloud imbiber, may be seen;   
And crows go cawing from the pasture   
In a harsh throng of crepitating wings;   
The jeering jay gives out his yell for rain   
And takes a walk by himself on the dry sand.   
Stormwise, the various sea-fowl, and such birds   
As grub the sweet Swan River in Asia,
May be observed dousing themselves and diving
Or riding on the water, as if they wished—   
What odd exhilaration—to bathe themselves.  VII. After a storm, clear weather and continuing   
Sunny days may likewise be foretold:
By the sharp twinkle of the stars, the moon   
Rising to face her brother’s rays by day;   
No tenuous fleeces blowing in the sky,   
No halcyons, sea favorites, on the shore   
Stretching out their wings in tepid sunlight;   
But mists go lower and lie on the fields,
The owl, observing sundown from his perch,   
Modulates his meaningless melancholy.   
Aloft in crystal air the sparrow hawk   
Chases his prey; and as she flits aside
The fierce hawk follows screaming on the wind,   
And as he swoops, she flits aside again.   
With funereal contractions of the windpipe   
The crows produce their caws, three at a time,
And in their high nests, pleased at I know not what,   
Noise it among themselves: no doubt rejoicing   
To see their little brood after the storm,
But not, I think, by reason of divine
Insight or superior grasp of things.   VIII. But if you carefully watch the rapid sun   
And the moon following, a fair night’s snare   
Never deceives you as to next day’s weather.   
When the new moon collects a rim of light,   
If that bow be obscured with a dark vapor,   
Then a great tempest is in preparation;   
If it be blushing like a virgin’s cheek,   
There will be wind; wind makes Diana blush;   
If on the fourth night (most significant)   
She goes pure and unclouded through the sky,   
All that day and the following days will be,
For one full month, exempt from rain and wind.   
The sun, too, rising and setting in the waves,   
Will give you weather signs, trustworthy ones   
Whether at morning or when stars come out.   
A mackerel sky over the east at sunrise   
Means look out for squalls, a gale is coming,   
Unfavorable to trees and plants and flocks.   
Or when through denser strata the sun’s rays   
Break out dimly, or Aurora rises
Pale from Tithonus’ crocus-colored chamber,   
Alas, the vine-leaf will not shield the cluster   
In the hubbub of roof-pattering bitter hail.
It will be well to notice sunset, too,
For the sun’s visage then has various colors;   
Bluish and dark means rain; if it be fiery   
That means an East wind; if it be dappled
And mixed with red gold light, then you will see   
Wind and rain in commotion everywhere.   
Nobody can advise me, on that night,   
To cast off hawsers and put out to sea.   
But if the next day passes and the sunset   
Then be clear, you need not fear the weather:   
A bright Norther will sway the forest trees.   IX. Last, what the late dusk brings, and whence the fair
Clouds are blown, and secrets of the Southwind   
You may learn from the sun, whose prophecies   
No man denies, seeing black insurrections,   
Treacheries, and wars are told by him. 
When Caesar died, the great sun pitied Rome,   
So veiling his bright head, the godless time   
Trembled in fear of everlasting night;
And then were portents given of earth and ocean,   
Vile dogs upon the roads, and hideous   
Strange birds, and Aetna quaking, and her fires   
Bursting to overflow the Cyclops’ fields
With flames whirled in the air and melted stones.   
Thunder of war was heard in Germany   
From south to north, shaking the granite Alps;   
And a voice also through the silent groves
Piercing; and apparitions wondrous pale   
Were seen in dead of night. Then cattle spoke
(O horror!), streams stood still, the earth cracked open   
And tears sprang even from the temple bronze.   
The Po, monarch of rivers, on his back   
Spuming whole forests, raced through the lowland plains
And bore off pens and herds; and then continually   
The viscera of beasts were thick with evil,
Blood trickled from the springs; tall towns at night   
Re-echoed to the wolf-pack’s shivering howl;   
And never from pure heaven have there fallen   
So many fires, nor baleful comets burned.   
It seemed that once again the Roman lines,   
Alike in arms, would fight at Philippi;
And heaven permitted those Thessalian fields   
To be enriched again with blood of ours.   
Some future day, perhaps, in that country,   
A farmer with his plow will turn the ground,   
And find the javelins eaten thin with rust,   
Or knock the empty helmets with his mattock   
And wonder, digging up those ancient bones. 
Paternal gods! Ancestors! Mother Vesta!   
You that guard Tiber and the Palatine!   
Now that long century is overthrown,
Let not this young man fail to give us peace!   
Long enough beneath your rule, O Caesar,   
Heaven has hated us and all those triumphs   
Where justice was thrown down—so many wars,   
So many kinds of wickedness! No honor
Rendered the plow, but the fields gone to ruin,   
The country-folk made homeless, and their scythes   
Beaten to straight swords on the blowing forge!   
War from the Euphrates to Germany;
Ruptured engagements, violence of nations,
And impious Mars raging the whole world over—
As when a four horsed chariot rears away   
Plunging from the barrier, and runs wild,   
Heedless of the reins or the charioteer.

—on my seventy-ninth birthday



Nobody in the widow’s household   
ever celebrated anniversaries.   
In the secrecy of my room
I would not admit I cared
that my friends were given parties.   
Before I left town for school
my birthday went up in smoke   
in a fire at City Hall that gutted   
the Department of Vital Statistics.   
If it weren’t for a census report   
of a five-year-old White Male   
sharing my mother’s address
at the Green Street tenement in Worcester   
I’d have no documentary proof   
that I exist. You are the first,   
my dear, to bully me
into these festive occasions. 
Sometimes, you say, I wear
an abstracted look that drives you   
up the wall, as though it signified   
distress or disaffection.
Don’t take it so to heart.
Maybe I enjoy not-being as much   
as being who I am. Maybe
it’s time for me to practice
growing old. The way I look
at it, I’m passing through a phase:   
gradually I’m changing to a word.   
Whatever you choose to claim   
of me is always yours;
nothing is truly mine
except my name. I only
borrowed this dust.

I’m eating a little supper by the bright window.
The room’s already dark, the sky’s starting to turn.
Outside my door, the quiet roads lead,
after a short walk, to open fields.
I’m eating, watching the sky—who knows
how many women are eating now. My body is calm:
labor dulls all the senses, and dulls women too. 
Outside, after supper, the stars will come out to touch
the wide plain of the earth. The stars are alive,
but not worth these cherries, which I’m eating alone.
I look at the sky, know that lights already are shining
among rust-red roofs, noises of people beneath them.
A gulp of my drink, and my body can taste the life
of plants and of rivers. It feels detached from things.
A small dose of silence suffices, and everything’s still,
in its true place, just like my body is still. 
All things become islands before my senses,
which accept them as a matter of course: a murmur of silence.
All things in this darkness—I can know all of them,
just as I know that blood flows in my veins.
The plain is a great flowing of water through plants,
a supper of all things. Each plant, and each stone,
lives motionlessly. I hear my food feeding my veins
with each living thing that this plain provides. 
The night doesn’t matter. The square patch of sky
whispers all the loud noises to me, and a small star
struggles in emptiness, far from all foods,
from all houses, alien. It isn’t enough for itself,
it needs too many companions. Here in the dark, alone,
my body is calm, it feels it’s in charge.

[Supposed to be written by one at the point of death]



Give me my scallop shell of quiet, My staff of faith to walk upon, My scrip of joy, immortal diet, My bottle of salvation, My gown of glory, hope’s true gage, And thus I’ll take my pilgrimage.     Blood must be my body’s balmer, No other balm will there be given, Whilst my soul, like a white palmer, Travels to the land of heaven; Over the silver mountains, Where spring the nectar fountains; And there I’ll kiss The bowl of bliss, And drink my eternal fill On every milken hill. My soul will be a-dry before, But after it will ne’er thirst more; And by the happy blissful way More peaceful pilgrims I shall see, That have shook off their gowns of clay, And go apparelled fresh like me. I’ll bring them first To slake their thirst, And then to taste those nectar suckets, At the clear wells Where sweetness dwells, Drawn up by saints in crystal buckets.     And when our bottles and all we Are fill’d with immortality, Then the holy paths we’ll travel, Strew’d with rubies thick as gravel, Ceilings of diamonds, sapphire floors, High walls of coral, and pearl bowers.     From thence to heaven’s bribeless hall Where no corrupted voices brawl, No conscience molten into gold, Nor forg’d accusers bought and sold, No cause deferr’d, nor vain-spent journey, For there Christ is the king’s attorney, Who pleads for all without degrees, And he hath angels, but no fees. When the grand twelve million jury Of our sins and sinful fury, ’Gainst our souls black verdicts give, Christ pleads his death, and then we live. Be thou my speaker, taintless pleader, Unblotted lawyer, true proceeder, Thou movest salvation even for alms, Not with a bribed lawyer’s palms. And this is my eternal plea To him that made heaven, earth, and sea, Seeing my flesh must die so soon, And want a head to dine next noon, Just at the stroke when my veins start and spread, Set on my soul an everlasting head. Then am I ready, like a palmer fit, To tread those blest paths which before I writ.

To-day’s most trivial act may hold the seed
 Of future fruitfulness, or future dearth; Oh, cherish always every word and deed!
 The simplest record of thyself hath worth.
If thou hast ever slighted one old thought,
 Beware lest Grief enforce the truth at last; The time must come wherein thou shalt be taught
 The value and the beauty of the Past.
Not merely as a warner and a guide,
 “A voice behind thee,” sounding to the strife; But something never to be put aside,
 A part and parcel of thy present life.
Not as a distant and a darkened sky,
 Through which the stars peep, and the moonbeams glow;But a surrounding atmosphere, whereby
 We live and breathe, sustained in pain and woe.
A shadowy land, where joy and sorrow kiss, 
 Each still to each corrective and relief,Where dim delights are brightened into bliss, 
 And nothing wholly perishes but Grief.
Ah, me!—not dies—no more than spirit dies; 
 But in a change like death is clothed with wings; A serious angel, with entranced eyes,
 Looking to far-off and celestial things.

Pastime with good company I love and shall unto I die. Grudge whoso will, but none deny, So God be pleased, this live will I. For my pastance Hunt, sing, and dance. My heart is set All godely sport To my comfort. Who shall me let?  Youth will have needs daliance, Of good or ill some pastance. Company me thinketh then best All thoftes and fantasies to digest. For idleness Is chief mistress Of vices all. Than who can say But “pass the day” Is best of all?  Company with honesty Is virtue, and vice to flee. Company is good or ill But every man hath his free will. The best ensue, The worst eschew, My mind shall be. Virtue to use, Vice to refuse, I shall use me.

wolves of music weave their way at a run
hawthorns wheeze with clandestine laughter 
turning a new leaf, tide's out
young ship-captains high up on balconies
look far away through telescopes

beneath a tree grown from the pit I once spit out
I've hung nets to

Remember when you love, from that same hour Your peace you put into your lover’s power; From that same hour from him you laws receive, And as he shall ordain, you joy, or grieve, Hope, fear, laugh, weep; Reason aloof does stand, Disabled both to act, and to command. Oh cruel fetters! rather wish to feel On your soft limbs, the galling weight of steel; Rather to bloody wounds oppose your breast. No ill, by which the body can be pressed You will so sensible a torment find As shackles on your captived mind. The mind from heaven its high descent did draw, And brooks uneasily any other law Than what from Reason dictated shall be. Reason, a kind of innate deity, Which only can adapt to ev’ry soul A yoke so fit and light, that the control All liberty excels; so sweet a sway, The same ’tis to be happy, and obey; Commands so wise, and with rewards so dressed, That the according soul replies “I’m blessed.”

Patience, though I have not    The thing that I require, I must of force, God wot,    Forbear my most desire; For no ways can I find   To sail against the wind.  Patience, do what they will    To work me woe or spite, I shall content me still    To think both day and night, To think and hold my peace, Since there is no redress.  Patience, withouten blame,    For I offended nought; I know they know the same,    Though they have changed their thought. Was ever thought so moved To hate that it hath loved?  Patience of all my harm,    For fortune is my foe; Patience must be the charm    To heal me of my woe: Patience without offence Is a painful patience.

Now, God be thanked who has matched us with his hour,       And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping! With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,       To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping, Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary;       Leave the sick hearts that honor could not move, And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,       And all the little emptiness of love! Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,       Where there’s no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,             Naught broken save this body, lost but breath; Nothing to shake the laughing heart’s long peace there,       But only agony, and that has ending;             And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.

My Soul, there is a country
    Afar beyond the stars,Where stands a winged sentry
    All skillful in the wars;There, above noise and danger
    Sweet Peace sits, crown’d with smiles,And One born in a manger
    Commands the beauteous files.He is thy gracious friend
    And (O my Soul awake!)Did in pure love descend,
    To die here for thy sake.If thou canst get but thither,
    There grows the flow’r of peace,The rose that cannot wither,
    Thy fortress, and thy ease.Leave then thy foolish ranges,
    For none can thee secure,But One, who never changes,
    Thy God, thy life, thy cure.

Come here’s
a peach he said
and held it out just far
enough to reach beyond his lap
and off- 
ered me
a room the one
room left he said in all
of Thessaloniki that night
packed with 
traders
The peach was lush
I hadn’t slept for days
it was like velvet lips a lamp
he smiled 
patted
the bed for me
I knew it was in fact
the only room the only bed
The peach 
trembled
and he said Come
nodding to make me
agree I wanted the peach and
the bed 
he said
to take it see
how nice it was and I
thought how I could take it ginger-
ly my 
finger-
tips only touch-
ing only it Not in
or out I stayed in the doorway
watching 
a fly
He stroked the peach
and asked where I was from
I said the States he smiled and asked
how long 
I’d stay
The fly had found
the peach I said I’d leave
for Turkey in the morning I
wanted 
so much
to sleep and on
a bed I thought of all
the ways to say that word
and that 
they must
have gradient
meanings He asked me did
I want the peach and I said sure
and took 
it from
his hand He asked
then if I’d take the room
It costs too much I said and turned
to go 
He said
to stay a while
and we could talk The sun
was going down I said no thanks
I’d head 
out on
the late train but
could I still have the peach
and what else could he say to that
but yes

Believing each simple thing passes from a perception that is less clear
into one that is, eventually, more clear. Believing each simple thing contains 
within it a minimal unity beyond which whatever else can be
exists. That the two seeds, or four seeds, are where the pear will go and where 
it began. Black bark, blossoms in the mild rain, smelling like piss
in the spring rain, the chips and twigs raining down beneath our weight 
as we broke off bouquets for the teacher. “What is that smell?” she asked.
Stark, white, delicate, attached with green cuffs, 
twig to twig, the blooms bursting through the runnels that
held them. Five runnels made in the foil by five fingers.  The given world is infinite and reality is complete. 
That’s what I had written in the morning on the blackboard.
And then, going home, I was stalled 
again on the bridge. I looked up and out and there
I saw the girl flying and falling, flying and falling 
in the distance, in the narrow air between two buildings,
her arms outspread, over and over 
against the strip of sky and above the gravel, or grass
or ground—the light changed and I couldn’t see at all 
where or how she had dragged the trampoline
that must have been the yielding source of all her motion. 
If you find a sight like this a kind of gift or sign, you’ve missed the way
the mind seals over, the way the simplest thing pulls on its heavy hood 
and turns away slowly from a thought. For later, weeks later,
I was stalled again in mid-bridge and couldn’t remember, 
yet could vaguely remember, the sense that something
was about to happen, that the light 
would change like a bell or alarm
and that in turn would mean the time had come 
when everyone must leave the school—
with every sweater and pencil left in place 
—to burn, and burn
and burn back to the ground.

I 
1 
Pearl, the precious prize of a king,
Chastely set in cherished gold,
In all the East none equalling,   
No peer to her could I behold.
So round, so rare, a radiant thing,
So smooth she was, so small of mold,
Wherever I judged gems glimmering   
I set her apart, her price untold.
Alas, I lost her in earth’s green fold;
Through grass to the ground, I searched in vain.
I languish alone; my heart grows cold
For my precious pearl without a stain. 
2 
Since in that spot it slipped from me,
I lingered, longing for that delight   
That from my sins once set me free
And my happiness raised to the highest height.
Her going wounds me grievously;
It burns my breast both day and night.
Yet I never imagined a melody
So sweet as she, so brief, and slight.
But memory flowed through my mind’s sight:
I thought how her color in clods had lain
O dust that dims what once was bright,
My precious pearl without a stain. 
3 
Rare spices on that spot must spread:
Such riches there to rot have run,
Blooms of yellow and blue and red,
Their sheen a shimmer against the sun,
Flower and fruit nor faded nor dead,
Where the pearl dropped down in mouldering dun;
Each grass from a lifeless grain is bred,
Else to harvest no wheat were won:
Always from good is good begun.
So seemly a seed could not die in vain,
That sprig nor spice there would be none   
Of that precious pearl without a stain. 
4 
To the spot which I in speech portray,
I entered in that arbor green,
In August on a holy day,
When the corn is cut with sickles keen.
On the little rise where my pearl rolled away,
The fairest flowers formed a screen:
Gillyflower, ginger, gromwell spray,
With peonies powdered in between.
If they were seemly to be seen,
Far sweeter the scents from that domain,
More worthy her dwelling, well I ween,
My precious pearl without a stain. 
5 
I mourned, hands clenched, before that mound,
For the piercing cold of grief had caught
Me in the doleful dread and bound
My heart, though reason solace sought.
I longed for my pearl, locked in the ground,
While fierce contentions in me fought.
In Christ, though comfort could be found,
My wretched will was still distraught.
I fell upon that flowery plot.
Such odors eddied in my brain,
To sudden slumber I was brought
By that precious pearl without a stain.

Tottering and elastic, middle name of Groan,
ramfeezled after a hard night
at the corpse-polishing plant, slope-
shouldered, a half loaf
of bread, even his hair tired, famished,
fingering the diminished beans
in his pocket—you meet him.
On a thousand street corners you meet him,
emerging from the subway, emerging
from your own chest—this sight’s shrill,
metallic vapors pass into you.
His fear is of being broken,
of becoming too dexterous in stripping
the last few shoelaces of meat
from a chicken’s carcass, of being moved by nothing
short of the Fall of Rome, of being stooped
in the cranium over some loss he’s forgotten
the anniversary of.... You meet him,
know his defeat, though proper
and inevitable, is not yours, although yours also
is proper and inevitable: so many defeats
queer and insignificant (as illustration:
the first time you lay awake all night
waiting for dawn—and were disappointed), so many
no-hope exhaustions hidden,
their gaze dully glazed inward.—And yet we all
fix our binoculars on the horizon’s hazy fear-heaps
and cruise toward them, fat sails
forward.... You meet him on the corners,
in bus stations, on the blind avenues
leading neither in
nor out of hell, you meet him
and with him you walk.

for Laura



The island, you mustn’t say, had only rocks and scrub pine;
Was on a blue, bright day like a blemish in this landscape.
And Charlotte who is frail and the youngest of us collects
Sticks and branches to start our fires, cries as they burn
Because they resemble most what she has lost
Or has little of: long fingers, her toes,
And a left arm gone past the elbow, soon clear to her shoulder.
She has the mouth of sea perch. Five of our sisters wear
Green hoods. You are touched by all of this, but not by us.
To be touched by us, to be kissed! Sometimes
We see couples rowing in the distance in yellow coats. 
Sometimes they fish with handlines; we offend
Everyone who is offended most
And by everything and everyone. The five goats love us, though,
And live in our dark houses. When they are
Full with milk they climb the steps and beg that
They be milked. Their teats brush the steps and leave thick
Yellow trails of fresh milk. We are all females here.
Even the ghosts. We must wash, of course, in salt water,
But it smarts or maybe even hurts us. Often with a rope
Around her waist Anne is lowered entirely into the water.
She splashes around and screams in pain. Her screams
Sometimes carry clear to the beaches on the Cape.  For us I say so often. For us we say. For us! We are
Human and not individual, we hold everything in common.
We are individual, you could pick us out in a crowd.
You did. This island is not our prison. We are not kept
In; not even by our skin. 
Once Anne said she would love to be a Negro or a trout. 
We live without you. Father, I don’t know why I have written
You all this; but be proud for I am living, and yet each day
I am less and less your flesh. Someday, eventually, you
Should only think of me as being a lightning bug on the lawn,
Or the Negro fishing at the pond, or the fat trout he wraps
In leaves that he is showing to someone. I’ll be 
Most everything for you. And I’ll be gone.

or staple our hands to our foreheads
for refusing to salute them
if we did not hurt them first: mail them packages of rats,
mix their flour at night with broken glass.
We do this, they do that.
They peel the larynx from one of our brothers’ throats.
We devein one of their sisters.
The quicksand pits they built were good.
Our amputation teams were better.
We trained some birds to steal their wheat.
They sent to us exploding ambassadors of peace.
They do this, we do that.
We canceled our sheep imports.
They no longer bought our blankets.
We mocked their greatest poet
and when that had no effect
we parodied the way they dance
which did cause pain, so they, in turn, said our God
was leprous, hairless.
We do this, they do that.

The perfect mother lets the cat
sleep on her head. The
children laugh.
Where is she?
She is not carefully ironing the starched
ruffles of a Sunday dress.
What does she say?
She does not speak.
Her head is under the cat and
like the cat, she sleeps.  
       2 
But her children are in a marsh!
Bogged, they have gone wild.
Yet, no one should worry.
See, they are there, in a sunny kitchen.
They drink cups of soup and wipe
their faces with yellow napkins.
What does it matter if
they are hatching plots, if
in their waking dreams
the poor cat is trapped
its hair
standing on end?  
       3 
Where shall we go? We ask the perfect
mother. What
do you want of us? She is no
where to be found.
Not in the cookie jar
we have broken to bits
not under the shiny kitchen floor
not on our lips.
Here we are transfixed,
mourning the perfect mother, and she
is caught in the trapped cat
of her children’s dreams.

"F. . . the oven is an F"

Oh, to hear the world with such clarity.
Such surety. To know the note

That the ’57 Chevy stalled outside the

kitchen paint for what it is: F-sharp.
To understand the way you feel for him is G, definitely a G. And as you watch him
descend the scale of the front steps to his car
for work, the house quiets to an A.

The last time I saw Donald Armstrong   
He was staggering oddly off into the sun,   
Going down, off the Philippine Islands.   
I let my shovel fall, and put that hand
Above my eyes, and moved some way to one side
That his body might pass through the sun, 
And I saw how well he was not
Standing there on his hands,
On his spindle-shanked forearms balanced,   
Unbalanced, with his big feet looming and waving   
In the great, untrustworthy air
He flew in each night, when it darkened. 
Dust fanned in scraped puffs from the earth
Between his arms, and blood turned his face inside out,   
To demonstrate its suppleness
Of veins, as he perfected his role.
Next day, he toppled his head off
On an island beach to the south, 
And the enemy’s two-handed sword   
Did not fall from anyone’s hands   
At that miraculous sight,
As the head rolled over upon
Its wide-eyed face, and fell
Into the inadequate grave 
He had dug for himself, under pressure.   
Yet I put my flat hand to my eyebrows   
Months later, to see him again
In the sun, when I learned how he died,   
And imagined him, there,
Come, judged, before his small captors, 
Doing all his lean tricks to amaze them—
The back somersault, the kip-up—
And at last, the stand on his hands,   
Perfect, with his feet together,
His head down, evenly breathing,
As the sun poured from the sea 
And the headsman broke down   
In a blaze of tears, in that light   
Of the thin, long human frame   
Upside down in its own strange joy,
And, if some other one had not told him,   
Would have cut off the feet 
Instead of the head,
And if Armstrong had not presently risen   
In kingly, round-shouldered attendance,   
And then knelt down in himself
Beside his hacked, glittering grave, having done   
All things in this life that he could.

The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live. 
The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on. 
We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it. 
It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women. 
At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers. 
Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table. 
This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun. 
Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory. 
We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here. 
At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse. We give thanks. 
Perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and crying, eating of the last sweet bite.

This circle holding the afternoon sky is a lake
For summer business measured in stacked pairs
Of peeling oars whose dinghies all ship water.
Beside it on the trampled grass a carrousel shakes
And turns on an Old World instrument
The plink and plank and tinkle of a tune
Of plunging horses in fresh habiliment.
We catch the reins of enamel Pegasus
And lift the child until she is astride
A purple beast, where, wrapping infant arms
About his neck of wood, she whirls in space
And gallops off upon the turning wheel.
The horse climbs steadily the silver pole
Where cherubs hang, then slides toward spinning earth;
She sees the moving heaven of winged babes;
Rising to meet them, rising, she returns
To where our faces, staring in at hers,
Fixed, while her orbit whirls and sunlight burns,
Recede to artifact as her vision blurs.

Between people’s
ideals
and their realization
there is always
a greater drop
than in the highest
of waterfalls. 
This potential gradient
can be exploited
rationally,
if we build a sort of
power station above it. 
The energy it supplies,
even if we use it only
to light our cigarettes,
is something
anyway;
for while one is smoking
one can very seriously
think up
ideals even crazier.

Queer are the ways of a man I know:

        With moveless hands

        Then turns to go... And what does he see when he gazes so? 
                       II
They say he sees as an instant thing 
        More clear than to-day, 
        A sweet soft scene 
        That once was in play 
        By that briny green; 
        Yes, notes alway 
        Warm, real, and keen, 
        What his back years bring—A phantom of his own figuring. 
                       III
Of this vision of his they might say more: 
        Not only there 
        Does he see this sight, 
        But everywhere 
        In his brain–day, night, 
        As if on the air 
        It were drawn rose bright– 
        Yea, far from that shore Does he carry this vision of heretofore: 
                       IV
A ghost-girl-rider. And though, toil-tried, 
        He withers daily, 
        Time touches her not, 
        But she still rides gaily 
        In his rapt thought 
        On that shagged and shaly 
        Atlantic spot, 
        And as when first eyed Draws rein and sings to the swing of the tide.

Patience, though I have not    The thing that I require, I must of force, God wot,    Forbear my most desire; For no ways can I find   To sail against the wind.  Patience, do what they will    To work me woe or spite, I shall content me still    To think both day and night, To think and hold my peace, Since there is no redress.  Patience, withouten blame,    For I offended nought; I know they know the same,    Though they have changed their thought. Was ever thought so moved To hate that it hath loved?  Patience of all my harm,    For fortune is my foe; Patience must be the charm    To heal me of my woe: Patience without offence Is a painful patience.

Now, God be thanked who has matched us with his hour,       And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping! With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,       To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping, Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary;       Leave the sick hearts that honor could not move, And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,       And all the little emptiness of love! Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,       Where there’s no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,             Naught broken save this body, lost but breath; Nothing to shake the laughing heart’s long peace there,       But only agony, and that has ending;             And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.

My Soul, there is a country
    Afar beyond the stars,Where stands a winged sentry
    All skillful in the wars;There, above noise and danger
    Sweet Peace sits, crown’d with smiles,And One born in a manger
    Commands the beauteous files.He is thy gracious friend
    And (O my Soul awake!)Did in pure love descend,
    To die here for thy sake.If thou canst get but thither,
    There grows the flow’r of peace,The rose that cannot wither,
    Thy fortress, and thy ease.Leave then thy foolish ranges,
    For none can thee secure,But One, who never changes,
    Thy God, thy life, thy cure.

Come here’s
a peach he said
and held it out just far
enough to reach beyond his lap
and off- 
ered me
a room the one
room left he said in all
of Thessaloniki that night
packed with 
traders
The peach was lush
I hadn’t slept for days
it was like velvet lips a lamp
he smiled 
patted
the bed for me
I knew it was in fact
the only room the only bed
The peach 
trembled
and he said Come
nodding to make me
agree I wanted the peach and
the bed 
he said
to take it see
how nice it was and I
thought how I could take it ginger-
ly my 
finger-
tips only touch-
ing only it Not in
or out I stayed in the doorway
watching 
a fly
He stroked the peach
and asked where I was from
I said the States he smiled and asked
how long 
I’d stay
The fly had found
the peach I said I’d leave
for Turkey in the morning I
wanted 
so much
to sleep and on
a bed I thought of all
the ways to say that word
and that 
they must
have gradient
meanings He asked me did
I want the peach and I said sure
and took 
it from
his hand He asked
then if I’d take the room
It costs too much I said and turned
to go 
He said
to stay a while
and we could talk The sun
was going down I said no thanks
I’d head 
out on
the late train but
could I still have the peach
and what else could he say to that
but yes

Believing each simple thing passes from a perception that is less clear
into one that is, eventually, more clear. Believing each simple thing contains 
within it a minimal unity beyond which whatever else can be
exists. That the two seeds, or four seeds, are where the pear will go and where 
it began. Black bark, blossoms in the mild rain, smelling like piss
in the spring rain, the chips and twigs raining down beneath our weight 
as we broke off bouquets for the teacher. “What is that smell?” she asked.
Stark, white, delicate, attached with green cuffs, 
twig to twig, the blooms bursting through the runnels that
held them. Five runnels made in the foil by five fingers.  The given world is infinite and reality is complete. 
That’s what I had written in the morning on the blackboard.
And then, going home, I was stalled 
again on the bridge. I looked up and out and there
I saw the girl flying and falling, flying and falling 
in the distance, in the narrow air between two buildings,
her arms outspread, over and over 
against the strip of sky and above the gravel, or grass
or ground—the light changed and I couldn’t see at all 
where or how she had dragged the trampoline
that must have been the yielding source of all her motion. 
If you find a sight like this a kind of gift or sign, you’ve missed the way
the mind seals over, the way the simplest thing pulls on its heavy hood 
and turns away slowly from a thought. For later, weeks later,
I was stalled again in mid-bridge and couldn’t remember, 
yet could vaguely remember, the sense that something
was about to happen, that the light 
would change like a bell or alarm
and that in turn would mean the time had come 
when everyone must leave the school—
with every sweater and pencil left in place 
—to burn, and burn
and burn back to the ground.

I 
1 
Pearl, the precious prize of a king,
Chastely set in cherished gold,
In all the East none equalling,   
No peer to her could I behold.
So round, so rare, a radiant thing,
So smooth she was, so small of mold,
Wherever I judged gems glimmering   
I set her apart, her price untold.
Alas, I lost her in earth’s green fold;
Through grass to the ground, I searched in vain.
I languish alone; my heart grows cold
For my precious pearl without a stain. 
2 
Since in that spot it slipped from me,
I lingered, longing for that delight   
That from my sins once set me free
And my happiness raised to the highest height.
Her going wounds me grievously;
It burns my breast both day and night.
Yet I never imagined a melody
So sweet as she, so brief, and slight.
But memory flowed through my mind’s sight:
I thought how her color in clods had lain
O dust that dims what once was bright,
My precious pearl without a stain. 
3 
Rare spices on that spot must spread:
Such riches there to rot have run,
Blooms of yellow and blue and red,
Their sheen a shimmer against the sun,
Flower and fruit nor faded nor dead,
Where the pearl dropped down in mouldering dun;
Each grass from a lifeless grain is bred,
Else to harvest no wheat were won:
Always from good is good begun.
So seemly a seed could not die in vain,
That sprig nor spice there would be none   
Of that precious pearl without a stain. 
4 
To the spot which I in speech portray,
I entered in that arbor green,
In August on a holy day,
When the corn is cut with sickles keen.
On the little rise where my pearl rolled away,
The fairest flowers formed a screen:
Gillyflower, ginger, gromwell spray,
With peonies powdered in between.
If they were seemly to be seen,
Far sweeter the scents from that domain,
More worthy her dwelling, well I ween,
My precious pearl without a stain. 
5 
I mourned, hands clenched, before that mound,
For the piercing cold of grief had caught
Me in the doleful dread and bound
My heart, though reason solace sought.
I longed for my pearl, locked in the ground,
While fierce contentions in me fought.
In Christ, though comfort could be found,
My wretched will was still distraught.
I fell upon that flowery plot.
Such odors eddied in my brain,
To sudden slumber I was brought
By that precious pearl without a stain.

Tottering and elastic, middle name of Groan,
ramfeezled after a hard night
at the corpse-polishing plant, slope-
shouldered, a half loaf
of bread, even his hair tired, famished,
fingering the diminished beans
in his pocket—you meet him.
On a thousand street corners you meet him,
emerging from the subway, emerging
from your own chest—this sight’s shrill,
metallic vapors pass into you.
His fear is of being broken,
of becoming too dexterous in stripping
the last few shoelaces of meat
from a chicken’s carcass, of being moved by nothing
short of the Fall of Rome, of being stooped
in the cranium over some loss he’s forgotten
the anniversary of.... You meet him,
know his defeat, though proper
and inevitable, is not yours, although yours also
is proper and inevitable: so many defeats
queer and insignificant (as illustration:
the first time you lay awake all night
waiting for dawn—and were disappointed), so many
no-hope exhaustions hidden,
their gaze dully glazed inward.—And yet we all
fix our binoculars on the horizon’s hazy fear-heaps
and cruise toward them, fat sails
forward.... You meet him on the corners,
in bus stations, on the blind avenues
leading neither in
nor out of hell, you meet him
and with him you walk.

for Laura



The island, you mustn’t say, had only rocks and scrub pine;
Was on a blue, bright day like a blemish in this landscape.
And Charlotte who is frail and the youngest of us collects
Sticks and branches to start our fires, cries as they burn
Because they resemble most what she has lost
Or has little of: long fingers, her toes,
And a left arm gone past the elbow, soon clear to her shoulder.
She has the mouth of sea perch. Five of our sisters wear
Green hoods. You are touched by all of this, but not by us.
To be touched by us, to be kissed! Sometimes
We see couples rowing in the distance in yellow coats. 
Sometimes they fish with handlines; we offend
Everyone who is offended most
And by everything and everyone. The five goats love us, though,
And live in our dark houses. When they are
Full with milk they climb the steps and beg that
They be milked. Their teats brush the steps and leave thick
Yellow trails of fresh milk. We are all females here.
Even the ghosts. We must wash, of course, in salt water,
But it smarts or maybe even hurts us. Often with a rope
Around her waist Anne is lowered entirely into the water.
She splashes around and screams in pain. Her screams
Sometimes carry clear to the beaches on the Cape.  For us I say so often. For us we say. For us! We are
Human and not individual, we hold everything in common.
We are individual, you could pick us out in a crowd.
You did. This island is not our prison. We are not kept
In; not even by our skin. 
Once Anne said she would love to be a Negro or a trout. 
We live without you. Father, I don’t know why I have written
You all this; but be proud for I am living, and yet each day
I am less and less your flesh. Someday, eventually, you
Should only think of me as being a lightning bug on the lawn,
Or the Negro fishing at the pond, or the fat trout he wraps
In leaves that he is showing to someone. I’ll be 
Most everything for you. And I’ll be gone.

People getting divorced

         hanging on somehow
                                     to walk again

hate the people of this village
and would nail our hats
to our heads for refusing in their presence to remove them
or staple our hands to our foreheads
for refusing to salute them
if we did not hurt them first: mail them packages of rats,
mix their flour at night with broken glass.
We do this, they do that.
They peel the larynx from one of our brothers’ throats.
We devein one of their sisters.
The quicksand pits they built were good.
Our amputation teams were better.
We trained some birds to steal their wheat.
They sent to us exploding ambassadors of peace.
They do this, we do that.
We canceled our sheep imports.
They no longer bought our blankets.
We mocked their greatest poet
and when that had no effect
we parodied the way they dance
which did cause pain, so they, in turn, said our God
was leprous, hairless.
We do this, they do that.
Ten thousand (10,000) years, ten thousand
(10,000) brutal, beautiful years.

The perfect mother lets the cat
sleep on her head. The
children laugh.
Where is she?
She is not carefully ironing the starched
ruffles of a Sunday dress.
What does she say?
She does not speak.
Her head is under the cat and
like the cat, she sleeps.  
       2 
But her children are in a marsh!
Bogged, they have gone wild.
Yet, no one should worry.
See, they are there, in a sunny kitchen.
They drink cups of soup and wipe
their faces with yellow napkins.
What does it matter if
they are hatching plots, if
in their waking dreams
the poor cat is trapped
its hair
standing on end?  
       3 
Where shall we go? We ask the perfect
mother. What
do you want of us? She is no
where to be found.
Not in the cookie jar
we have broken to bits
not under the shiny kitchen floor
not on our lips.
Here we are transfixed,
mourning the perfect mother, and she
is caught in the trapped cat
of her children’s dreams.

"F. . . the oven is an F"
Samantha Foggle, age 3



Oh, to hear the world with such clarity.
Such surety. To know the note
of your breakfast chat is B-flat minor.
That the ’57 Chevy stalled outside the
garage is a D. To recognize the Apricot
kitchen paint for what it is: F-sharp.
To understand the way you feel for him is G, definitely a G. And as you watch him
descend the scale of the front steps to his car
for work, the house quiets to an A.
The arpeggio of last night’s Every
Good Boy Deserves Favor
still ringing in your ears.

The last time I saw Donald Armstrong   
He was staggering oddly off into the sun,   
Going down, off the Philippine Islands.   
I let my shovel fall, and put that hand
Above my eyes, and moved some way to one side
That his body might pass through the sun, 
And I saw how well he was not
Standing there on his hands,
On his spindle-shanked forearms balanced,   
Unbalanced, with his big feet looming and waving   
In the great, untrustworthy air
He flew in each night, when it darkened. 
Dust fanned in scraped puffs from the earth
Between his arms, and blood turned his face inside out,   
To demonstrate its suppleness
Of veins, as he perfected his role.
Next day, he toppled his head off
On an island beach to the south, 
And the enemy’s two-handed sword   
Did not fall from anyone’s hands   
At that miraculous sight,
As the head rolled over upon
Its wide-eyed face, and fell
Into the inadequate grave 
He had dug for himself, under pressure.   
Yet I put my flat hand to my eyebrows   
Months later, to see him again
In the sun, when I learned how he died,   
And imagined him, there,
Come, judged, before his small captors, 
Doing all his lean tricks to amaze them—
The back somersault, the kip-up—
And at last, the stand on his hands,   
Perfect, with his feet together,
His head down, evenly breathing,
As the sun poured from the sea 
And the headsman broke down   
In a blaze of tears, in that light   
Of the thin, long human frame   
Upside down in its own strange joy,
And, if some other one had not told him,   
Would have cut off the feet 
Instead of the head,
And if Armstrong had not presently risen   
In kingly, round-shouldered attendance,   
And then knelt down in himself
Beside his hacked, glittering grave, having done   
All things in this life that he could.

The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live. 
The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on. 
We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it. 
It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women. 
At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers. 
Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table. 
This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun. 
Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory. 
We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here. 
At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse. We give thanks. 
Perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and crying, eating of the last sweet bite.

This circle holding the afternoon sky is a lake
For summer business measured in stacked pairs
Of peeling oars whose dinghies all ship water.
Beside it on the trampled grass a carrousel shakes
And turns on an Old World instrument
The plink and plank and tinkle of a tune
Of plunging horses in fresh habiliment.
We catch the reins of enamel Pegasus
And lift the child until she is astride
A purple beast, where, wrapping infant arms
About his neck of wood, she whirls in space
And gallops off upon the turning wheel.
The horse climbs steadily the silver pole
Where cherubs hang, then slides toward spinning earth;
She sees the moving heaven of winged babes;
Rising to meet them, rising, she returns
To where our faces, staring in at hers,
Fixed, while her orbit whirls and sunlight burns,
Recede to artifact as her vision blurs.

Between people’s
ideals
and their realization
there is always
a greater drop
than in the highest
of waterfalls. 
This potential gradient
can be exploited
rationally,
if we build a sort of
power station above it. 
The energy it supplies,
even if we use it only
to light our cigarettes,
is something
anyway;
for while one is smoking
one can very seriously
think up
ideals even crazier.

One granite ridge
A tree, would be enough
Or even a rock, a small creek,
A bark shred in a pool.
Hill beyond hill, folded and twisted   
Tough trees crammed
In thin stone fractures
A huge moon on it all, is too much.   
The mind wanders. A million
Summers, night air still and the rocks   
Warm.   Sky over endless mountains.   
All the junk that goes with being human   
Drops away, hard rock wavers
Even the heavy present seems to fail   
This bubble of a heart.
Words and books
Like a small creek off a high ledge   
Gone in the dry air. 
A clear, attentive mind
Has no meaning but that
Which sees is truly seen.
No one loves rock, yet we are here.   
Night chills. A flick
In the moonlight
Slips into Juniper shadow:
Back there unseen
Cold proud eyes
Of Cougar or Coyote
Watch me rise and go.

There is no warning rattle at the door   
nor heavy feet to stomp the foyer boards.   
Safe in the dark prison, I know that   
light slides over
the fingered work of a toothless   
woman in Pakistan.
Happy prints of
an invisible time are illumined.   
My mouth agape
rejects the solid air and
lungs hold. The invader takes   
direction and
seeps through the plaster walls.   
It is at my chamber, entering   
the keyhole, pushing
through the padding of the door.   
I cannot scream. A bone
of fear clogs my throat.
It is upon me. It is
sunrise, with Hope
its arrogant rider.
My mind, formerly quiescent
in its snug encasement, is strained
to look upon their rapturous visages,   
to let them enter even into me.   
I am forced
outside myself to
mount the light and ride joined with Hope. 
Through all the bright hours   
I cling to expectation, until   
darkness comes to reclaim me
as its own. Hope fades, day is gone   
into its irredeemable place
and I am thrown back into the familiar   
bonds of disconsolation.
Gloom crawls around
lapping lasciviously
between my toes, at my ankles,   
and it sucks the strands of my   
hair. It forgives my heady   
fling with Hope. I am
joined again into its
greedy arms.

                                                            encountering the NOVA

             Tycho whispering at last

What we see, we see

Heartbeat of the pulsar

I am a galactic cloud so deep      so invo-

^^EOP^^

Soon I will make my appearance
But first I must take off my rings
And swords and lay them out all
Along the lupine banks of the forbidden river
In reckoning the days I have
Left on this earth I will use
No fingers

  Indeed I must confess,
 When souls mix ’tis an happiness,But not complete till bodies too do join,And both our wholes into one whole combine;But half of heaven the souls in glory taste
 Till by love in heaven at last 
 Their bodies too are placed.
                   2
  In thy immortal part
 Man, as well as I, thou art.But something ’tis that differs thee and me,And we must one even in that difference be.I thee both as a man and woman prize,
 For a perfect love implies
 Love in all capacities.
                   3
  Can that for true love pass
 When a fair woman courts her glass?Something unlike must in love’s likeness be:His wonder is one and variety.For he whose soul nought but a soul can move
 Does a new Narcissus prove,
 And his own image love.
                   4
  That souls do beauty know
 ’Tis to the body’s help they owe;If when they know’t they straight abuse that trustAnd shut the body from’t, ’tis as unjustAs if I brought my dearest friend to see
 My mistress and at th’instant he
 Should steal her quite from me.

Raymond Roussel



Two girls runaway from the Home.  They have a revolver
in their possession.  The Sisters Of Our Lady have given up
looking for them, returning in the night with soft candles.
The sleek clouds have thrown their riders, and the bees
are returning to the honey, the clover at the edge of the   
cliff black as eyelids, damp as blue mussels flexing at the moon.
The girls look in the stolen mirror, then throw their shoes
in the sea.  They take off one another’s dress, posing
on the rocks that jut out over the faded water of the last days.
The clover beat down from their splendid feet, the clover
quiet like a vault.  Nearby in a ship named for early death,
I drink wine like a city.  Anchored far off the continent of love.   
Strange, but bees do not die in their own honey, and how the dead
are toted off, how the sweet moons are deposited in the catacombs.
The clover at the edge of the sea like a chemise, place
where animals have lain.  They help one another with their hair,
their dresses blowing back to land.  They look over the
cliff, spit on the beach.  Birds I have never seen going by.


^^EOP^^

Wheel of sorrow, centerless.
Voices, sad without cause,
slope upward, expiring on grave summits.   
Mournfulness of muddy playgrounds,   
raw smell of rubbers and wrapped lunches   
when little girls stand in a circle singing   
of windows and of lovers. 
Hearing them, no one could tell
why they sing sadly, but there is in their voices   
the pathos of all handed-down garments   
hanging loosely on small bodies.
 


^^EOP^^

The ants came   
to investigate   
the dead
bull snake,   
nibbled
at the viscera   
and hurried off   
with full mouths   
waving wild   
antenae. 
Moths alighted,   
beetles swarmed,   
flies buzzed
in the stomach. 
Three crows   
tugged and tore   
and flew off
to their oak tree
with the skin. 
In every house
men, women and children   
were chewing beef. 
Who was it said
“The wonder of the world   
is its comprehensibility”?


^^EOP^^

When the rain hits the snake in the head,
he closes his eyes and wishes he were
asleep in a tire on the side of the road,
so young boys could roll him over, forever.


^^EOP^^

for years the scenes bustled   
through him as he dreamed he was   
alive. then he felt real, and slammed 
awake in the wet sheets screaming    too fast, everything moves
too fast, and the edges of things   
are gone.

A few years back and they told me Black
means a hole where other folks
got brain/it was like the cells in the heads
of Black children was out to every hour on the hour naps
Scientists called the phenomenon the Notorious
Jensen Lapse, remember?
Anyway I was thinking
about how to devise
a test for the wise
like a Stanford-Binet
for the C.I.A.
you know?
Take Einstein
being the most the unquestionable the outstanding
the maximal mind of the century
right?
And I’m struggling against this lapse leftover
from my Black childhood to fathom why
anybody should say so: E=mc squared?
I try that on this old lady live on my block:
She sweeping away Saturday night from the stoop
and mad as can be because some absolute
jackass have left a kingsize mattress where
she have to sweep around it stains and all she
don’t want to know nothing about in the first place
“Mrs. Johnson!” I say, leaning on the gate
between us: “What you think about somebody come up
with an E equals M C 2?”
“How you doin,” she answer me, sideways, like she don’t
want to let on she know I ain’
combed my hair yet and here it is
Sunday morning but still I have the nerve
to be bothering serious work with these crazy
questions about
“E equals what you say again, dear?”
Then I tell her, “Well
also this same guy? I think
he was undisputed Father of the Atom Bomb!”
“That right.” She mumbles or grumbles, not too politely
“And dint remember to wear socks when he put on
his shoes!” I add on (getting desperate)
at which point Mrs. Johnson take herself and her broom
a very big step down the stoop away from me
“And never did nothing for nobody in particular
lessen it was a committee
and
used to say, ‘What time is it?’
and
you’d say, ‘Six o’clock.’
and
he’d say, ‘Day or night?’
and
and he never made nobody a cup a tea
in his whole brilliant life!
and
[my voice rises slightly]
and
he dint never boogie neither: never!” 
“Well,” say Mrs. Johnson, “Well, honey,
I do guess
that’s genius for you.”


^^EOP^^

Even tonight and I need to take a walk and clear
my head about this poem about why I can’t
go out without changing my clothes my shoes
my body posture my gender identity my age
my status as a woman alone in the evening/
alone on the streets/alone not being the point/
the point being that I can’t do what I want
to do with my own body because I am the wrong
sex the wrong age the wrong skin and
suppose it was not here in the city but down on the beach/
or far into the woods and I wanted to go
there by myself thinking about God/or thinking
about children or thinking about the world/all of it
disclosed by the stars and the silence:
I could not go and I could not think and I could not
stay there
alone
as I need to be
alone because I can’t do what I want to do with my own
body and
who in the hell set things up
like this
and in France they say if the guy penetrates
but does not ejaculate then he did not rape me
and if after stabbing him if after screams if
after begging the bastard and if even after smashing
a hammer to his head if even after that if he
and his buddies fuck me after that
then I consented and there was
no rape because finally you understand finally
they fucked me over because I was wrong I was
wrong again to be me being me where I was/wrong
to be who I am
which is exactly like South Africa
penetrating into Namibia penetrating into
Angola and does that mean I mean how do you know if
Pretoria ejaculates what will the evidence look like the
proof of the monster jackboot ejaculation on Blackland
and if
after Namibia and if after Angola and if after Zimbabwe
and if after all of my kinsmen and women resist even to
self-immolation of the villages and if after that
we lose nevertheless what will the big boys say will they
claim my consent:
Do You Follow Me: We are the wrong people of
the wrong skin on the wrong continent and what
in the hell is everybody being reasonable about
and according to the Times this week
back in 1966 the C.I.A. decided that they had this problem
and the problem was a man named Nkrumah so they
killed him and before that it was Patrice Lumumba
and before that it was my father on the campus
of my Ivy League school and my father afraid
to walk into the cafeteria because he said he
was wrong the wrong age the wrong skin the wrong
gender identity and he was paying my tuition and
before that
it was my father saying I was wrong saying that
I should have been a boy because he wanted one/a
boy and that I should have been lighter skinned and
that I should have had straighter hair and that
I should not be so boy crazy but instead I should
just be one/a boy and before that         
it was my mother pleading plastic surgery for
my nose and braces for my teeth and telling me
to let the books loose to let them loose in other
words
I am very familiar with the problems of the C.I.A.
and the problems of South Africa and the problems
of Exxon Corporation and the problems of white
America in general and the problems of the teachers
and the preachers and the F.B.I. and the social
workers and my particular Mom and Dad/I am very
familiar with the problems because the problems
turn out to be
me
I am the history of rape
I am the history of the rejection of who I am
I am the history of the terrorized incarceration of
myself
I am the history of battery assault and limitless
armies against whatever I want to do with my mind
and my body and my soul and
whether it’s about walking out at night
or whether it’s about the love that I feel or
whether it’s about the sanctity of my vagina or
the sanctity of my national boundaries
or the sanctity of my leaders or the sanctity
of each and every desire
that I know from my personal and idiosyncratic
and indisputably single and singular heart
I have been raped
be-
cause I have been wrong the wrong sex the wrong age
the wrong skin the wrong nose the wrong hair the
wrong need the wrong dream the wrong geographic
the wrong sartorial I
I have been the meaning of rape
I have been the problem everyone seeks to
eliminate by forced
penetration with or without the evidence of slime and/
but let this be unmistakable this poem
is not consent I do not consent
to my mother to my father to the teachers to
the F.B.I. to South Africa to Bedford-Stuy
to Park Avenue to American Airlines to the hardon
idlers on the corners to the sneaky creeps in
cars I am not wrong: Wrong is not my name
My name is my own my own my own
and I can’t tell you who the hell set things up like this
but I can tell you that from now on my resistance
my simple and daily and nightly self-determination
may very well cost you your life

I

The light foot hears you and the brightness begins
god-step at the margins of thought,
      quick adulterous tread at the heart.   
Who is it that goes there?
      Where I see your quick face
notes of an old music pace the air,   
torso-reverberations of a Grecian lyre.

In Goya’s canvas Cupid and Psyche   
have a hurt voluptuous grace
bruised by redemption. The copper light   
falling upon the brown boy’s slight body
is carnal fate that sends the soul wailing   
up from blind innocence, ensnared   
      by dimness
into the deprivations of desiring sight.

But the eyes in Goya’s painting are soft,
diffuse with rapture absorb the flame.
Their bodies yield out of strength.
      Waves of visual pleasure
wrap them in a sorrow previous to their impatience.

A bronze of yearning, a rose that burns   
      the tips of their bodies, lips,
ends of fingers, nipples. He is not wingd.   
His thighs are flesh, are clouds
      lit by the sun in its going down,
hot luminescence at the loins of the visible.

      But they are not in a landscape.   
      They exist in an obscurity.

The wind spreading the sail serves them.
The two jealous sisters eager for her ruin
      serve them.
That she is ignorant, ignorant of what Love will be,   

      serves them.
The dark serves them.
The oil scalding his shoulder serves them,
serves their story. Fate, spinning,
      knots the threads for Love.

Jealousy, ignorance, the hurt . . . serve them.

This is magic. It is passionate dispersion.   
What if they grow old? The gods
      would not allow it.
      Psyche is preserved.

In time we see a tragedy, a loss of beauty   
      the glittering youth
of the god retains—but from this threshold   
      it is age
that is beautiful. It is toward the old poets   
      we go, to their faltering,
their unaltering wrongness that has style,   
      their variable truth,
      the old faces,
words shed like tears from
a plenitude of powers time stores.

A stroke.   These little strokes.   A chill.   
      The old man, feeble, does not recoil.   
Recall. A phase so minute,
      only a part of the word in- jerrd.

      The Thundermakers descend,

damerging a nuv. A nerb.
      The present dented of the U
nighted stayd. States. The heavy clod?   
      Cloud. Invades the brain. What   
      if lilacs last in this dooryard bloomd?

Hoover, Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower—
where among these did the power reside
that moves the heart? What flower of the nation   
bride-sweet broke to the whole rapture?   
Hoover, Coolidge, Harding, Wilson
hear the factories of human misery turning out commodities.   
For whom are the holy matins of the heart ringing?
Noble men in the quiet of morning hear   
Indians singing the continent’s violent requiem.   
Harding, Wilson, Taft, Roosevelt,   
idiots fumbling at the bride’s door,
hear the cries of men in meaningless debt and war.
Where among these did the spirit reside   
that restores the land to productive order?   
McKinley, Cleveland, Harrison, Arthur,
Garfield, Hayes, Grant, Johnson,
dwell in the roots of the heart’s rancor.
How sad “amid lanes and through old woods”   
   echoes Whitman’s love for Lincoln!

There is no continuity then. Only a few
      posts of the good remain. I too
that am a nation sustain the damage
      where smokes of continual ravage
obscure the flame.
                              It is across great scars of wrong   
      I reach toward the song of kindred men   
      and strike again the naked string
old Whitman sang from. Glorious mistake!   
      that cried:

      “The theme is creative and has vista.”   
      “He is the president of regulation.”

      I see always the under side turning,   
fumes that injure the tender landscape.   
      From which up break
lilac blossoms of courage in daily act   
      striving to meet a natural measure.


III      (for Charles Olson)

                                              Psyche’s tasks—the sorting of seeds   
wheat      barley      oats      poppy      coriander
anise      beans      lentils      peas      —every grain
                                  in its right place
                                                               before nightfall;

gathering the gold wool from the cannibal sheep   
(for the soul must weep
       and come near upon death);

harrowing Hell for a casket Proserpina keeps
                                                            that must not
      be opend . . . containing beauty?   
no!      Melancholy coild like a serpent
                                                          that is deadly sleep
      we are not permitted
                                     to succumb to.

      These are the old tasks.   
      You’ve heard them before.

      They must be impossible. Psyche
must despair, be brought to her
                                                insect instructor;   
must obey the counsels of the green reed;
saved from suicide by a tower speaking,
      must follow to the letter
      freakish instructions.

In the story the ants help. The old man at Pisa   
      mixd in whose mind
(to draw the sorts) are all seeds
            as a lone ant from a broken ant-hill 
had part restored by an insect, was
      upheld by a lizard

                      (to draw the sorts)
the wind is part of the process
                      defines a nation of the wind—

      father of many notions,
                                        Who?
let the light into the dark? began   
the many movements of the passion?

                                                      West
from east   men push.
                              The islands are blessd   
(cursed)   that swim below the sun,

   man upon whom the sun has gone down!

There is the hero who struggles east   
widdershins to free the dawn   and must
                                             woo Night’s daughter,
sorcery, black passionate rage, covetous queens,   
so that the fleecy sun go   back from Troy,
      Colchis, India . . . all the blazing armies
spent, he must struggle alone toward the pyres of Day.

                                             The light that is Love   
rushes on toward passion. It verges upon dark.   
      Roses and blood flood the clouds.
      Solitary first riders advance into legend.

   This land, where I stand, was all legend   
in my grandfathers’ time: cattle raiders,   
   animal tribes, priests, gold.
It was the West. Its vistas painters saw
   in diffuse light, in melancholy,
in abysses left by glaciers as if they had been the sun
   primordial carving empty enormities
                                 out of the rock.

                                 Snakes lurkd
guarding secrets.         Those first ones   
                                 survived solitude.

      Scientia
holding the lamp, driven by doubt;   
Eros naked in foreknowledge   
smiling in his sleep;    and the light   
spilld, burning his shoulder—the outrage
      that conquers legend—
passion, dismay, longing, search   
      flooding up where
the Beloved is lost. Psyche travels   
life after life, my life, station
      after station,
to be tried

      without break, without
news, knowing only—but what did she know?   
      The oracle at Miletus had spoken
truth surely: that he was Serpent-Desire   
      that flies thru the air,
a monster-husband. But she saw him fair

whom Apollo’s mouthpiece said spread   
      pain
beyond cure    to those
      wounded by his arrows.

Rilke torn by a rose thorn
blackend toward Eros.          Cupidinous Death!   
      that will not take no for an answer.


IV      

       Oh yes!      Bless the footfall where
step by step      the boundary walker
(in Maverick Road      the snow
thud by thud      from the roof   
circling the house—another tread)

   that foot      informd
by the weight of all things
      that can be elusive
no more than a nearness to the mind   
      of a single image

            Oh yes!      this
most dear
      the catalyst force that renders clear
the days of a life from the surrounding medium!

            Yes, beautiful rare wilderness!
wildness that verifies strength of my tame mind,   
      clearing held against indians,
health that prepared to meet death,
      the stubborn hymns going up
into the ramifications of the hostile air

      that, decaptive, gives way.
Who is there?   O, light the light!
      The Indians give way, the clearing falls.   
Great Death gives way   and unprepares us.
      Lust gives way.    The Moon gives way.   
Night gives way.   Minutely,   the Day gains.

She saw the body of her beloved
      dismemberd in waking . . . or was it
in sight? Finders Keepers we sang
      when we were children      or were taught to sing
before our histories began      and we began
      who were beloved      our animal life
toward the Beloved,      sworn to be Keepers.

      On the hill before the wind came   
the grass moved toward the one sea,   
      blade after blade dancing in waves.

There the children turn the ring to the left.   
There the children turn the ring to the right.   
      Dancing . . . Dancing . . .

And the lonely psyche goes up thru the boy to the king   
      that in the caves of history dreams.
Round and round the children turn.
      London Bridge that is a kingdom falls.

We have come so far that all the old stories
whisper once more.
Mount Segur, Mount Victoire, Mount Tamalpais . . .   
      rise to adore the mystery of Love!

(An ode? Pindar’s art, the editors tell us, was not a statue but a mosaic, an accumulation of metaphor. But if he was archaic, not classic, a survival of obsolete mode, there may have been old voices in the survival that directed the heart. So, a line from a hymn came in a novel I was reading to help me. Psyche, poised to leap—and Pindar too, the editors write, goes too far, topples over—listend to a tower that said, Listen to Me! The oracle had said, Despair! The Gods themselves abhor his power. And then the virgin flower of the dark falls back flesh of our flesh from which everywhere . . .

      the information flows
         that is yearning. A line of Pindar   
      moves from the area of my lamp   
         toward morning.

      In the dawn that is nowhere
         I have seen the willful children

      clockwise and counter-clockwise turning.

How do we come to be here next to each other   
in the night
Where are the stars that show us to our love   
inevitable
Outside the leaves flame usual in darkness   
and the rain
falls cool and blessed on the holy flesh   
the black men waiting on the corner for   
a womanly mirage
I am amazed by peace
It is this possibility of you
asleep
and breathing in the quiet air

Passing the American graveyard, for my birthday
the crosses stuttering, white on tropical green,
the years’ quick focus of faces I do not remember . . . 
The palm trees stalking like deliberate giants
for my birthday, and all the hot adolescent memories
seen through a screen of water . . . 
For my birthday thrust into the adult and actual:
expected to perform the action, not to ponder
the reality beyond the fact,
the man standing upright in the dream.

What will we do

sit on top this mountainside above
the Pacific
checking out the flowers
the California poppies orange
as I meet myself in heat
                           I’m wondering where’s the Indians? 
                           all this filmstrip territory
                           all this cowboy sagaland:
                           not
                           a single Indian
                           in sight
                   
40,000 gallons gushing up poison
from the deepest seabeds
every hour 
40,000 gallons
while
experts international
while
new pollutants
swallow the unfathomable
still: 
         no Indians 
I’m staring hard around me
past the pinks the poppies and the precipice
that let me see the wide Pacific
unsuspecting
even trivial
by virtue of its vast surrender 
I am a woman searching for her savagery
even if it’s doomed  Where are the Indians? 
       * 
Crow Nose

the people of the sacred trees
and rivers precious to the stars that told
old stories to the night  how do we follow after you? 
falling
snow before the firelight
and buffalo as brothers
to the man  how do we follow into that? 
       * 
They found her facedown
where she would be dancing
to the shadow drums that humble
birds to silent
         flight
They found her body held
its life dispelled
by ice
my life burns to destroy 
Anna Mae Pictou Aquash
slain on The Trail of Broken Treaties
bullet lodged in her brain/hands
and fingertips dismembered 
who won the only peace
that cannot pass
from mouth to mouth 
       * 
Memory should agitate
the pierced bone crack
of one in pushed-back horror
pushed-back pain
as when I call out looking for my face
among the wounded coins
to toss about
or out
entirely
the legends of Geronimo
of Pocahontas
now become a squat
pedestrian cement inside the tomb
of all my trust 
as when I feel you isolate
among the hungers of the trees
a trembling
hidden tinder so long unsolicited
by flame 
as when I accept my sister dead
when there should be
a fluid holiness
of spirits wrapped around the world
redeemed by women
whispering communion 
       * 
I find my way by following your spine 
Your heart indivisible from my real wish
we
compelled the moon into the evening when
you said, “No,
I will not let go
of your hand.” 
       *
                                    
Now I am diving for a tide to take me everywhere 
Below
the soft Pacific spoils
a purple girdling of the globe
impregnable

described Anti-Government Disturbances as

The cruel majority emerges! 
Hail to the cruel majority! 
They will punish the poor for being poor.
They will punish the dead for having died. 
Nothing can make the dark turn into light
for the cruel majority.
Nothing can make them feel hunger or terror. 
If the cruel majority would only cup their ears
the sea would wash over them.
The sea would help them forget their wayward children.
It would weave a lullaby for young & old. 
(See the cruel majority with hands cupped to their ears,
one foot is in the water, one foot is on the clouds.) 
One man of them is large enough to hold a cloud
between his thumb & middle finger,
to squeeze a drop of sweat from it before he sleeps. 
He is a little god but not a poet.
(See how his body heaves.) 
The cruel majority love crowds & picnics.
The cruel majority fill up their parks with little flags.
The cruel majority celebrate their birthday. 
Hail to the cruel majority again! 
The cruel majority weep for their unborn children,
they weep for the children that they will never bear.
The cruel majority are overwhelmed by sorrow. 
(Then why are the cruel majority always laughing?
Is it because night has covered up the city's walls?
Because the poor lie hidden in the darkness?
The maimed no longer come to show their wounds?) 
Today the cruel majority vote to enlarge the darkness. 
They vote for shadows to take the place of ponds
Whatever they vote for they can bring to pass.
The mountains skip like lambs for the cruel majority. 
Hail to the cruel majority!
Hail! hail! to the cruel majority! 
The mountains skip like lambs, the hills like rams.
The cruel majority tear up the earth for the cruel majority.
Then the cruel majority line up to be buried. 
Those who love death will love the cruel majority. 
Those who know themselves will know the fear
the cruel majority feel when they look in the mirror. 
The cruel majority order the poor to stay poor.
They order the sun to shine only on weekdays. 
The god of the cruel majority is hanging from a tree.
Their god's voice is the tree screaming as it bends.
The tree's voice is as quick as lightning as it streaks across the sky. 
(If the cruel majority go to sleep inside their shadows,
they will wake to find their beds filled up with glass.) 
Hail to the god of the cruel majority!
Hail to the eyes in the head of their screaming god! 
Hail to his face in the mirror! 
Hail to their faces as they float around him! 
Hail to their blood & to his! 
Hail to the blood of the poor they need to feed them!
Hail to their world & their god! 
Hail & farewell!
Hail & farewell!
Hail & farewell!

Put nothing down to distress the reader.
No barking dog.
No rustle in the place whispers belong
or photos of petals near collapse.
Erase oranges of confusing taste, a face
wrinkled or in pain,
a map with waterless rivers or water
without a bend,
still in darkness. Here, where mystery 
beyond hope comes too near,
make a bright flight of leaves
descend, none to smear all our spotless
rivers. A map folds and unfolds, does not
bunch or wrinkle. Rainbows to last.
The First Endlessness of Eden.
This was the spot I was to start on, a leg
steps out of the lake,
a step falters instead into dashes that spread without prints onto the screaming bank.

The umbrella, in this case;
Earlier, the stool, the
Wooden pillars that hold up
    the roof. 
This guy, you realize,
Will dance with anything—
—He likes the idea. 
Then he picks up some lady’s discarded sandals,
Holds them next to his head like sea shells,
Donkey ears. 
Nothing,
         his body states,
Is safe from the dance of ideas!

Rachel Sherwood
1954-1979

"What can you say about a twenty-five-year-old girl who died?"
—Erich Segal, Love Story



The first time we talked was in the rooftop
cafeteria at Cal State Northridge.
Misplaced poets, we sat amidst a crop
of clean-cut freshmen while, round the college,
smog-smudged San Fernando Valley beckoned,
panoramic and bland. I’d just returned
from my debauched year up north—sad, drunken
sex at the baths, in dark parks. You still yearned
for St. David’s, your stint as a foreign
exchange student. In Wales, something fearless
woke you up: you drank, wrote, fucked. Now, stuck in
the suburbs, we talked poets, punk rock. This
was the late seventies, disco’s zenith.
We both wanted to look like Patti Smith. 
We both wanted to look like Patti Smith
on her Horses album: disheveled, pale,
thin, intense. You were scanning Meredith’s
“Modern Love” for British Lit. I thought stale
anyone before Sexton. You laughed, threw
back your head. I puffed a Marlboro Light.
In truth, you were too hearty, and I too
uptight, to do punk. I praised, as twilight
dimmed the gray valley, a poem you’d read
at the student reading: a pitcher cracks,
foreshadows a car crash. The skyline bled
behind you. I’d also read that night—racked
with stage fright, trembling uncontrollably.
You seemed at ease, more confident than me. 
You seemed at ease, more confident than me,
more independent. Lived on Amigo
Avenue with a roommate, a moody
science major; and your alter ego,
a tomcat named Baby Tubbs. Still at home,
I had no wheels. You drove a battered white
hatchback full of newspapers, beer cans, comb,
brush, books—half wastebasket, half purse. One night
early on, we split a fifth of scotch, spread
your tarot cards on the living room floor.
You predicted long life for me, then said
of yourself: “I might make twenty-five.” Your
roommate walked by, shot a look. Later, I
passed out beneath Lord Byron’s watchful eye. 
Passed out beneath Lord Byron’s watchful eye—
the poster tacked above your secondhand
couch—I dreamt I was falling down the side
of a mountain, a scarecrow, twisted and
limp, limbs ripped, bouncing from rock to rock. On
every wall an idol: Toulouse-Lautrec
cancan in kitchen, young Chatterton’s wan
figure over your desk. Shuffling the deck,
you asked the same question, drew the same black
card: Death. Together we consulted all
your oracles: Ouija board, zodiac,
I Ching, palm, a fickle Magic 8 Ball.
Hoping for more time, you inquired, believed
like a convict praying for a reprieve. 
Like a convict praying for a reprieve,
you were more alive than the complacent
suburbanites I despised. Drunk and peeved
at the world, I started an argument
that ended with you hurling a full Coors
at me as I fumed down your stairs. Four weeks
passed before we spoke, a rift I endured
by writing a poem about the freak-
ish night a black cloud followed us—we lit
candles, toasted oblivion. Battle
scarred, we entered the undergraduate
poetry contest at Northridge. Daniel
Halpern guest judged...or was it May Swenson?
After your death, I’d be happy you won. 
What can you say about a twenty-five-
year-old girl who died? That as a child she
loved horses. And dogs. And cats. That Monty
Python made her laugh. That she was alive
to the disruptions of her time. That she
liked Byron, Rod Stewart, Mozart, Waugh, Poe,
Keats, the Cars. That she lived on Amigo
and was my friend. That she once threw her keys
in anger; once threw a New Yorker, shout-
ing “I hate John Ashbery!” And that she
once, after a speed- and scotch-fueled orgy—
Some Girls blasting, her last boyfriend passed out
beside us—straddled, rode me like a horse.
Rachel, can I say this: your cunt felt coarse. 
After your death, I’d be happy you won
the contest—at least you had that. “Don’t turn
on me,” you pleaded. Losing wasn’t fun,
but I couldn’t begrudge you your prize. Burned
out from an abortion, a vicious bite—
a German shepherd lunged at your nose, slit
its tip—and a violent unrequit-
ed affair with your “Don J,” a closet
case obsessed with Kerouac, you spoke of
making a change. By then it was summer:
Blondie on the car radio, Fourth of
July, craving fireworks. I remember
headlights; reaching for the steering wheel, you.
Next thing I knew, I woke in ICU.    
Next thing I knew, I woke in ICU:
machines beeping around me, doctors and
nurses hovering in an eerie blue
light. Tube down my throat, I scrawled, with bruised hand,
your name, question mark. My sister was steered
in, wept to tell you were dead. The night they
moved me to a private room, you appeared,
pulsating white presence, in the hallway
outside my door. “I’m all right,” you said, “You
don’t have to worry about me.” I’d lie
there in traction for six weeks, almost two
decades ago, a ghost that fell from my
own scarecrow dream, numb to that deadly drop.
The first time we talked was on a rooftop.


^^EOP^^

Tiny bit of humanity,
Blessed with your mother’s face,   
And cursed with your father’s mind. 
I say cursed with your father’s mind,
Because you can lie so long and so quietly on your back,   
Playing with the dimpled big toe of your left foot,   
And looking away,
Through the ceiling of the room, and beyond.
Can it be that already you are thinking of being a poet? 
Why don’t you kick and howl,   
And make the neighbors talk about   
“That damned baby next door,”   
And make up your mind forthwith   
To grow up and be a banker
Or a politician or some other sort of go-getter   
Or—?—whatever you decide upon,   
Rid yourself of these incipient thoughts   
About being a poet. 
For poets no longer are makers of songs,   
Chanters of the gold and purple harvest,   
Sayers of the glories of earth and sky,   
Of the sweet pain of love
And the keen joy of living;
No longer dreamers of the essential dreams,   
And interpreters of the eternal truth,   
Through the eternal beauty.
Poets these days are unfortunate fellows.   
Baffled in trying to say old things in a new way   
Or new things in an old language,   
They talk abracadabra
In an unknown tongue,
Each one fashioning for himself
A wordy world of shadow problems,
And as a self-imagined Atlas,
Struggling under it with puny legs and arms,   
Groaning out incoherent complaints at his load. 
My son, this is no time nor place for a poet;   
Grow up and join the big, busy crowd   
That scrambles for what it thinks it wants   
Out of this old world which is—as it is—
And, probably, always will be. 
Take the advice of a father who knows:   
You cannot begin too young   
Not to be a poet.


^^EOP^^

Neither our vices nor our virtues   
further the poem. “They came up   
      and died
just like they do every year
      on the rocks.” 
      The poem
feeds upon thought, feeling, impulse,
      to breed    itself,
a spiritual urgency at the dark ladders leaping. 
This beauty is an inner persistence
      toward the source
striving against (within) down-rushet of the river,   
      a call we heard and answer
in the lateness of the world
      primordial bellowings
from which the youngest world might spring, 
salmon not in the well where the   
      hazelnut falls
but at the falls battling, inarticulate,   
      blindly making it. 
This is one picture apt for the mind. 
A second: a moose painted by Stubbs,
where last year’s extravagant antlers   
      lie on the ground.
The forlorn moosey-faced poem wears   
      new antler-buds,
      the same, 
“a little heavy, a little contrived”, 
his only beauty to be   
      all moose.

the others have nothing.

Ventura because she was hungry and because
She was curious—but more because she was curious—
Took the dare, a kiss for a pomegranate.
Everyone gathered, her friends and his. Everyone
Watched: the boys, the girls, the pigs and the chickens,
And more. Moving to the front were the children
She and Clemente would one day have,
And the children of those children, too,
Gathered and loud with everyone and everything else,
Loud as the pigs and fast as the chickens
Though she could not see them.
Still, they crowded her, and she could feel
Their anxious breathing.
This boy Clemente whom she would kiss
She would have kissed even without the pomegranate,
Though she could not say it
And was glad of this game. He suited her,
She thought. He had a strong face.
He felt what she felt. She could see him look around
But not at their friends. She could see him
Feel the shiver of the children they would have:
Their son Margarito, his two sisters
Both of whom would become nuns
If just to pray enough to take care of him,
This boy so serious he would seem like a stranger
In their arms, serious enough by himself
To make up for Clemente and Ventura
And for all the laughter
They themselves would feel,
This curious child who, as an old man
Would never trust a doctor for anything.
And his serious wife to come, Refugio,
And her sisters, Matilde and Consuelo as well,
All the people who would follow this kiss,
So many of them, and their children, too,
Everyone stood there, arms up, everyone watching,
So much noise in this moment,
This quick lending of herself
To his cheek, the way Ventura would later kiss
All these impatient children of theirs. The kiss
Seemed so small, but was filled with itself.
This small moment of affection she gave this boy
The quarter-second that it took:
There they all stood, waiting with the crowd
Egging them on, hefting the pomegranate
And pushing them toward each other.
Clemente and Ventura in that quarter-second lived
Their lives, a quarter-second not finished yet.

Snapping turtles in the pond eat bass, sunfish,
and frogs. They do us no harm when we swim.
But early this spring two Canada geese
lingered, then built a nest. What I’d
heard of, our neighbor feared: goslings,
as they paddle about, grabbed from below
by a snapper, pulled down to drown.
                                                                   So he stuck
hunks of fat on huge, wire-leadered hooks
attached to plastic milk-bottle buoys.
The first week he caught three turtles
and still there are more: sometimes he finds
the bottles dragged ashore, the wire
wrapped several times around a pine trunk
and the steel hook wrenched straight as a pin.

My embarrassment at his nakedness,   
at the pool’s edge,
and my wife, with his,
standing, watching— 
this was a freedom   
not given me who am   
more naked,
less contained 
by my own white flesh
and the ability   
to take quietly   
what comes to me. 
The sense of myself   
separate, grew
a white mirror
in the quiet water 
he breaks with his hands   
and feet, kicking,
pulls up to land
on the edge by the feet 
of these women   
who must know   
that for each
man is a speech 
describes him, makes
the day grow white
and sure, a quietness of water   
in the mind, 
lets hang, descriptive   
as a risk, something
for which he cannot find   
a means or time.


^^EOP^^

At this hour the soul floats weightlessly
through the city streets, speechless and invisible,
astonished by the smoky blend of grays and golds
seeping out of the air, the dark half-tones 
of dusk suddenly filling the urban sky
while the body sits listlessly by the window
sullen and heavy, too exhausted to move,
too weary to stand up or to lie down. 
At this hour the soul is like a yellow wing
slipping through the treetops, a little ecstatic
cloud hovering over the sidewalks, calling out
to the approaching night, “Amaze me, amaze me,” 
while the body sits glumly by the window
listening to the clear summons of the dead
transparent as glass, clairvoyant as crystal.
Some nights it is almost ready to join them. 
Oh, this is a strange, unlikely tethering,
a furious grafting of the quick and the slow:
when the soul flies up, the body sinks down
and all night—locked in the same cramped room— 
they go on quarreling, stubbornly threatening
to leave each other, wordlessly filling the air
with the sound of a low internal burning.
How long can this bewildering marriage last? 
At midnight the soul dreams of a small fire
of stars flaming on the other side of the sky,
but the body stares into an empty night sheen,
a hollow-eyed darkness. Poor luckless angels, 
feverish old loves: don’t separate yet.
Let what rises live with what descends.

More nice than wise.



XI Mon. January [1733] hath xxxi days.     Old Batchelor would have a Wife that’s wise,    Fair, rich, and young, a Maiden for his Bed;    Not proud, nor churlish, but of faultless size;    A Country Houswife in the City bred. He’s a nice Fool, and long in vain hath staid; He should bespeak her, there’s none ready made.  XII Mon. February hath xxviii days.              N. N. of B---s County, pray don’t be angry with                                poor Richard.   Each Age of Men new Fashions doth invent;        Things which are old, young Men do not esteem: What pleas’d our Fathers, doth not us content;         What flourish’d then, we out of fashion deem:                 And that’s the reason, as I understand,                 Why Prodigus did fell his Father’s Land.  I Mon. March hath xxxi days.     My Love and I for Kisses play’d,    She would keep stakes, I was content,    But when I won she would be paid;    This made me ask her what she meant: Quoth she, since you are in this wrangling vein, Here take your Kisses, give me mine again.  II Mon. April hath xxx days.  Kind Katharine to her husband kiss’d these words, “ Mine own sweet Will, how dearly I love thee! If true (quoth Will) the World no such affords. And that its true I durst his warrant be;    For ne’er heard I of Woman good or ill,    But always loved best, her own sweet Will.  III Mon. May hath xxxi days.  Mirth pleaseth some, to others ’tis offence, Some commend plain conceit, some profound sense; Some wish a witty Jest, some dislike that, And most would have themselves they know not what.    Then he that would please all, and himself too,    Takes more in hand than he is like to do.  IV Mon. June hath xxx days.  Observe the daily circle of the sun, And the short year of each revolving moon: By them thou shalt foresee the following day, Nor shall a starry night thy hopes betray. When first the moon appears, if then she shrouds Her silver crescent, tip’d with sable clouds, Conclude she bodes a tempest on the main, And brews for fields impetuous floods of rain.  V Mon. July hath xxxi days.  Ev’n while the reaper fills his greedy hands, And binds the golden sheafs in brittle bands: Oft have I seen a sudden storm arise From all the warring winds that sweep the skies: And oft whole sheets descend of slucy rain, Suck’d by the spungy clouds from oft the main; The lofty skies at once come pouring down, The promis’d crop and golden labours drown.  VI Mon. August hath xxxi days.  For us thro’ 12 bright signs Apollo guides The year, and earth in sev’ral climes divides. Five girdles bind the skies, the torrid zone Glows with the passing and repassing sun. Far on the right and left, th’extreams of heav’n, To frosts and snows and bitter blasts are giv’n. Betwixt the midst and these, the Gods assign’d Two habitable seats for humane kind.  VII Mon. September hath xxx days.  Death is a Fisherman, the world we see His Fish-pond is, and we the Fishes be: His Net some general Sickness; howe’er he Is not so kind as other Fishers be; For if they take one of the smaller Fry, They throw him in again, he shall not die: But Death is sure to kill all he can get, And all is Fish with him that comes to Net.  VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days.      Time was my spouse and I could not agree, Striving about superiority: The text which saith that man and wife are one, Was the chief argument we stood upon: She held, they both one woman should become; I held they should be man, and both but one. Thus we contended daily, but the strife Could not be ended, till both were one Wife.  IX Mon. November hath xxx days.  My neighbour H—-y by his pleasing tongue, Hath won a Girl that’s rich, wise, fair and young, The Match (he saith) is half concluded, he Indeed is wondrous willing; but not she. And reason good, for he has run thro’all Almost the story of the Prodigal; Yet swears he never with the hogs did dine; That’s true, for none would trust him with their swine.  X Mon. December hath xxxi days.  She that will eat her breakfast in her bed, And spend the morn in dressing of her head, And sit at dinner like a maiden bride, And talk of nothing all day but of pride; God in his mercy may do much to save her, But what a case is he in that shall have her.

There is no widening distance at the shore—
The sea revolving slowly from the piers—
But the one border of our take-off roar
And we are mounted on the hemispheres. 
Above the waning moon whose almanac
We wait to finish continents away,
The Northern stars already call us back,
And silence folds like maps on all we say. 
Under the sky, a stadium tensed to cry
The ringside savage thrumming of the fights,
We watch our engines, taut and trained for sky,
Arranged on fields of concrete flowered with lights. 
Day after day we fondle and repeat
A jeweler’s adjustment on a screw;
Or wander past the bulletins to meet
And wander back to watch the sky be blue. 
Somehow we see ourselves in photographs
Held in our hands to show us back our pride
When, aging, we recall in epitaphs
The faces just behind and to each side. 
The nights keep perfect silence. In the dark
You feel the faces soften into sleep,
Or tense upon the fraught and falling arc
Of fear a boy had buried not too deep. 
Finally we stand by and consciously
Measure the double sense of all our talk,
And, everyman his dramatist, anxiously
Corrects his role, his gesture, and his walk.

Jamaica, 1960



Ignoring the local reliquiae—
neoclassical arches in ruin,
courtyards, their fountains toppled,  prados flourishing in prickle-weed, esplanades
no longer level enough to collect rainwater,
much less respect for the Imperio de España  
tarnished by an islander’s mock-British accent—
two fisherman returned at sundown.
Antiquaries themselves, these fishermen 
schooled in the currents, the tide,
the tunneled limestone of the coral reefs,
preferred the graceful curves of the £. 
At the landing, five children, single file,
marched away the birds like soldiers,
the learned lyrics escaping their lips:  Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves.

Hanging from the beam,       Slowly swaying (such the law), Gaunt the shadow on your green,       Shenandoah! The cut is on the crown       (Lo, John Brown), And the stabs shall heal no more.

Seeing in crowded restaurants the one you love
You wave at the door, tall girl in imperious fur,
And make for him, bumping waiters, dropping a glove,
Arriving soft with affectionate slur.
As ladies half-turn, gazing, and men appraise
You heap the linen with purse, scarf, cigarettes, lighter,
Laughing some instantaneous droll phrase.
As if sudden sun came out, the table is brighter. 
All moods: at a party everybody’s delight;
Intent while brown curls shadow the serious page;
When people are stuffy (more correct than right)
The stamp and turn on heel of a little girl’s rage.
But woman mostly, as winter moonlight sees,
Impetuous midnight, and the dune’s dark trees.

Dear Folks, 
(Smile)
Enclosed, is the Ordinary River.
It is called “That Devil,”
In whose name the locals are baptized.
Finally that river twists
Like a hurt thing—
They say it’s nothing.
It has become a new road
In a naked place.
Then, I am nothing
And it is that dream
I dreamed I dreamed. 
               Sincerely,  
                              ~  
               Hello, 
I have just passed “Doubt,”
It is near “Milk Teeth,”
And “Nothing,” and “Falling Out.”
There are flowers and evidence
Of ambiguous winds.
“Doubt” is like a man
Walking in his sleep, seriously.
Offhand, it reminds me
Of a Jamesian novel
With the motives, the motives, the motives. 
               Have Mercy,  
                              ~  
               Say, 
To get to Innocence,
You take the narrow trail
From Deep.
You squeeze into the mountain’s waves.
If you meet savage rock,
It is the wrong way.
Turn left. . .
There, then, in our hearts’
Honeymoon, lay I. 
               Queequeg  
                              ~  
               J.P., 
Today is Friday.
We are still on the hill
Called Spirit of the Wind
But we are down real low
Like new flame
Just to be close. 
               Dad  
                              ~  
               Baby G., 
Sunday,
And what you are probably babbling
I seem to see,
(I.e.) at 60 mph
This is the alfalfa field
Of my heart.
There is no museum here,
And in a convertible,
Where birds can sing,
Anything is possible. 
               Dad  
                              ~  
               Milton, 
There is a mountain called Can
She is blind with snow
But all seers are blind
What we need
In the morning when we always see her
And are always reborn
Is a magnificent horn
And the strangely uneven voice
Of her life 
               Thanks,  
                              ~  
               Bill, 
I checked this out. . .
You know that ridge up there
Is north, because you know
For no reason (except this).
A great wind blows.
Behind it, the stars come out
Virtually human.
And here you are, apparently
Crude, like the sound
Of a breaking string
That seems to come from the sky. 
               So Long,

From embarrassment, I made statements.
My icons—tight caves and mouths—stuck together
briefly like dry lips, like a lover’s insults.
The fact is they were ugly to all of us.
I said, How painstakingly personal!
Here are the words for this,
Relentless as insects! I was hysterical. 
Every tone became artful,
the worst urges nuzzling like housepets
for someone to feel them, each real subject
demanding more real context for remarks.
Then abstractions insinuating their sharp edges,
asking to pry open privacies
alone in the bathroom at bedtime
then with strangers in elevators, at stop signs.
Even then, I knew you’d shun them,
because who would choose such intrusions? 
I learned to love this isolation
as a woman who appears to listen.
All night I’d talk about my life
anticipating her dramatic relief,
believing her affectionate gestures filled in
what wasn’t spoken. At those times
she seemed so genuine and friendly,
a voice from inside my own body
describing my shameless surrender
as our first kiss, perfect as gravity.


^^EOP^^

Now that I have cooled to you
Let there be gold of tarnished masonry,
Temples soothed by the sun to ruin   
That sleep utterly.
Give me hand for the dances,            
Ripples at Philae, in and out,         
And lips, my Lesbian,         
Wall flowers that once were flame.          
Your hair is my Carthage         
And my arms the bow,         
And our words arrows         
To shoot the stars         
Who from that misty sea         
Swarm to destroy us.          
But you there beside me—         
Oh how shall I defy you,         
Who wound me in the night         
With breasts shining         
Like Venus and like Mars?         
The night that is shouting Jason         
When the loud eaves rattle         
As with waves above me         
Blue at the prow of my desire.

Of like importance is the posture too, In which the genial feat of Love we do: For as the females of the four foot kind, Receive the leapings of their Males behind; So the good Wives, with loins uplifted high, And leaning on their hands the fruitful stroke may try: For in that posture will they best conceive: Not when supinely laid they frisk and heave; For active motions only break the blow, And more of Strumpets than of Wives they show; When answering stroke with stroke, the mingled liquors flow. Endearments eager, and too brisk a bound, Throws off the Plow-share from the furrow’d ground. But common Harlots in conjunction heave, Because ’tis less their business to conceive Than to delight, and to provoke the deed; A trick which honest Wives but little need.

I  Though I sing high, and chaunt above her, Praising my girl, It were not right To reckon her the poorer lover;    She does not love me less For her royal, jewelled speechlessness, She is the sapphire, she the light, The music in the pearl.   II  Not from pert birds we learn the spring-tide    From open sky.    What speaks to us Closer than far distances that hide In woods, what is more dear Than a cherry-bough, bees feeding near In the soft, proffered blooms? Lo, I Am fed and honoured thus.   III  She has the star’s own pulse; its throbbing    Is a quick light. She is a dove My soul draws to its breast; her sobbing    Is for the warm dark there! In the heat of her wings I would not care My close-housed bird should take her flight    To magnify our love.

I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall

as it meets the Columbia, then upstream, until it arrives

I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall after   
that salmon leaps into the night air above the water, throws   
a lightning bolt at the brush near my feet, and starts the fire   
which will lead all of the lost Indians home. I am told   
by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall   
after we Indians have gathered around the fire with that salmon   
who has three stories it must tell before sunrise: one story will teach us   
how to pray; another story will make us laugh for hours;   
the third story will give us reason to dance. I am told by many   
of you that I must forgive and so I shall when I am dancing

Unreasonable lenses refract the

Prais’d be Diana’s fair and harmless light; Prais’d be the dews wherewith she moists the ground; Prais’d be her beams, the glory of the night; Prais’d be her power by which all powers abound.  Prais’d be her nymphs with whom she decks the woods, Prais’d be her knights in whom true honour lives; Prais’d be that force by which she moves the floods; Let that Diana shine which all these gives.  In heaven queen she is among the spheres; In aye she mistress-like makes all things pure; Eternity in her oft change she bears; She beauty is; by her the fair endure.  Time wears her not: she doth his chariot guide; Mortality below her orb is plac’d; By her the virtue of the stars down slide; In her is virtue’s perfect image cast.           A knowledge pure it is her worth to know:          With Circes let them dwell that think not so.

for Yehuda Amichai



1. 
Snow clouds shadow the bay, on the ice the odd fallen gull.
I try to keep my friend from dying by remembering
his childhood of praise to God, who needs us all. Würzburg:
the grownups are inside saying prayers for the dead,
the children are sent out to play—their laughter
more sacred than prayer. After dark his father
blesses and kisses him Güttenacht. He wakes
to go to school with children who stayed behind
and were murdered before promotion. 
Now his wife lies beside him.
He may die with her head on his pillow.
He sings in his sleep:
“Her breasts are white sheep that appear on the mountain,
her belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.”
Awake, he says, as if telling me a secret:
“When metaphor and reality come together, death occurs.”
His life is a light, fresh snow blowing across the bay.   2. 
A year later in Jerusalem, he carries a fallen soldier
on his back, himself. The text for the day begins:
“He slew a lion in the pit in a time of snow”
Seconds, minutes, hours are flesh,
he tells me he is being cut to pieces—
if they had not made him turn in his rifle …
He sees I can not bear more of that.
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding
of hands in sleep and we drink to life.
Chilled in desert heat, what keeps him alive:
soldiers—his wife, his son and daughter,
perhaps the ashes of a girl he loved in childhood.
Outside their window
a Sun Bird and Dead Sea Sparrow fly
from everlasting to everlasting.
Later he covers my head with his hands, blessing me,
later unable to walk alone he holds onto my hand
with so much strength he comforts me.

Over a dock railing, I watch the minnows, thousands, swirl   
themselves, each a minuscule muscle, but also, without the   
way to create current, making of their unison (turning, re-
                                                                      infolding,
entering and exiting their own unison in unison) making of themselves a   
visual current, one that cannot freight or sway by   
minutest fractions the water’s downdrafts and upswirls, the   
dockside cycles of finally-arriving boat-wakes, there where   
they hit deeper resistance, water that seems to burst into   
itself (it has those layers), a real current though mostly   
invisible sending into the visible (minnows) arrowing
                                    motion that forces change—
this is freedom. This is the force of faith. Nobody gets   
what they want. Never again are you the same. The longing
is to be pure. What you get is to be changed. More and more by
each glistening minute, through which infinity threads itself,   
also oblivion, of course, the aftershocks of something   
at sea. Here, hands full of sand, letting it sift through   
in the wind, I look in and say take this, this is   
what I have saved, take this, hurry. And if I listen   
now? Listen, I was not saying anything. It was only   
something I did. I could not choose words. I am free to go.   
I cannot of course come back. Not to this. Never.   
It is a ghost posed on my lips. Here: never.

On a damp June Saturday, as colorless
As cellar stone, the working classes from
Dun Laoghaire spread their picnic blankets, tins,
And soda bread along the coastal cliffs.
Two hundred feet below, the ocean knocks
Debris and timber on the rock, and near
The precipice, I watch a father swing
His daughter out, as though to loose her on
That long descent, past rookeries of gulls
As intricate as mosques, through casual
Alliances of mist and fog, and toward
The cowlicked Irish Sea, as fathomless
And bitter as their history. With each
Return, the young girl cries out her delight,
Then girds once more against the peril there:
As though she knows no child is desired wholly;
That there is not a mother, dreading birth,
Who does not sometime curse her recklessness,
Nor father, yoked to press or forklift truck,
Who has not brooded on the chance of some
Untimely accident. Pray God that such
Black thoughts do not now reach like beggar’s mitts
Into his mind, or better pray that he
Has vowed, despite them all, not to permit
His difficult and gnarled grip to give.

Your head is still
restless, rolling
east and west.
That body in you
insisting on living
is the old hawk
for whom the world
darkens.
If I am not
with you when you die,
that is just. 
It is all right.
That part of you cleaned
my bones more
than once. But I
will meet you
in the young hawk
whom I see
inside both
you and me; he
will guide
you to the Lord of Night,
who will give you
the tenderness
you wanted here.

Those intervals
between the day’s
five calls to prayer 
the women of the house
pulling thick threads
through vegetables 
rosaries of ginger
of rustling peppers
in autumn drying for winter 
in those intervals this rug
part of Grandma’s dowry
folded 
so the Devil’s shadow
would not desecrate
Mecca scarlet-woven 
with minarets of gold
but then the sunset
call to prayer 
the servants
their straw mats unrolled
praying or in the garden 
in summer on grass
the children wanting
the prayers to end 
the women’s foreheads
touching Abraham’s
silk stone of sacrifice 
black stone descended
from Heaven
the pilgrims in white circling it 
this year my grandmother
also a pilgrim
in Mecca she weeps 
as the stone is unveiled
she weeps holding on
to the pillars

Our Father who art in heaven, I am drunk.
Again. Red wine. For which I offer thanks.
I ought to start with praise, but praise
comes hard to me. I stutter. Did I tell you
about the woman whom I taught, in bed,
this prayer? It starts with praise; the simple form
keeps things in order. I hear from her sometimes.
Do you? And after love, when I was hungry,
I said, Make me something to eat. She yelled, Poof! You’re a casserole!—and laughed so hard
she fell out of the bed. Take care of her. 
Next, confession—the dreary part. At night
deer drift from the dark woods and eat my garden.
They’re like enormous rats on stilts except,
of course, they’re beautiful. But why? What makes
them beautiful? I haven’t shot one yet.
I might. When I was twelve, I’d ride my bike
out to the dump and shoot the rats. It’s hard
to kill your rats, our Father. You have to use
a hollow point and hit them solidly.
A leg is not enough. The rat won’t pause. Yeep! Yeep! it screams, and scrabbles, three-legged, back
into the trash, and I would feel a little bad
to kill something that wants to live
more savagely than I do, even if
it’s just a rat. My garden’s vanishing.
Perhaps I’ll merely plant more beans, though that
might mean more beautiful and hungry deer.
Who knows?
                I’m sorry for the times I’ve driven
home past a black, enormous, twilight ridge.
Crested with mist, it looked like a giant wave
about to break and sweep across the valley,
and in my loneliness and fear I’ve thought, O let it come and wash the whole world clean.
Forgive me. This is my favorite sin: despair—
whose love I celebrate with wine and prayer. 
Our Father, thank you for all the birds and trees,
that nature stuff. I’m grateful for good health,
food, air, some laughs, and all the other things
I’m grateful that I’ve never had to do
without. I have confused myself. I’m glad
there’s not a rattrap large enough for deer.
While at the zoo last week, I sat and wept
when I saw one elephant insert his trunk
into another’s ass, pull out a lump,
and whip it back and forth impatiently
to free the goodies hidden in the lump.
I could have let it mean most anything,
but I was stunned again at just how little
we ask for in our lives. Don’t look! Don’t look!
Two young nuns tried to herd their giggling
schoolkids away. Line up, they called. Let’s go
and watch the monkeys in the monkey house.

...this insignificant interval between death and dying.

One cannot accept or refuse, O death, emptiness, air, sun.



The "I" is the miracle of the "You." 
   "This follows from a certain logic," he said: "the 'I' to designate the 'You,' the 'You' to justify the 'I,' and 'He' for disappearing." 
   There is no present. There is a past haunted by the future and a future tormented by the past.
   The present is the time of writing, both obsessed with and cut off from an out-of-time brimming with life.  
                              (Now that all is silent within me, will I, who have
                         hardly known how to talk to myself, still be able to
                         speak? I almost cannot hear myself any more. On this
                         'almost' I shall rest my words or, rather, what stub-
                         bornly still wants to be words—though they be deaf
                         to the call of the world—an take entire charge of
                         them. Expressing nothing, they will express me all the

The limit of the song is this
prelude to a journey to
the outer islands, the generative
sentence, waltz project, forms,
qualities, suns, moons, rings,
an inside-outside then
an outside-inside shaped
with her colored clays. The days
yet propse themselves
as self-evident, everything there
everything here
and you are reading
in a way natural to theatre
a set of instructions
that alters itself automatically
as you proceed west
from death to friendliness, the two
topics upon which you are allowed
to meditate
under the first broad drops
of rain. The planes
will be piloted by ancestors
who have come back to life.
Why the delay.

A B H O R E N C E S
November 13, 1984



The show did not start off
auspiciously, the contestants
were nervous and kept fiddling
with the wires attached
to their privates, the men
being especially anxious
over the question of balls.
The women were more querulous. 
The first question, a medical subject,
was why had the anti-abortionists
not mentioned, let alone commented on,
the Baboon Heart transplant?
One terrified contestant guessed
it was because the moral majority’s
nervous concern with evolution
precluded their bringing it up.
That hopeful contestant’s face
reflected the malicious light
in the eyes of the host who
immediately threw the switch 
A powerful surge shot through
the wires and both sexes screamed
and writhed, to the delight of
the vast viewership, estimated
at 100 million, all of whom,
presumably, were delighted
not to be on the show,
because not one in a million
knew the answer.

The skin ripples over my body like moon-wooed water,
rearing to escape me. Where could it find another
animal as naked as the one it hates to cover?
Once it told me what was happening outside,
who was attacking, who caressing, and what the air
was doing to feed or freeze me. Now I wake up
dark at night, in a textureless ocean of ignorance,
or fruit bites back and water bruises like a stone.
It’s jealousy, because I look for other tools to know
with, and other armor, better girded to my wish.
So let it lie, turn off the clues or try to leave:
sewn on me seamless like those painful shirts
the body-hating saints wore, the sheath of hell
is pierced to my darkness nonetheless: what traitors
labor in my face, what hints they smuggle through
its arching guard! But even in the night it jails,
with nothing but its lies and silences to feed upon,
the jail itself can make a scenery, sing prison songs,
and set off fireworks to praise a homemade day.

Though the road turn at last   
to death’s ordinary door,   
and we knock there, ready   
to enter and it opens
easily for us,
                     yet
all the long journey
we shall have gone in chains,   
fed on knowledge-apples   
acrid and riddled with grubs. 
We taste other food that life,   
like a charitable farm-girl,   
holds out to us as we pass—
but our mouths are puckered,   
a taint of ash on the tongue. 
It’s not joy that we’ve lost—
wildfire, it flares
in dark or shine as it will.
What’s gone
is common happiness,
plain bread we could eat
with the old apple of knowledge. 
That old one—it griped us sometimes,   
but it was firm, tart,   
sometimes delectable ... 
The ashen apple of these days
grew from poisoned soil. We are prisoners   
and must eat
our ration. All the long road
in chains, even if, after all,
we come to
death’s ordinary door, with time
smiling its ordinary
long-ago smile.


^^EOP^^

The animals are leaving
the safety of the trees 
Light sensors respond
to the footfall of every guest 
To retard the growth of algae 
The fishes must be moved
from the window 
Stiller than water she lies
As in a glass dress 
As if all life might come to its end
within the radius of her bed 
Beyond the reef of trees a beach cannot be seen
the bay itself barely breathing 
In the other wing of the house
a small boat awaits elucidation


^^EOP^^

Three crates of Private Eye Lettuce,
the name and drawing of a detective
with magnifying glass on the sides
of the crates of lettuce,
form a great cross in man’s imagination
and his desire to name   
the objects of this world.
I think I’ll call this place Golgotha
and have some salad for dinner.

The cheap dropped ceiling 
     jumped like a pot-lid boiling when our upstairs neighbor 
   chased his girl that winter. 
        Falling out of 
summer’s skimpy tops 
  she’d want our phone. Her plush lips creased. Not exactly blonde, 
    but luteous, we thought, 
             pleased the right word 
was there for that shade 
    of slightly slutty mermaid. Wincing, we’d hear him punch 
   along the floor on crutch- 
         es, a giant 
bat trying to mince 
     a mayfly. Sex and Violence you called them; Blondie with 
     Dagwood on crystal meth, 
         I’d tell our friends 
over dinners stewed 
    in noise. Even his truck cowed. Black, smoked glass, outsized wheels 
    flaunted like chrome knuckles 
          we shrank from, ducked, 
afraid we’d find her 
     later, knocking at our door. Some nights we waited through 
   like captured prey. To you 
         I’d turn in bed, 
saying the furtive
     words against your back, I love ... You’d stroke my hair, or hip, 
     all our years the same flip 
           crack, I do, too.

I turn to my Rand McNally Atlas.
Europe appears right after the Map of the World.
All of Italy can be seen page 9.
Half of Chile page 29.
I take out my ruler.
In global perspective Italy
amounts to less than half an inch.
Chile measures more than an inch and a quarter
of an inch.
Approximately
Chile is as long as China
is wide:
Back to the Atlas:
Chunk of China page 17.
All of France page 5: As we say in New York:
Who do France and Italy know
at Rand McNally?

I see the four mountains in Chile higher
than any mountain of North America.
I see Ojos del Salado the highest.
I see Chile unequivocal as crystal thread.
I see the Atacama Desert dry in Chile more than the rest
of the world is dry.
I see Chile dissolving into water.
I do not see what keeps the blue land of Chile
out of blue water.
I do not see the hand of Pablo Neruda on the blue land.

that is not black

Blood rising under the Andes and above
the Andes blood
spilling down the rock
corrupted by the amorality
of so much space
that leaves such little trace of blood
rising to the irritated skin the face
of the confession far
from home: 
I confess I did not resist interrogation.
I confess that by the next day I was no longer sure
of my identity.
I confess I knew the hunger.
I confess I saw the guns.
I confess I was afraid.
I confess I did not die.

Who will that feed?

Early morning now and I remember corriendo a la madrugada from a different
English poem,
I remember from the difficulties of the talk
an argument
athwart the wine the dinner and the dancing
meant to welcome you 
you did not understand the commonplace expression
of my heart:  the truth is in the life
la verdad de la vida

a liquid line beneath the skin
and b where the blue tiles meet
body and the body’s bridge
a seeming road here, endless 
rain pearling light
chamber after chamber
of dust-weighted air
the project of seeing things
so to speak, or things seen 
namely a hand, namely
the logic of the hand
holding a bell or clouded lens
the vase perched impossibly near the edge
obscuring the metal tines. 
She said “perhaps” then it echoed.
I stood there torn
felt hat in hand
wondering what I had done
to cause this dizziness 
“you must learn to live with.”
It reveals no identifiable source
(not anyway the same as a forest floor).
A vagrant march time, car
passes silently, arm rests at his side 
holding a bell or ground lens
where c stands for inessential night –
how that body would
move vs how it actually does –
too abstract &/or not abstract enough 
but a closed curve in either case
she might repeat
indicating the shallow eaves
nothing but coats and scarves below the window
his-her face canted to the left 
nothing imagined or imaginable
dark and nothing actually begun
so that the color becomes exactly as it was
in the miniuscule word for it
scribbled beside an arrow 
on the far wall
perfectly how else continuous with memory.
There are pomegranates on the table
though they have been placed there
salt, pepper, books and schedules 
all sharing the same error
and measure of inattention.
What she says rolls forward.
I shouted toward motion, other gestured,
child laughs, sky, 
traffic, photograph. I
gave a real pain, expelled
breath, decided. Both arms in thought,
mirror otherwise, abandoned
structures mostly, the glass 
door with its inscription lay open
before us, nothing to fear.


^^EOP^^

Though each single life occurs
in a series of occasions
         striking only by what
blurry context
         precedes them
               So come to know
               what I should have wanted
               to say—from 

^^EOP^^

The Props assist the House
Until the House is built
And then the Props withdraw
And adequate, erect,
The House support itself
And cease to recollect
The Augur and the Carpenter –
Just such a retrospect
Hath the perfected Life –
A Past of Plank and Nail
And slowness – then the scaffolds drop
Affirming it a Soul –

There is a land of pure delight    Where saints immortal reign; Infinite day excludes the night,    And pleasures banish pain.  There everlasting spring abides,    And never-withering flowers; Death like a narrow sea divides    This heavenly land from ours.  Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood    Stand dressed in living green: So to the Jews old Canaan stood,    While Jordan rolled between.  But timorous mortals start and shrink    To cross this narrow sea, And linger shivering on the brink,    And fear to launch away.  Oh could we make our doubts remove,    These gloomy doubts that rise, And see the Canaan that we love,    With unbeclouded eyes;  Could we but climb where Moses stood    And view the landscape o’er, Not Jordan’s stream, nor death’s cold flood,    Should fright us from the shore.


^^EOP^^

The love we’ve defined for ourselves
in privacy, in suffering,
keeps both of us lonely as a fist,
but does intimacy mean a happy ending?
I’m afraid of marriage.
Driving past them at night, the shadows
on a drawn curtain hide terrible lives:
a father stuck in a job, his daughter
opening her blouse to strangers. 
And your hands, for example,
like a warm liquid on my face
don’t evaporate as you take them away.
Nor are our betrayals silent,
although we listen only in passing.
We’re learning how to walk unlit streets,
to see threats instead of trees,
the right answer to a teenager
opening his knife. The answer is yes.
Always we couldn’t do otherwise.

It's hard to get anywhere in Utah without going through Provo.
I can't tell you the number of times
I went there as a teenager, the number
Of times I drove into town in the early
Afternoon, hungry, and had to look around
For a place to eat. You don't have to starve
In Provo but you eat at your own risk.
At no risk. I would never have gone to Provo
On my own. I went accompanied—
For reasons almost too trivial—or personal—to mention.  
There are moments when you simply must get into the car and drive
And from Salt Lake there are only a few ways to go,
Toward the Great Salt Lake or toward the canyons and to get
To Zion or Moab you had to pass through Provo.  
I remember the population because it went
With the number of miles from outskirt to outskirt,
45 miles, 45,000 people, 45 minutes
(Keeping to the speed limit)
$45 to spend on a suit at a 45% discount... 
There was nothing Provo's department store did not carry,
Including pearl handled Colt 45's,
But for a wider selection of fire arms, rifles
With narrowing focal points, with greater precision over vast distances,
You were better off
Next door.  
O I guess it wasn't that different from entering
A thousand other American towns, but this one
Made my flesh crawl. I wanted to howl. 
The men walked with their hands deep in their pockets.
The women were afraid to lift their eyes.
It was as if something terrible had happened
Or was about to happen.  
I'm not saying you have to love what you do
In this life, but it isn't nice to practice
The silent treatment on strangers in the desert,
Strangers who would have to be wondering
Where the other 44,990 people were, since
Other than the one drowning potatoes in burning oil 
Beside the grill in the luncheonette
And the one behind the register,
And the three grim-faced, parchment-skinned
Jack Mormons hunkered over cups,
And the handful of impassive faces
Placed against the windows
Of one-story cinder-block houses, 
There was no one in Provo beyond the jackrabbits—
Glimpsed in abundance en route—
Who vanished as we crossed the town line,
And drove past the population sign. 
Or was it a warning in disguise?  
There was something eerie in the air, 
An absence I could not identify.  
An immense single-pump gas station,
Shimmering like a mirage in the heat,
Took up a good part of the main drag.
I pull in. Step into the heat stunned.
The car is too hot to touch.
I needed gas but didn't want to get it there.
It meant digging up the attendant. 
You know the lights in hospital corridors,
Those are the lights in the gas station in Provo.
They're the kind of lights that show up whatever's wrong with a face;
The kind of lights that make something wrong when there's nothing
    wrong.
    
When I got there, I was afraid. It's hard
To put my finger on the precise reason why.
It's not as though something ominous rose
From the sidewalks or Hell's Angels cycles
Were parked outside the luncheonette.
Nothing like that. 
Nor can I say why, even though there was almost
No one on the street, I felt watched. 
While I slept fitfully in the tilt-back bucket seats,
Someone scribbled obscenities on the headlights. 
I felt drawn by destiny to this nadir.  
You don't want to provoke anyone in Provo.
It's that kind of place, that kind of absence— 
The desert flattens out, the plants
Draw in their antennae. 
Provo is not where you can hope to find
Boon companions. It's against the law
To serve liquor in the bar
And no one in the luncheonette looks up
When you walk in. 
These are the fallen,
Sunk in ashes, adrift
In the smoke of unreason. 
They have masturbated without shame.
They have coveted, envied.
They have pocketed the tithe. 
It's hard to put it into words: Provo.
It's more like a place without a name,
A desert stopover with the semblance of a town. 
Provo is a place where there is no reason to be.
A province that would never grow up to be a suburb,
Like the backwaters where they exiled
Ovid and Pascal.
Only there is no water—
Just landscape shorn of green and tawny desert colors.
Burned skyline.
Hills like craggy impenetrable fortresses.
The rain gutters hiss in the dryness.
There's a menacing blue tint on the rims
Of impinging mountains.


^^EOP^^

It starts in sadness and bewilderment,   
The self-reflexive iconography   
Of late adolescence, and a moment 
When the world dissolves into a fable   
Of an alternative geography   
Beyond the threshold of the visible. 
And the heart is a kind of mute witness,   
Abandoning everything for the sake   
Of an unimaginable goodness 
Making its way across the crowded stage
Of what might have been, leaving in its wake   
The anxiety of an empty page. 
Thought abhors a vacuum. Out of it came   
A partially recognizable shape
Stumbling across a wilderness, whose name, 
Obscure at first, was sooner or later   
Sure to be revealed, and a landscape   
Of imaginary rocks and water 
And the dull pastels of the dimly lit   
Interior of a gymnasium.   
Is art the mirror of its opposite, 
Or is the world itself a mimesis?   
This afternoon at the symposium   
Someone tried to resurrect the thesis 
That a poem is a deflected sigh.   
And I remembered a day on a beach   
Thirty-five years ago, in mid-July, 
The summer before I left for college,   
With the future hanging just out of reach   
And constantly receding, like the edge 
Of the water floating across the sand.   
Poems are the fruit of the evasions   
Of a life spent trying to understand 
The vacuum at the center of the heart,   
And for all the intricate persuasions   
They enlist in the service of their art, 
Are finally small, disappointing things.   
Yet from them there materializes   
A way of life, a way of life that brings 
The fleeting pleasures of a vocation   
Made up of these constant exercises   
In what still passes for celebration, 
That began in a mood of hopelessness   
On an evening in a dormitory
Years and years ago, and seemed to promise 
A respite from disquietude and care,   
But that left only the lovely story
Of a bright presence hanging in the air.

Veritas sequitur ...



In the small beauty of the forest
The wild deer bedding down—
That they are there! 
                              Their eyes
Effortless, the soft lips
Nuzzle and the alien small teeth
Tear at the grass 
                              The roots of it
Dangle from their mouths
Scattering earth in the strange woods.
They who are there. 
                              Their paths
Nibbled thru the fields, the leaves that shade them
Hang in the distances
Of sun 
                              The small nouns
Crying faith
In this in which the wild deer   
Startle, and stare out.

Miracles Attending Israel’s Journey



When Isr’el, freed from Pharaoh’s hand, Left the proud tyrant and his land, The tribes with cheerful homage own Their king; and Judah was his throne.  Across the deep their journey lay; The deep divides to make them way. Jordan beheld their march, and led, With backward current, to his head.  The mountains shook like frighted sheep, Like lambs the little hillocks leap; Not Sinai on her base could stand, Conscious of sov’reign pow’r at hand.  What pow’r could make the deep divide? Make Jordan backward roll his tide? Why did ye leap, ye little hills? And whence the fright that Sinai feels?  Let ev’ry mountain, ev’ry flood, Retire and know th’ approaching God, The King of Isr’el: see him here! Tremble, thou earth, adore and fear.  He thunders, and all nature mourns; The rock to standing pools he turns, Flints spring with fountains at his word, And fires and seas confess the Lord.


^^EOP^^

When Israel came from Egypt’s coast,    And Goshen’s marshy plains, And Jacob with his joyful host    From servitude and chains;  Then was it seen how much the Jews    Were holy in his sight, And God did Israel’s kingdom choose    To manifest his might.  The sea beheld it, and with dread    Retreated to make way; And Jordan to his fountain head    Ran backwards in dismay.  The mountains, like the rams that bound,    Exulted on their base; Like lambs the little hills around    Skipt lightly from their place.  What is the cause, thou mighty sea,    That thou thyself should shun; And Jordan, what is come to thee,    That thou should backward run?  Ye mountains that ye leaped so high    From off the solid rock, Ye hills that ye should gambols try,    Like firstlings of the flock?  Earth, from the center to the sod    His fearful presence hail The presence of Jeshurun’s God,    In whom our arms prevail.  Who beds of rocks in pools to stand    Can by his word compel, And from the veiny flint command    The fountain and the well.

Warning to Magistrates



Judges, who rule the world by laws, Will ye despise the righteous cause,    When th’injur’d poor before you stands? Dare ye condemn the righteous poor, And let rich sinners ’scape secure,    While gold and greatness bribe your hands?  Have ye forgot or never knew That God will judge the judges too?    High in the Heavens his justice reigns; Yet you invade the rights of God, And send your bold decrees abroad    To bind the conscience in your chains.  A poisoned arrow is your tongue, The arrow sharp, the poison strong,    And death attends where e’er it wounds: You hear no counsels, cries or tears; So the deaf adder stops her ears    Against the power of charming sounds.  Break out their teeth, eternal God, Those teeth of lions dyed in blood;    And crush the serpents in the dust: As empty chaff, when whirlwinds rise, Before the sweeping tempest flies,    So let their hopes and names be lost.  Th’Almighty thunders from the sky, Their grandeur melts, their titles die,    As hills of snow dissolve and run, Or snails that perish in their slime, Or births that come before their time,    Vain births, that never see the sun.  Thus shall the vengeance of the Lord Safety and joy to saints afford;    And all that hear shall join and say, “Sure there’s a God that rules on high, “A God that hears his children cry,    “And will their sufferings well repay.”


^^EOP^^

Ye congregation of the tribes,     On justice do you set your mind; And are ye free from guile and bribes    Ye judges of mankind?  Nay, ye of frail and mortal mould    Imagine mischief in your heart; Your suffrages and selves are sold    Unto the general mart.  Men of unrighteous seed betray    Perverseness from their mother’s womb; As soon as they can run astray,    Against the truth presume.  They are with foul infection stained,    Ev’n with the serpent’s taint impure; Their ears to blest persuasion chained,    And locked against her lure.  Though Christ himself the pipe should tune,    They will not to the measure tread, Nor will they with his grief commune    Though tears of blood he shed.  Lord, humanize their scoff and scorn,    And their malevolence defeat; Of water and the spirit born    Let grace their change complete.  Let them with pious ardor burn,    And make thy holy church their choice; To thee with all their passions turn,    And in thy light rejoice.  As quick as lightning to its mark,    So let thy gracious angel speed; And take their spirits in thine ark    To their eternal mead.  The righteous shall exult the more    As he such powerful mercy sees, Such wrecks and ruins safe on shore,    Such tortured souls at ease.  So that a man shall say, no doubt,    The penitent has his reward; There is a God to bear him out,    And he is Christ our Lord.

Tell me not in mormonful numbers       “Life is but an empty dream!” To a student of the slumbers       Things are never what they seem.  Life is yearning and suppression;       Life is that to be enjoyed; Puritanical discretion       Was not spoke by Dr. Freud.  Deep enjoyment, and not sorrow,       Is our destined end or way; But to dream, that each to-morrow       Finds us Freudier than to-day.  Sleep is long, and dreams are straying,       And our hearts, though they may falter, Still, like sexiphones, are playing       Wedding marches to the altar.  In the universal battle,       In the seraglio of life, Be not like dumb, driven cattle—       Beat your husband—or your wife.  Trust no dame, however pleasant!       Leave the dead ones on the shelf! Act—act in the living present!       Nothing matters but Yourself.  Wives of great men all remind us       We can make our lives a serial, And, departing, leave behind us       Biographical material.  Stories that perhaps another       Sailing o’er life’s Freudian sea— A forlorn and dream-racked brother—       Reading, might say, “How like me!”  Let us then be up and doing,       With a heart for any mate; Now eluding, nor pursuing,       Learn to individuate.

To peer into the obverse
into smoking cane field erratums
as if haunted with the steamy colitis of whirling iridium   
cancellations 
as in the saliva of newts
one sees the intestinal raging of deltas
of blackened sea giraffes osmotically split into simultaneous alums   
above a judgemental sea glistening with Richters 
like a weakened neutron egg
its fissioning petrol mirages like spirals of irregular hunting geese   
flying through flames of ulcerated smoke & gargantua
hissing a blank imperial greenness
rising above dense jetties of cobras 
the shocking demise of the sea
the unlivingness of its winds
scorched by irradiations of shaking brine incisions
the burning gulfs of sun with a glint of explosive Mandean utopias*
shocks against Old Testament linear prophetics
of Jeremiah
or Ezekiel
or the bony frozen finger shaking stunted alchemical missives   
from a moon burned Judea
no more than a mechanically burning moat focused on smoky   
spellbinder’s disruptives
where the motion of the soul is delayed
reduced to flattened agnostic secular smoke
to a terrestrial rage which eliminates its sensuous heavenly fires   
its stunning unreplicated angers
its sudden selenium spirals
its fire which staggers across the pseudo-faultlines of pre-replicated judgement
its flirtation with spirits of enriched Draconian plankton 
so that the soul with its amber of flashing microbe drachmas   
with its wounded tourmaline divisibilities
flaming within a light of smeared tornado weathers   
within a shower of black fish scales & spleen
is entombed
within a blank thirstless psycho-motion
falling from a furnace of stars
which both flares up and freezes
which inculcates a flawed microbial botany
as in hypnotic grammatical emulsions 
within a hollowed elliptical opening where we witness old   
Egyptian surgeries
where the dead magically rise up from mazes
& stare in a language of scorching totemic anomaly   
spawned in heretical miniature
their phantoms
seeping from quadrilateral sutures
from brief
violent
renunciatory squalls 
uprooted
armed with the weaponry of ghouls
& broken birch tree lizards
seasoned by the light of psychotropic angles
blazing in the middle of a green Venusian interior God
singing
as if
in the fumaroles of anguish   
with an inclement bleeding   
with a littered corona
of unstable altimeter reverses

There was always a lizard
Or a frog around the pump,
Waiting for a little extra water
Or a butterfly to light. 
Jimmy said the pump gave him the worms.
I got the worms under the slick boards.
The pump would bite you in the winter.
It got hold of Jimmy and wouldn’t let go. 
The blades of Johnson grass were tall
And sharp around the pump stand.
I had to hoe them all the time
Nobody filled the prime jar, though. 
One time, I cut the tongue
Out of a Buster Brown shoe
And gave it to the pump.
It made a good sucker washer. 
Sometimes the pump seemed like Jesus.
I liked bathing buck naked
Under the pump,
Not in a goddamn washtub.

Out here on Cottage Grove it matters. The galloping
Wind balks at its shadow. The carriages
Are drawn forward under a sky of fumed oak.
This is America calling:
The mirroring of state to state,   
Of voice to voice on the wires,
The force of colloquial greetings like golden
Pollen sinking on the afternoon breeze.
In service stairs the sweet corruption thrives;
The page of dusk turns like a creaking revolving stage in Warren, Ohio. 
If this is the way it is let’s leave,
They agree, and soon the slow boxcar journey begins,   
Gradually accelerating until the gyrating fans of suburbs   
Enfolding the darkness of cities are remembered   
Only as a recurring tic. And midway
We meet the disappointed, returning ones, without its   
Being able to stop us in the headlong night
Toward the nothing of the coast. At Bolinas
The houses doze and seem to wonder why through the   
Pacific haze, and the dreams alternately glow and grow dull.   
Why be hanging on here? Like kites, circling,   
Slipping on a ramp of air, but always circling? 
But the variable cloudiness is pouring it on,
Flooding back to you like the meaning of a joke.
The land wasn’t immediately appealing; we built it
Partly over with fake ruins, in the image of ourselves:
An arch that terminates in mid-keystone, a crumbling stone pier   
For laundresses, an open-air theater, never completed
And only partially designed. How are we to inhabit
This space from which the fourth wall is invariably missing,   
As in a stage-set or dollhouse, except by staying as we are,   
In lost profile, facing the stars, with dozens of as yet
Unrealized projects, and a strict sense
Of time running out, of evening presenting   
The tactfully folded-over bill? And we fit   
Rather too easily into it, become transparent,   
Almost ghosts. One day
The birds and animals in the pasture have absorbed   
The color, the density of the surroundings,   
The leaves are alive, and too heavy with life. 
A long period of adjustment followed.
In the cities at the turn of the century they knew about it   
But were careful not to let on as the iceman and the milkman   
Disappeared down the block and the postman shouted   
His daily rounds. The children under the trees knew it   
But all the fathers returning home
On streetcars after a satisfying day at the office undid it:   
The climate was still floral and all the wallpaper   
In a million homes all over the land conspired to hide it.   
One day we thought of painted furniture, of how   
It just slightly changes everything in the room
And in the yard outside, and how, if we were going
To be able to write the history of our time, starting with today,   
It would be necessary to model all these unimportant details   
So as to be able to include them; otherwise the narrative   
Would have that flat, sandpapered look the sky gets   
Out in the middle west toward the end of summer,   
The look of wanting to back out before the argument   
Has been resolved, and at the same time to save appearances
So that tomorrow will be pure. Therefore, since we have to do our business   
In spite of things, why not make it in spite of everything?   
That way, maybe the feeble lakes and swamps
Of the back country will get plugged into the circuit   
And not just the major events but the whole incredible
Mass of everything happening simultaneously and pairing off,
Channeling itself into history, will unroll
As carefully and as casually as a conversation in the next room,   
And the purity of today will invest us like a breeze,
Only be hard, spare, ironical: something one can
Tip one’s hat to and still get some use out of. 
The parade is turning into our street.
My stars, the burnished uniforms and prismatic   
Features of this instant belong here. The land
Is pulling away from the magic, glittering coastal towns
To an aforementioned rendezvous with August and December.   
The hunch is it will always be this way,   
The look, the way things first scared you   
In the night light, and later turned out to be,   
Yet still capable, all the same, of a narrow fidelity   
To what you and they wanted to become:   
No sighs like Russian music, only a vast unravelling   
Out toward the junctions and to the darkness beyond   
To these bare fields, built at today’s expense.

[FOR WARREN WINSLOW, DEAD AT SEA]

Let man have dominion over the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the air and the beasts of the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth. 



I 
A brackish reach of shoal off Madaket—
The sea was still breaking violently and night   
Had steamed into our North Atlantic Fleet,
When the drowned sailor clutched the drag-net. Light   
Flashed from his matted head and marble feet,   
He grappled at the net
With the coiled, hurdling muscles of his thighs:
The corpse was bloodless, a botch of reds and whites,   
Its open, staring eyes
Were lustreless dead-lights
Or cabin-windows on a stranded hulk   
Heavy with sand. We weight the body, close   
Its eyes and heave it seaward whence it came,   
Where the heel-headed dogfish barks its nose   
On Ahab’s void and forehead; and the name   
Is blocked in yellow chalk.
Sailors, who pitch this portent at the sea   
Where dreadnaughts shall confess
Its hell-bent deity,
When you are powerless
To sand-bag this Atlantic bulwark, faced
By the earth-shaker, green, unwearied, chaste   
In his steel scales: ask for no Orphean lute
To pluck life back. The guns of the steeled fleet   
Recoil and then repeat
The hoarse salute.   II 
Whenever winds are moving and their breath   
Heaves at the roped-in bulwarks of this pier,   
The terns and sea-gulls tremble at your death   
In these home waters. Sailor, can you hear   
The Pequod’s sea wings, beating landward, fall   
Headlong and break on our Atlantic wall   
Off ’Sconset, where the yawing S-boats splash   
The bellbuoy, with ballooning spinnakers,   
As the entangled, screeching mainsheet clears   
The blocks: off Madaket, where lubbers lash   
The heavy surf and throw their long lead squids   
For blue-fish? Sea-gulls blink their heavy lids   
Seaward. The winds’ wings beat upon the stones,   
Cousin, and scream for you and the claws rush   
At the sea’s throat and wring it in the slush   
Of this old Quaker graveyard where the bones   
Cry out in the long night for the hurt beast   
Bobbing by Ahab’s whaleboats in the East.   III 
All you recovered from Poseidon died
With you, my cousin, and the harrowed brine   
Is fruitless on the blue beard of the god,   
Stretching beyond us to the castles in Spain,   
Nantucket’s westward haven. To Cape Cod   
Guns, cradled on the tide,
Blast the eelgrass about a waterclock
Of bilge and backwash, roil the salt and sand   
Lashing earth’s scaffold, rock
Our warships in the hand
Of the great God, where time’s contrition blues   
Whatever it was these Quaker sailors lost
In the mad scramble of their lives. They died   
When time was open-eyed,
Wooden and childish; only bones abide
There, in the nowhere, where their boats were tossed   
Sky-high, where mariners had fabled news   
Of IS, the whited monster. What it cost   
Them is their secret. In the sperm-whale’s slick   
I see the Quakers drown and hear their cry:   
“If God himself had not been on our side,   
If God himself had not been on our side,   
When the Atlantic rose against us, why,   
Then it had swallowed us up quick.”   IV 
This is the end of the whaleroad and the whale
Who spewed Nantucket bones on the thrashed swell   
And stirred the troubled waters to whirlpools   
To send the Pequod packing off to hell:   
This is the end of them, three-quarters fools,   
Snatching at straws to sail
Seaward and seaward on the turntail whale,   
Spouting out blood and water as it rolls,   
Sick as a dog to these Atlantic shoals: Clamavimus, O depths. Let the sea-gulls wail 
For water, for the deep where the high tide   
Mutters to its hurt self, mutters and ebbs.   
Waves wallow in their wash, go out and out,   
Leave only the death-rattle of the crabs,   
The beach increasing, its enormous snout   
Sucking the ocean’s side.
This is the end of running on the waves;
We are poured out like water. Who will dance
The mast-lashed master of Leviathans
Up from this field of Quakers in their unstoned graves?   V 
When the whale’s viscera go and the roll   
Of its corruption overruns this world
Beyond tree-swept Nantucket and Woods Hole   
And Martha’s Vineyard, Sailor, will your sword   
Whistle and fall and sink into the fat?
In the great ash-pit of Jehoshaphat
The bones cry for the blood of the white whale,   
The fat flukes arch and whack about its ears,   
The death-lance churns into the sanctuary, tears   
The gun-blue swingle, heaving like a flail,
And hacks the coiling life out: it works and drags   
And rips the sperm-whale’s midriff into rags,   
Gobbets of blubber spill to wind and weather,   
Sailor, and gulls go round the stoven timbers   
Where the morning stars sing out together
And thunder shakes the white surf and dismembers   
The red flag hammered in the mast-head. Hide   
Our steel, Jonas Messias, in Thy side.   VI  OUR LADY OF WALSINGHAM 
There once the penitents took off their shoes   
And then walked barefoot the remaining mile;   
And the small trees, a stream and hedgerows file   
Slowly along the munching English lane,   
Like cows to the old shrine, until you lose   
Track of your dragging pain.
The stream flows down under the druid tree,   
Shiloah’s whirlpools gurgle and make glad   
The castle of God. Sailor, you were glad   
And whistled Sion by that stream. But see: 
Our Lady, too small for her canopy,
Sits near the altar. There’s no comeliness   
At all or charm in that expressionless
Face with its heavy eyelids. As before,
This face, for centuries a memory, Non est species, neque decor,
Expressionless, expresses God: it goes
Past castled Sion. She knows what God knows,   
Not Calvary’s Cross nor crib at Bethlehem   
Now, and the world shall come to Walsingham.   VII 
The empty winds are creaking and the oak   
Splatters and splatters on the cenotaph,   
The boughs are trembling and a gaff   
Bobs on the untimely stroke
Of the greased wash exploding on a shoal-bell   
In the old mouth of the Atlantic. It’s well;   
Atlantic, you are fouled with the blue sailors,   
Sea-monsters, upward angel, downward fish:   
Unmarried and corroding, spare of flesh   
Mart once of supercilious, wing’d clippers,   
Atlantic, where your bell-trap guts its spoil   
You could cut the brackish winds with a knife   
Here in Nantucket, and cast up the time
When the Lord God formed man from the sea’s slime   
And breathed into his face the breath of life,   
And blue-lung’d combers lumbered to the kill.   
The Lord survives the rainbow of His will.

Seeing my friend’s son in his broad-brimmed hat
and suspenders, I think of the Quakers
who lectured us on nonviolent social action
every week when I was a child. In the classrooms
we listened to those who would not take up arms,
who objected, who had accepted alternative
service in distant work camps and showed
slides of hospitals they helped to build.
On Wednesdays, in Meeting for Worship,
when someone rose to speak,
all the energy in the room
flew inside her mouth, empowering her to tell
what she had seen on her brief
encounter with the divine: sometimes, a parable,
a riddle, a kindness. The fall that we were seventeen,
we scuffed our loafers on the gravelly path
from the Meetinghouse, while maple and elm
leaves sailed around our shoulders   
like tiny envelopes, our futures sealed inside.
Despite the war in Vietnam, I felt safer
than I ever would again. Perhaps
those aged, protective trees had cast a spell
on us, or maybe the nonviolent Quaker God
had set up a kingdom right there—
suburban Philadelphia. Looking back, I see how
good deeds and thoughts climbed with us to the attic
room for Latin, descended to the gym for sports,
where we hung from the praiseworthy scaffolds
of righteous behavior. We prepared to leave
for college, armed with the language of the American
Friends and the memories of Thanksgiving
dinners we’d cooked for the unfortunates:
borrowing our parents’ cars to drive
downtown to the drop-off point, racing back
to play our last field hockey match. Grim center forwards
shook hands before the whistle, the half-backs’
knee-pads strapped on tight; one varsity team vanquished another.

June 7, 1990



breath,
life after seven decades plus three years
is a lot of breathing. seventy three years on this
earth is a lot of taking in and giving out, is a
life of coming from somewhere and for many a bunch
of going nowhere. 
how do we celebrate a poet who has created
music with words for over fifty years, who has
showered magic on her people, who has redefined
poetry into a black world exactness
thereby giving the universe an insight into
darkroads? 
just say she interprets beauty and wants to
give life, say she is patient with phoniness
and doesn’t mind people calling her gwen or sister.
say she sees the genius in our children, is visionary
about possibilities, sees as clearly as ray charles and
stevie wonder, hears like determined elephants looking
for food. say that her touch is fine wood, her memory
is like an african roadmap detailing adventure and
clarity, yet returning to chicago’s south evans
to record the journey. say her voice is majestic
and magnetic as she speaks in poetry, rhythms, song
and spirited trumpets, say she is dark skinned,
melanin rich, small-boned, hurricane-willed,
with a mind like a tornado redefining the landscape. 
life after seven decades plus three years
is a lot of breathing.
gwendolyn, gwen, sister g has
not disappointed our expectations.
in the middle
of her eldership she brings us
vigorous language, memory,
illumination. 
she brings breath.

Her body is not so white as
anemony petals nor so smooth—nor
so remote a thing. It is a field
of the wild carrot taking
the field by force; the grass
does not raise above it.
Here is no question of whiteness,
white as can be, with a purple mole
at the center of each flower.
Each flower is a hand’s span
of her whiteness. Wherever
his hand has lain there is
a tiny purple blemish. Each part
is a blossom under his touch
to which the fibres of her being
stem one by one, each to its end,
until the whole field is a
white desire, empty, a single stem,
a cluster, flower by flower,
a pious wish to whiteness gone over—
or nothing.

Where will I sleep   
How will I ride   
What will I hunt 
Where can I go
without my mount   
all eager and quick   
How will I know

How will it be

without roof or door

With cloud for shift

While needles of the evergreen
practice a windy chaos,
heads of snarled hair;
something in the tree
longs for old age;
bald brown knobs of skull
without subterfuge;
but it continues with its greedy
resinous sexual odors.
The odors rise against one another,
spurting away from the scaly bark.
Along its fingers the tree
holds out microscopic traps.
Popping bullets of sunlight
crack into the subliminal
orifices, and the tree thinks,
“How exquisite. Is this love?”

of us wonder why
we crowded, as strange,
monstrous bodies, blindly into one

Everything’s been said
But one last thing about the desert,
And it’s awful: During brush fires in the Sonoran desert,
Brush fires that happen before the monsoon and in the great,
Deep, wide, and smothering heat of the hottest months,
The longest months,
The hypnotic, immeasurable lulls of August and July—
During these summer fires, jackrabbits—
Jackrabbits and everything else
That lives in the brush of the rolling hills,
But jackrabbits especially—
Jackrabbits can get caught in the flames,
No matter how fast and big and strong and sleek they are.
And when they’re caught,
Cornered in and against the thick
Trunks and thin spines of the cactus,
When they can’t back up any more,
When they can’t move, the flame—
It touches them,
And their fur catches fire.
Of course, they run away from the flame,
Finding movement even when there is none to be found,
Jumping big and high over the wave of fire, or backing
Even harder through the impenetrable
Tangle of hardened saguaro
And prickly pear and cholla and barrel,
But whichever way they find,
What happens is what happens: They catch fire
And then bring the fire with them when they run.
They don’t know they’re on fire at first,
Running so fast as to make the fire
Shoot like rocket engines and smoke behind them,
But then the rabbits tire
And the fire catches up,
Stuck onto them like the needles of the cactus,
Which at first must be what they think they feel on their skins.
They’ve felt this before, every rabbit.
But this time the feeling keeps on.
And of course, they ignite the brush and dried weeds
All over again, making more fire, all around them.
I’m sorry for the rabbits.
And I’m sorry for us
To know this.

Thousands of planes were flying and then
they stopped. We spend days moving our eyes 
across makeshift desks, we sit on a makeshift floor;
we prepare for almost nothing that might happen. 
Early on, distant relations kept calling.
Now, nothing: sound of water 
tippling a seawall. Nothing: sparks
lighting the brush, sparks polishing the hail, 
the flotsam of cars left standing perfectly still.
Thud of night bird against night air, 
there you are on the porch, swath
of feathers visible through the glass, 
there you are on the stairs where the cat fell
like a stone because her heart stopped. 
What have you found in the wind above town square?
Is it true that even the statues have gone? 
Is there really a hush over everything as there used to be
in morning when one by one we took off our veils?

It has arrived—the long rag rug
multiply folded. On top, one alien hair.
I put my face to the folds and smell despair
palpable as salt air
in all those rooms and houses, small and smug—
enclosures I passed through on my way where? 
Whoever did the weaving appears old
in my mind’s eye. I can’t make out her face,
can only conjure up the faintest trace
of an abstracted grace,
clack of the loom. Does she know they’ll be sold
these precious things, in some unheard-of place? 
I perch her on a hill, precariously
beyond the reach of waves’ daily boom.
Sun blazes overhead, but her dim room
(no bigger than the loom)
is proof against the violence of the sky
From it I further spin what I once called my home: 
Endless horizons fading into haze,
the mornings dawn came up so rosy clear;
snails in the garden, sheep bells everywhere,
the brightness of the air,
terraces, valleys organizing space
and time’s cessation. So this package here 
I’m now unwrapping, in New York, today
(rugs like rainbows, woven with a grace
my strands of language barely can express;
dishrags of dailiness
dispersed and recombined and freshly gay)
comes to me imbued with images, 
slowly and faithfully across the water,
across the world. It represents a time
I myself snipped and recombined as rhyme
as soon as I went home,
if that is where I am. These rugs recover
the sense of stepping twice into a single river.

Clouds spout upon her
  Their waters amain
  In ruthless disdain, –Her who but lately
  Had shivered with pain As at touch of dishonourIf there had lit on herSo coldly, so straightly
  Such arrows of rain:
One who to shelter
  Her delicate headWould quicken and quicken
  Each tentative treadIf drops chanced to pelt her
  That summertime spills
  In dust-paven rillsWhen thunder-clouds thicken
  And birds close their bills.
Would that I lay there
  And she were housed here!Or better, togetherWere folded away thereExposed to one weatherWe both, – who would stray there When sunny the day there, 
  Or evening was clear
  At the prime of the year.
Soon will be growing
  Green blades from her mound,And daisies be showing
  Like stars on the ground,Till she form part of them – Ay – the sweet heart of them,Loved beyond measureWith a child’s pleasure
  All her life’s round.

When my older brother
came back from war
he had on his forehead a little silver star
and under the star
an abyss 
a splinter of shrapnel
hit him at Verdun
or perhaps at Grünwald
(he’d forgotten the details) 
he used to talk much
in many languages
but he liked most of all
the language of history 
until losing breath
he commanded his dead pals to run
Roland Kowaski Hannibal 
he shouted
that this was the last crusade
that Carthage soon would fall
and then sobbing confessed
that Napoleon did not like him 
we looked at him
getting paler and paler
abandoned by his senses
he turned slowly into a monument 
into musical shells of ears
entered a stone forest
and the skin of his face
was secured
with the blind dry
buttons of eyes 
nothing was left him
but touch 
what stories
he told with his hands
in the right he had romances
in the left soldier’s memories 
they took my brother
and carried him out of town
he returns every fall
slim and very quiet
he does not want to come in
he knocks at the window for me 
we walk together in the streets
and he recites to me
improbable tales
touching my face
with blind fingers of rain

If things were worse, this cursed rain
would soak me unto sickness,
so Samuel Sewall might have
written in his vespers journal.
I have it on my writing desk
inside. For three days I have
labored with a saw and plane
and many boards to make my girl
a swingset near her mother’s
lilac shrubs, as rain has drizzled
cold and meaningless. How
coherent was his world of works
and days, when Plentifull Rains
might connote a coming
providence—so Sewall notes
of Her Majesty’s Court, June
the eighteenth, seventeen twelve.              We are well satisfyed with the Layin out

And Summer turns her head with its dark tangle   
All the way toward us; and the trees are heavy,   
With little sprays of limp green maple and linden   
Adhering after a rainstorm to the sidewalk   
Where yellow pollen dries in pools and runnels. 
Along the oceanfront, pink neon at dusk:
The long, late dusk, a light wind from the water   
Lifting a girl’s hair forward against her cheek
And swaying a chain of bulbs.
                                              In luminous booths,
The bright, traditional wheel is on its ratchet,
And ticking gaily at its little pawl;
And the surf revolves; and passing cars and people,
Their brilliant colors—all strange and hopeful as Ralegh’s   
Trophies: the balsam, the prizes of untried virtue,   
Bananas and armadillos that a Captain
Carries his Monarch from another world.

Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under, Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,Swelling on either side to want his bliss;Between whose hills her head entombed is;
  Where like a virtuous monument she lies,
  To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.
Without the bed her other fair hand was,On the green coverlet, whose perfect whiteShowed like an April daisy on the grass,With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
  And canopied in darkness sweetly lay
  Till they might open to adorn the day.
Her hair like golden threads played with her breathO modest wantons, wanton modesty!Showing life’s triumph in the map of death,And death’s dim look in life’s mortality.Each in her sleep themselves so beautify
  As if between them twain there were no strife,
  But that life lived in death, and death in life.
Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,A pair of maiden worlds unconquerèd,Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,And him by oath they truly honourèd.These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred,
  Who like a foul usurper went about
  From this fair throne to heave the owner out.
What could he see but mightily he noted?What did he note but strongly he desired?What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,And in his will his willful eye he tired.With more than admiration he admired
  Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,
  Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.
As the grim lion fawneth o’er his preySharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,So o’er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,His rage of lust by gazing qualified;Slacked, not suppressed; for, standing by her side,
  His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.
And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting.In bloody death and ravishment delighting,Nor children’s tears nor mothers’ groans respecting,Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting.
  Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,
  Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.
His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,His eye commends the leading to his hand;His hand, as proud of such a dignity,Smoking with pride, marched on to make his standOn her bare breast, the heart of all her land,
  Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,
  Left their round turrets destitute and pale.
They, mustering to the quiet cabinetWhere their dear governess and lady lies,Do tell her she is dreadfully besetAnd fright her with confusion of their cries.She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,
  Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,
  Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.
Imagine her as one in dead of nightFrom forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking.What terror ‘tis! but she, in worser taking,
  From sleep disturbèd, heedfully doth view
  The sight which makes supposèd terror true.
Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,Like to a new-killed bird she trembling lies.She dares not look; yet, winking, there appearsQuick-shifting antics ugly in her eyes.Such shadows are the weak brain’s forgeries,
  Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
  In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.
His hand, that yet remains upon her breast(Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!)May feel her heart (poor citizen) distressed,Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
  This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
  To make the breach and enter this sweet city.

I’m a rattling boy from Dublin town,
    I courted a girl called Biddy Brown,Her eyes they were as black as sloes,
    She had black hair and an aquiline nose.
 Chorus—       Whack fal de da, fal de darelido,
    Whack fal de da, fal de darelay,
    Whack fal de da, fal de darelido,
    Whack fal de da, fal de darelay.
One night I met her with another lad,
    Says I, Biddy, I’ve caught you, by dad;I never thought you were half so bad
    As to be going about with another lad.
 Chorus.  Says I, Biddy, this will never do,
    For to-night you’ve prov’d to me untrue,So do not make a hullaballoo,
    For I will bid farewell to you.
 Chorus.  Says Barney Magee, She is my lass,
    And the man that says no, he is an ass,So come away, and I’ll give you a glass,
    Och, sure you can get another lass.
 Chorus.  Says I, To the devil with your glass,
    You have taken from me my darling lass,And if you look angry, or offer to frown,
    With my darling shillelah I’ll knock you down.
 Chorus.  Says Barney Magee unto me,
    By the hokey I love Biddy Brown,And before I’ll give her up to thee,
    One or both of us will go down.
 Chorus.  So, with my darling shillelah, I gave him a whack,
    Which left him lying on his back,Saying, botheration to you and Biddy Brown,—
    For I’m the rattling boy from Dublin town.
 Chorus.  So a policeman chanced to come up at the time,
    And he asked of me the cause of the shine,Says I, he threatened to knock me down
    When I challenged him for walking with my Biddy Brown.
 Chorus.  So the policeman took Barney Magee to jail,
    Which made him shout and bewailThat ever he met with Biddy Brown,
    The greatest deceiver in Dublin town.
 Chorus.  So I bade farewell to Biddy Brown,
    The greatest jilter in Dublin town,Because she proved untrue to me,
    And was going about with Barney Magee.
 Chorus.

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.” 
    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
            Nameless here for evermore. 
    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
            This it is and nothing more.” 
    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
            Darkness there and nothing more. 
    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—
            Merely this and nothing more. 
    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
            ’Tis the wind and nothing more!” 
    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
            Perched, and sat, and nothing more. 
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” 
    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
            With such name as “Nevermore.” 
    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
            Then the bird said “Nevermore.” 
    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store
    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.” 
    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.” 
    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,
            She shall press, ah, nevermore! 
    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
    Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” 
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
    On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” 
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” 
    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
    Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” 
    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
    And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
            Shall be lifted—nevermore!

“It isn’t a game for girls,”
he said, grabbing a fifth
with his right hand,
the wind with his left. 
“For six days
I raced Jack Daniels.
He cheated, told jokes.
Some weren’t even funny. 
That’s how come he won.
It took a long time
to reach this Yellow River.
I’m not yet thirty, 
or is it thirty-one?
Figured all my years
carried the same hard thaw.
Out here, houselights hid 
deep inside the trees.
For awhile I believed this road
cut across to Spring Creek
and I was trucking home. 
I could kid you now,
say I ran it clean,
gasping on one lung,
loaded by a knapsack 
of distrust and hesitation.
I never got the tone
in all the talk of cure.
I sang Honor Songs, crawled 
the railroad bridge to Canada.
Dizzy from the ties,
I hung between both worlds.
Clans of blackbirds circled 
the nearby maple trees.
The dark heart of me said
no days more than these.
As sundown kindled the sumacs, 
stunned by the river’s smile,
I had no need for heat,
no need to feel ashamed.
Inside me then the sound 
of burning leaves. Tell them
I tumbled through a gap on the horizon.
No, say I stumbled through a hummock
and fell in a pit of stars. 
When rain weakened my stride,
I heard them singing
in a burl of white ash,
took a few more days to rave 
at them in this wood.
Then their appaloosas nickered
in the dawn and they came
riding down a close ravine. 
Though the bottle was empty,
I still hung on. Foxtails beat
the grimace from my brow
until I took off my pain 
like a pair of old boots.
I became a hollow horn filled
with rain, reflecting everything.
The wind in my hand 
burned cold as hoarfrost
when my grandfather nudged me
and called out
my Lakota name.”

Is dead serious about this one, having rehearsed it for two weeks
they bring it right into the Odd Fellows Meeting Hall.
Riding the backs of the Trojan Women,
In Euripides’ great wake they are swept up, 
But the women of the chorus, in black stockings and kerchiefs,
Stand up bravely to it, shawled arms thrash
In a foam of hysterical voices shrieking,
Seaweed on the wet flanks of a whale, 
For each town has its Cassandra who is a little crazy,
Wed to some mystery or other and therefore painfully sensitive,
Wiser than anyone but no one listens to her, these days the terror
Reaches its red claws into back ward and living room alike, 
For each town has its Andromache who is too young,
With snub nose and children just out of school
Even she cannot escape it, from the bombed city she is led out
Weeping among the ambulances, 
And each community has its tart, its magical false Helen
Or at least someone who looks like her, in all the make-up she can muster,
The gorgeous mask of whatever quick-witted lie will keep her alive
At least a little while longer, on the crest of the bloody wave, 
That dolorous mountain of wooden ships and water
In whose memory the women bring us this huge gift horse,
This raging animal of a play no one dares to look in the eye
For fear of what’s hidden there: 
Small ragdoll figures toppling over and over
From every skyscraper and battlement hurtling
Men and women both, mere gristle in the teeth of fate.
Out over the sea of the audience our numb faces 
Are stunned as Andromache’s, locked up there on the platform
Inside Euripides’ machine the women sway and struggle
One foot at a time, up the surging ladder
Of grief piled on grief, strophe on antistrophe, 
In every century the same, the master tightens the screws,
Heightens the gloss of each bitter scene
And strikes every key, each word rings out
Over our terrified heads like a brass trumpet, 
For this gift is an accordion, the biggest and mightiest of all,
As the glittering lacquered box heaves in and out,
Sigh upon sigh, at the topmost pitch a child
Falls through midnight in his frantically pink skin. 
As the anguished queen protests, the citizens in the chorus wail
Louder and louder, the warriors depart
Without a glance backwards, these captains of the world’s death
Enslaved as they are enslavers, in a rain of willess atoms 
anonymity takes over utterly: as the flaming city falls
On this bare beach, in the drab pinewood hall
The Reading Club packs up to go; scripts, coffee cups, black stockings,
Husbands and wives pile into the waiting cars 
Just as we expect, life picks up and goes on
But not art: crouched back there like a stalled stallion
Stuffed in its gorgeous music box is the one gift
That will not disappear but waits, but bides its time and waits 
For the next time we open it, that magical false structure
Inside whose artifice is the lesson, buried alive,
Of the grim machinations of the beautiful that always lead us
To these eternally real lamentations, real sufferings, real cries.

All around the altar, huge lianas
curled, unfurled the dark green
of their leaves to complement the red
of blood spilled there—a kind of Christmas
decoration, overhung with heavy vines
and over them, the stars.
When the angels came, messengers like birds
but with the oiled flesh of men, they hung
over the scene with smoldering swords,
splashing the world when they beat
their rain-soaked wings against the turning sky. 
The child was bright in his basket
as a lemon, with a bitter smell from his wet
swaddling clothes. His mother bent
above him, singing a lullaby
in the liquid tongue invented
for the very young—short syllables
like dripping from an eave
mixed with the first big drops of rain
that fell, like tiny silver pears, from
the glistening fronds of palm. The three
who gathered there—old kings uncrowned:
the cockroach, condor, and the leopard, lords
of the cracks below the ground, the mountain
pass and the grass-grown plain—were not
adorned, did not bear gifts, had not
come to adore; they were simply drawn
to gawk at this recurrent, awkward son
whom the wind had said would spell
the end of earth as it had been. 
Somewhere north of this familiar scene
the polar caps were melting, the water was
advancing in its slow, relentless
lines, swallowing the old
landmarks, swelling the
seas that pulled
the flowers and the great steel cities down.
The dolphins sport in the rising sea,
anemones wave their many arms like hair
on a drowned gorgon’s head, her features
softened by the sea beyond all recognition. 
On the desert’s edge where the oasis dies
in a wash of sand, the sphinx seems to shift
on her haunches of stone, and the rain, as it runs down,
completes the ruin of her face. The Nile
merges with the sea, the waters rise
and drown the noise of earth. At the forest’s
edge, where the child sleeps, the waters gather—
as if a hand were reaching for the curtain
to drop across the glowing, lit tableau. 
When the waves closed over, completing the green
sweep of ocean, there was no time for mourning.
No final trump, no thunder to announce
the silent steal of waters; how soundlessly
it all went under: the little family
and the scene so easily mistaken
for an adoration. Above, more clouds poured in
and closed their ranks across the skies;
the angels, who had seemed so solid, turned
quicksilver in the rain.
                                     Now, nothing but the wind
moves on the rain-pocked face
of the swollen waters, though far below
where giant squid lie hidden in shy tangles,
the whales, heavy-bodied as the angels,
their fins like vestiges of wings,
sing some mighty epic of their own— 
a great day when the ships would all withdraw,
the harpoons fail of their aim, the land
dissolve into the waters, and they would swim
among the peaks of mountains, like eagles
of the deep, while far below them, the old
nightmares of earth would settle
into silt among the broken cities, the empty
basket of the child would float
abandoned in the seaweed until the work of water
unraveled it in filaments of straw,
till even that straw rotted
in the planetary thaw the whales prayed for,
sending their jets of water skyward
in the clear conviction they’d spill back
to ocean with their will accomplished
in the miracle of rain: And the earth
was without form and void, and darkness
was upon the face of the deep. And
the Spirit moved upon the face of the waters.

Marriage on earth seems such a counterfeit,Mere imitation of the inimitable:In heaven we have the real and true and sure.’Tis there they neither marry nor are givenIn marriage but are as the angels: right,Oh how right that is, how like Jesus ChristTo say that! Marriage-making for the earth,With gold so much,— birth, power, repute so much,Or beauty, youth so much, in lack of these!Be as the angels rather, who, apart,Know themselves into one, are found at lengthMarried, but marry never, no, nor giveIn marriage; they are man and wife at onceWhen the true time is: here we have to waitNot so long neither! Could we by a wishHave what we will and get the future now,Would we wish aught done undone in the past?So, let him wait God’s instant men call years;Meantime hold hard by truth and his great soul,Do out the duty! Through such souls aloneGod stooping shows sufficient of His lightFor us i’ the dark to rise by. And I rise.

This dog standing in the middle of the street,
tail stiff, fur bushy with fear, and a pedigree rabbit,
its neck broken and bleeding beneath his paws,
might have been forgiven or simply taken away 
and shot under different circumstances
and no one would have said much, except his owner
who’d gone out into the yard at the start
of the commotion, having been involved 
at other times with the dog’s truancies, and yelled,
“Bosco, Bosco, goddamnit!” but unavailing,
and everyone understanding that once more Bosco
had been taken over by the dark corner of his nature. 
But this other sentiment we shared as well: the man
Who’d raised the rabbit shouldn’t husband something
so rare and beautiful he couldn’t keep it
from the likes of Bosco.

You work with what you are given,
the red clay of grief,
the black clay of stubbornness going on after.   
Clay that tastes of care or carelessness,
clay that smells of the bottoms of rivers or dust. 
Each thought is a life you have lived or failed to live,   
each word is a dish you have eaten or left on the table.   
There are honeys so bitter
no one would willingly choose to take them.
The clay takes them: honey of weariness, honey of vanity,   
honey of cruelty, fear. 
This rebus—slip and stubbornness,
bottom of river, my own consumed life—
when will I learn to read it
plainly, slowly, uncolored by hope or desire?   
Not to understand it, only to see. 
As water given sugar sweetens, given salt grows salty,   
we become our choices.
Each yes, each no continues,
this one a ladder, that one an anvil or cup. 
The ladder leans into its darkness.   
The anvil leans into its silence.   
The cup sits empty. 
How can I enter this question the clay has asked?

1897



God of our fathers, known of old,
   Lord of our far-flung battle-line,
Beneath whose awful Hand we hold
   Dominion over palm and pine—
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget! 
The tumult and the shouting dies;
   The Captains and the Kings depart:
Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,
   An humble and a contrite heart.
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget! 
Far-called, our navies melt away;
   On dune and headland sinks the fire:
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
   Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget! 
If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
   Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,
Such boastings as the Gentiles use,
   Or lesser breeds without the Law—
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget! 
For heathen heart that puts her trust
   In reeking tube and iron shard,
All valiant dust that builds on dust,
   And guarding, calls not Thee to guard,
For frantic boast and foolish word—
Thy mercy on Thy People, Lord!

Every night, we couldn’t sleep. Our upstairs neighbors had to keep Dropping something down the hall— A barbell or a bowling ball, 
And from the window by the bed, Echoing inside my head, Alley cats expended breath In arias of love and death. 
Dawn again, across the street, Jackhammers began to beat Like hangovers, and you would frown— That well-built house, why tear it down?  Noon, the radiator grill Groaned, gave off a lesser chill So that we could take off our coats. The pipes coughed to clear their throats. 
Our nerves were frayed like ravelled sleeves, We cherished each our minor griefs To keep them warm until the night, When it was time again to fight; 
But we were young, did not need much To make us laugh instead, and touch, And could not hear ourselves above The arias of death and love.

Light at each point was beating then to flight,
The sapling bark flushed upward, and the welling
Tips of the wood touched, touched at the bound,
And boughs were slight and burdened beyond telling
Toward that caress of the boughs a summer’s night,
Illimitable in fragrance and in sound. 
Here were the blue buds, earlier than hope,
Unnumbered, beneath the leaves, a breath apart,
Wakening in root-dusk. When the air went north,
Lifting the oakleaves from the northern slope,
Their infinite young tender eyes looked forth.
Here all that was, was frail to bear a heart.

We were very tired, we were very merry—
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.
It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable—
But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,
We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;
And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon. 
We were very tired, we were very merry—
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;
And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,
From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;
And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,
And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold. 
We were very tired, we were very merry,
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.
We hailed, “Good morrow, mother!” to a shawl-covered head,
And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;
And she wept, “God bless you!” for the apples and pears,
And we gave her all our money but our subway fares.

The voice, because of its austerity, will often cause dust to rise. 
   The voice, because of its austerity, will sometimes attempt the representation of dust. 
   Someone will say, I can’t breathe—as if choking on dust. 
   The voice ages with the body. 
   It will say, I was shaped by light escaping from a keyhole. 
   Or, I am the shape of that light. 
   It will say, For the body to breathe, a layer must be peeled away. 
   It will say, What follows is a picture of how things are for me now. 
   It will say, The rose is red, twice two is four—as if another were present. 
   The dust rises in spirals. 
   It will say, The distance from Cairo to anywhere is not that great. 
   As if one had altered the adjustment of a microscope. 
   Or examined its working parts. 
   Possibly an instrument covered with dust and forgotten on a shelf. 
   Beside a hatbox and a pair of weathered boots. 
   The voice will expand to fill a given space. 
   As if to say, This space is not immeasurable. 
   This space is not immeasurable. 
   When held before your eyes. 
   And which voice is it says (or claims to say), Last night I dreamt of walls and courses of brick, last night I dreamt of limbs. 
   As you dream—always unwillingly—of a writing not visible and voices muffled by walls. 
   As if the question: lovers, prisoners, visitors. 
   The voice, as an act of discipline or play, will imitate other voices. 
   This is what I am doing now. 
   This is what I’m doing now. 
   The clock behind my back, its Fusée mechanism. 
   Voice one recognizes from years before. 
   Beneath water, hidden by a spark. 
   Here at the heart of winter, or let’s say spring. 
   Voice with a history before its eyes. 
   With a blue dot before its eyes. 
   History of dust before its eyes. 
   It will say, as if remembering, The letter S stands for a slow match burning. 
   On the table before me. 
   No numbers on this watch. 
   And I live in a red house that once was brown. 
   A paper house, sort of falling down. 
   Such is the history of this house. 
   It looks like this. 
   Looks just like this. 
   We think to say in some language.

How did the valentines age so fast? Most of the names are forgotten. Billy, Billy, Billy, Jill I think strangers sent them out like advertising hoping I'd surrender. But  Jill, Jill, Jill and Billy Bill, shared memories aren't easily kept. Secrets wash out of the ocean blank all over. I am sitting on a beach chair somewhere in the middle of the century, pretending  I remember a garden of broken banjos and butterflies, old movies. Valentines from Valentino, Notes from Norma. Worms and spiders thrown at waves. Box of my names, shut up.

The labeled bins on the California hillside
catch the glint and quarter-glint of passing cars.
Families pull up with their interesting trash
and start unloading: Here, sweetheart,
this goes over in Newspaper. The bundle
hits with a thud. Diet soda cans
spin almost noiselessly down, and the sun-
permitting bottles from a day’s pleasure
are tossed into Mixed Glass by the children
who like to hear the smash, unknowable, chaotic,
as matter greets itself and starts to change. 
What mystery is inside a thing! If we peered
into the bin, we could see it waiting there,
could believe everything is alive and specific
and personal, could tell by the tilt of one
bottle against the next that it’s difficult
to be singular, to have identity, to keep
an outline safe in the terrors of space.
Even the child knows this. Bye, bottle! she shouts,
tossing it in; and the bottle lies there
in the two o’clock position, temporarily itself,
before being swept into the destiny of mixture. . . 
And what if some don’t want to. What if some items
in the piles of paper, the orange and blue
envelopes from a magazine sweepstakes, numbers
pressing through the cloudy windows
with our names, some among those pale sheets curled
with moisture, would rather stay as they are.
It’s spring; we’ve thrown away mistakes—
tax forms, recipes, tennis-ball-sized
drafts of poems—that which was blank
shall be made blank again—but what if
that failed letter wants to be a failure,
not go back to pulp, and thought .. .
Or across the parking lot, where light insists
on changing the dull cans, a few cans don’t want
to be changed, though they should want to,
shouldn’t they, should want to be changed
by light, light which is called sweet reason,
honeyed, spectra, magnitude, light that goes
from the parking lot looking helpless
though it is matter that has been betrayed. . . 
All afternoon the bins are carried off
by those who know about where things should go,
who are used to the clatter the cans make,
pouring out; and the families, who believed change
would heal them are pulling away in their vans,
slightly embarrassed by that which refused . . .
The bins fill again with hard substances,
the hills bear down with their fugitive gold,
the pampas grass bending low to protect
what was briefly certain and alive with hope.

Depressed because my
book wasn’t nominated
for a gay award, 
I lie on my couch
watching—not listening to—
the O.J. trial. 
Byron, who senses
something’s wrong, hides under the
bed until Ira 
comes home, carrying
a bouquet of beautifully
wrapped tulips. I press 
the mute button. “This
is your prize,” he says. “Guess what
they’re called.” A smile in- 
voluntarily
overcomes my frown. “What?” “Red
Parade.” “That sounds like 
the name of an old
Barbie outfit,” I say. “That’s
exactly what I 
told the florist. And
you know what she told me?” “What?”
“When she was a girl, 
she turned her Barbie
into Cleopatra: gave
her an Egyptian 
haircut and painted
her nipples blue.” “How cool.” “Yeah,
but now she thinks that 
her doll would be worth
eight hundred dollars if she
hadn’t messed it up.” 
Once in water, the
tulips begin to unclench—
ten angry fists. Their 
colors are fierce, like
Plath’s “great African cat,” her
“bowl of red blooms.” Poor 
Sylvia, who so
desperately wanted awards,
and only won them 
after she was dead.
Byron jumps up, Ira sits
down and massages 
my feet. “You guys.” My
spirits are lifted by their
tulips, kisses, licks.

At first she thought the lump in the road
was clay thrown up by a trucker’s wheel.
Then Beatrice saw the mess of feathers:  
Six or seven geese stood in the right-of-way, staring
at the blood, their black heads rigid above white throats.
Unmoved by passing wind or familiar violence, they fixed
their gaze on dead flesh and something more, a bird on the wing.  
It whirled in a thicket of fog that grew up from fields plowed
and turned to winter. It joined other spirits exhaled before dawn,
creatures that once had crept or flapped or crawled over the land.  
Beatrice had heard her mother tell of men who passed
as spirits. They hid in limestone caves by the river, hooded
themselves inside the curved wall, the glistening rock.
Then just at dark they appeared, as if they had the power
to split the earth open to release them. White-robed, faceless
horned heads, they advanced with torches over the water,
saying: We are the ghosts of Shiloh and Bull Run fight! 
Neighbors who watched at the bridge knew each man by his voice
or limp or mended boots but said nothing, allowed the marchers
to pass on. Then they ran their skinny hounds to hunt other
lives down ravines, to save their skins another night from
the carrion beetles, spotted with red darker than blood,
who wait by the grave for the body’s return to the earth.
Some years the men killed scores, treed them in the sweetgums.
Watched a man’s face flicker in the purple-black leaves.
Then they burned the tree.  
Smoke from their fires
still lay over the land where Beatrice traveled. 
Out of this cloud the dead of the field spoke to her,
voices from the place where some voices never stop:   They took my boy down by Sucarnochee Creek.
He said, “Gentlemen, what have I done?”
They says, “Never mind what you have done.
We just want your damned heart.” After they
killed him, I built up a little fire and laid out
by him all night until the neighbors came
in the morning. I was standing there when
they killed him, down by Sucarnochee Creek.

1    The dragons on the back of a circular bronze mirror
      swirl without end. I sit and am an absorbing form:
      I absorb the outline of a snowy owl on a branch,
      the rigor mortis in a hand. I absorb the crunching sounds

      ice heaved up here and there twenty feet high.
      I absorb the moment a jeweler pours molten gold
      into a cuttlefish mold and it begins to smoke.
      I absorb the weight of a pause when it tilts
      the conversation in a room. I absorb the moments
      he sleeps holding her right breast in his left hand
      and know it resembles glassy waves in a harbor
      in descending spring light. Is the mind a mirror?
      I see pig carcasses piled up from the floor
      on a boat docked at Wanxian and the cook
      who smokes inadvertently drops ashes into soup.
      I absorb the stench of burning cuttlefish bone,
      and as moments coalesce see to travel far is to return.  
2    A cochineal picker goes blind; 
      Mao, swimming across the Yangtze River,
      was buoyed by underwater frogmen; 
      in the nursing home,
      she yelled, “Everyone here has Alzheimer’s!” 
      it blistered his mouth; 
      they thought the tape of erhu solos was a series of spy messages; 
      finding a bag of piki pushpinned to the door; 
      shapes of saguaros by starlight; 
      a yogi tries on cowboy boots at a flea market; 
      a peregrine falcon
      shears off a wing; 
      her niece went through the house and took what she wanted; 
      “The sooner the better”; 
      like a blindman grinding the bones of a snow leopard; 
      she knew you had come to cut her hair; 
      suffering: this and that:
      iron 26, gold 79; 
      they dared him to stare at the annular eclipse; 
      the yellow pupils of a saw-whet owl.  
3    The gold shimmer at the beginning of summer
      dissolves in a day. A fly mistakes a
      gold spider, the size of a pinhead, at the center
      of a glistening web. A morning mushroom
      knows nothing of twilight and dawn?
      Instead of developing a navy, Ci Xi
      ordered architects to construct a two-story
      marble boat that floats on a lotus-covered lake.
      Mistake a death cap for Caesar’s amanita
      and in hours a hepatic hole opens into the sky.
      To avoid yelling at his pregnant wife,
      a neighbor installs a boxing bag in a storeroom;
      he periodically goes in, punches, punches,
      reappears and smiles. A hummingbird moth
      hovers and hovers at a woman wearing a   
      cochineal-dyed flowery dress. Liu Hansheng
      collects hypodermic needles, washes them
      under a hand pump, dries them in sunlight,
      seals them in Red Cross plastic bags,
      resells them as sterilized new ones to hospitals.  
4    Absorb a corpse-like silence and be a brass
      cone at the end of a string beginning
      to mark the x of stillness. You may puzzle
      as to why a meson beam oscillates, or why
      galaxies appear to be simultaneously redshifting
      in all directions, but do you stop to sense
      death pulling and pulling from the center
      of the earth to the end of the string?
      A mother screams at her son, “You’re so stupid,”
      but the motion of this anger is a circle.
      A teen was going to attend a demonstration,
      but his parents, worried about tear gas,
      persuaded him to stay home: he was bludgeoned
      to death that afternoon by a burglar.
      I awake dizzy with a searing headache   
      thinking what nightmare did I have
      that I cannot remember only to discover
      the slumlord dusted the floor with roach powder.  
5    Moored off Qingdao, before sunrise,
      the pilot of a tanker is selling dismantled bicycles.
      Once, a watchmaker coated numbers on the dial 
      with radioactive paint and periodically
      straightened the tip of the brush in his mouth.
      Our son sights the North Star through a straw 
      taped to a protractor so that a bolt
      dangling from a string marks the latitude.
      I remember when he said his first word, “Clock”; 
      his 6:02 is not mine, nor is your 7:03 his.
      We visit Aurelia in the nursing home and find
      she is sleeping curled in a fetal position. 
      A chain-smoking acupuncturist burps, curses;
      a teen dips his head in paint thinner.
      We think, had I this then that would, 
      but subjunctive form is surge and ache.
      Yellow dips of chamisa are flaring open.
      I drop a jar of mustard, and it shatters in a wave.  
6    The smell of roasted chili; 
      descending into the epilimnion; 
      the shape of a datura leaf; 
      a bank robber superglued his fingertips; 
      in the lake,
      ocean-seal absorption; 
      a moray snaps up a scorpion fish; 
      he had to mistake and mistake; 
      burned popcorn; 
      he lifted the fly agaric off of blue paper
      and saw a white galaxy; 
      sitting in a cold sweat; 
      a child drinking Coke out of a formula bottle
      has all her teeth capped in gold; 
      chrysanthemum-shaped fireworks exploding over the water; 
      red piki passed down a ladder; 
      laughter; 
      as a lobster mold transforms a russula into a delicacy; 
      replicating an Anasazi
      yucca fiber and turkey-feather blanket.  
7    He looks at a series of mirrors: Warring States
      Western Han, Eastern Han, Tang, Song,
      and notices bits of irregular red corrosion 
      on the Warring States mirror. On the back,
      three dragons swirl in mist and April air.
      After sixteen years that first kiss 
      still has a flaring tail. He looks at the TLV
      pattern on the back of the Han mirror:
      the mind has diamond points east, south, west, north. 
      He grimaces and pulls up a pile of potatoes,
      notices snow clouds coming in from the west.
      She places a sunflower head on the northwest 
      corner of the fence. He looks at the back   
      of the Tang mirror: the lion and grape
      pattern is so wrought he turns, watches her 
      pick eggplant, senses the underlying
      twist of pleasure and surprise that
      in mind they flow and respond endlessly.  
8    I find a rufous hummingbird on the floor
      of a greenhouse, sense a redshifting
      along the radial string of a web.
      You may draw a cloud pattern in cement
      setting in a patio, or wake to
      sparkling ferns melting on a windowpane.
      The struck, plucked, bowed, blown
      sounds of the world come and go.
      As first light enters a telescope
      and one sees light of a star when the star
      has vanished, I see a finch at a feeder,
      beans germinating in darkness;
      a man with a pole pulls yarn out
      of an indigo vat, twists and untwists it;
      I hear a shout as a child finds Boletus
      barrowsii

A ward, and still in bonds, one day
     I stole abroad;It was high spring, and all the way
  Primrosed and hung with shade;
  Yet was it frost within,
     And surly windsBlasted my infant buds, and sin
  Like clouds eclipsed my mind.
Stormed thus, I straight perceived my spring
     Mere stage and show,My walk a monstrous, mountained thing,
  Roughcast with rocks and snow;
  And as a pilgrim’s eye,
     Far from relief,Measures the melancholy sky,
  Then drops and rains for grief,
So sighed I upwards still; at last
     ’Twixt steps and fallsI reached the pinnacle, where placed
  I found a pair of scales;
  I took them up and laid
     In th’ one, late pains;The other smoke and pleasures weighed,
  But proved the heavier grains.
With that some cried, “Away!” Straight I
     Obeyed, and ledFull east, a fair, fresh field could spy;
  Some called it Jacob’s bed,
  A virgin soil which no
     Rude feet ere trod,Where, since he stepped there, only go
  Prophets and friends of God.
Here I reposed; but scarce well set,
     A grove descriedOf stately height, whose branches met
  And mixed on every side;
  I entered, and once in,
     Amazed to see ’t,Found all was changed, and a new spring
  Did all my senses greet.
The unthrift sun shot vital gold,
     A thousand pieces,And heaven its azure did unfold,
  Checkered with snowy fleeces;
  The air was all in spice,
     And every bushA garland wore; thus fed my eyes,
  But all the ear lay hush.
Only a little fountain lent
     Some use for ears,And on the dumb shades language spent
  The music of her tears;
  I drew her near, and found
     The cistern fullOf divers stones, some bright and round,
  Others ill-shaped and dull.
The first, pray mark, as quick as light
     Danced through the flood,But the last, more heavy than the night,
  Nailed to the center stood;
  I wondered much, but tired
     At last with thought,My restless eye that still desired
  As strange an object brought.
It was a bank of flowers, where I descried
     Though ’twas midday,Some fast asleep, others broad-eyed
  And taking in the ray;
  Here, musing long, I heard
     A rushing windWhich still increased, but whence it stirred
  No where I could not find.
I turned me round, and to each shade
     Dispatched an eyeTo see if any leaf had made 
  Least motion or reply,
  But while I listening sought
     My mind to easeBy knowing where ’twas, or where not,
  It whispered, “Where I please.”
“Lord,” then said I, “on me one breath,And let me die before my death!”
  Cant. chap. 5. ver. 17
Arise O North, and come thou South-wind and blow upon my garden, that
the spices thereof may flow out.

Kurt, early
twenties. Met
him after
an AA
meeting in
Silverlake
(November,
eighty-five).
I remem-
ber standing
with him up-
stairs, in the
clubhouse, how
I checked his
body out.
But not who
approached whom.
Or what we
talked about
before we
leaned against
my car and
kissed, under
that tarnished
L.A. moon.
Drove to my
place and un-
dressed him in
the dark. He
was smaller
than me. I
couldn’t keep
my hands off
his ass. Next
morning, smoked
till he woke,
took him back.
He thanked me
sweetly. I
couldn’t have
said what I
wanted, though
must have known.
Drove home and
put him in
a poem
("November")
I was at
the end of. 
Later that
day it rained
(I know from
the poem).

Somewhere in Chelsea, early summer;
And, walking in the twilight toward the docks,   
I thought I made out Robinson ahead of me. 
From an uncurtained second-story room, a radio   
Was playing There’s a Small Hotel; a kite
Twisted above dark rooftops and slow drifting birds.   
We were alone there, he and I,
Inhabiting the empty street. 
Under a sign for Natural Bloom Cigars,
While lights clicked softly in the dusk from red to green,   
He stopped and gazed into a window
Where a plaster Venus, modeling a truss,
Looked out at Eastbound traffic. (But Robinson,
I knew, was out of town: he summers at a place in Maine,   
Sometimes on Fire Island, sometimes the Cape,
Leaves town in June and comes back after Labor Day.)
And yet, I almost called out, “Robinson!” 
There was no chance. Just as I passed,   
Turning my head to search his face,   
His own head turned with mine
And fixed me with dilated, terrifying eyes   
That stopped my blood. His voice
Came at me like an echo in the dark. 
“I thought I saw the whirlpool opening.   
Kicked all night at a bolted door.
You must have followed me from Astor Place.   
An empty paper floats down at the last. And then a day as huge as yesterday in pairs   
Unrolled its horror on my face
Until it blocked—”

God’s own best will bide the test     And God’s own worst will fall; But, best or worst or last or first,     He ordereth it all.  For all is good, if understood,     (Ah, could we understand!) And right and ill are tools of skill     Held in His either hand.  The harlot and the anchorite,     The martyr and the rake, Deftly He fashions each aright,     Its vital part to take.  Wisdom He makes to form the fruit     Where the high blossoms be; And Lust to kill the weaker shoot,     And Drink to trim the tree.  And Holiness that so the bole     Be solid at the core; And Plague and Fever, that the whole     Be changing evermore.  He strews the microbes in the lung,     The blood-clot in the brain; With test and test He picks the best,     Then test them once again.  He tests the body and the mind,     He rings them o’er and o’er; And if they crack, He throws them back,     And fashions them once more.  He chokes the infant throat with slime,     He sets the ferment free; He builds the tiny tube of lime     That blocks the artery.  He lets the youthful dreamer store     Great projects in his brain, Until He drops the fungus spore     That smears them out again.  He stores the milk that feeds the babe,     He dulls the tortured nerve; He gives a hundred joys of sense     Where few or none might serve.  And still He trains the branch of good     Where the high blossoms be, And wieldeth still the shears of ill     To prune and prune His tree.

After reading Ash Wednesday
she looked once at the baked beans
and fled. Luncheonless, poor girl,
she observed a kind of poetic Lent—
and I had thought I liked poetry
better than she did. 
I do. But to me its most endearing
quality is its unsuitableness;
and, conversely, the chief wonder in heaven
(whither I also am sometimes transported)
is the kind of baggage I bring with me. 
Surely there is no more exquisite jointure
in the anatomy of life than that at which
poetry dovetails with the inevitable meal
and Mrs. B. sits murmuring of avocados.

He had a back office in his older brother’s
advertising agency and understood the human asshole.
He turned his father’s small inheritance over and over
on hemorrhoid ads between three-hour lunches
at the Plaza every day and cocktails at five-thirty
with different dressy women waiting in our front office.
We joked that he fucked them up the ass to make more customers
and were nauseated by him because he picked his ears
with the lead end of his lead pencil as he argued and argued
hemorrhoid copy with us on nauseating Mad. Ave. mornings.
Why argue? It must have been for executive power-feelings
because the copy never changed. Every week, the poor
bleeding assholes bought the shit. When my mind
began to get fucked and go as black as his inner ears
I quit as broke as I began, remembering his prophecy:
that the last working television set in the world
would be showing a hemorrhoid ad for ANUSALL
at Armageddon, that it would have been written
by him, that he would be watching it at 6:00 P.M.
in the bomb-cellar lounge of the Park Plaza Hotel
with a blonde’s ass in one hand and a scotch in the other,
and that he would die happy, with his old man’s
money intact and his asshole too, unlike us prat-boys.

The fake Parthenon in Nashville, Stonehenge reduced by a quarter
near Maryhill on the Columbia, the little Statue of Liberty
taken from the lawn of the high school and not recovered
             for months,
Simon Rodia’s Watts Towers in the tile maker’s shape of a ship
to sail home in, the house in the shape of a ship near Milwaukee
where once before the river below rose up to swallow the bank,
World’s Fairs where one can enter the cell of a human body
or see Paris, London, Marrakech and the Taj Mahal in
             one afternoon,
the headache that may be sinus or bad eyes or allergy or a tumor,
the bruise that was blue now yellow the effect of labor or abuse,
the cataclysmic event in a personal life not totally forgotten,
the memory of doing well that turned to unexpressed anger
just because love was everywhere preventing helpless mistakes—
achievement and perfection for the first time considered in error,
the end of life being life itself, life itself ignorance,
we never tire of making the world smaller, looking in doll houses,
and a mailman who has picked up every bright piece of glass and tile
in forty years of rounds retired to build a house of glass and tile
which is his life, no kick coming, while in a suburb of Chicago
a leaning tower of Pisa drawn to scale signals a shopping plaza
where goods come in from around the world, for the people who
             live there.
And Vico says gods and goddesses are the self writ large—
selves to make earthquakes, tornadoes, eclipses, selves to lift the sun—
and Vico says all things having been named for the namers, us,
we give a chair arms, legs, a seat and a back, a cup has its lip
and a bottle its neck, and ever after rivers flow from their headwaters
and a well-oiled engine purrs at the center of good feeling.
So take your misery down a notch in aches and pains and
             little diseases,
in years of photo albums, in journals of dreams interrupted
             by mornings,
in furniture you built yourself, in copies and imitations,
in scale-model wars and families and the age of fancy automobiles.
And when once in your life you make the big trip to the original,
chances are you’ll mainly see your own face in the glass that protects
everything of which there’s one only in the form of its only maker.

for Shanshan



The wave of that year
flooded the sands on the mirror
to be lost is a kind of leaving
and the meaning of leaving
the instant when all languages
are like shadows cast from the west 
life's only a promise
don't grieve for it
before the garden was destroyed
we had too much time
debating the implications of a bird flying
as we knocked down midnight's door 
alone like a match polished into light
when childhood's tunnel
led to a vein of dubious ore
to be lost is a kind of leaving
and poetry rectifying life
rectifies poetry's echo

For whom the possessed sea littered, on both shores,
Ruinous arms; being fired, and for good,
To sound the constitution of just wars,
Men, in their eloquent fashion, understood. 
Relieved of soul, the dropping-back of dust,
Their usage, pride, admitted within doors;
At home, under caved chantries, set in trust,
With well-dressed alabaster and proved spurs
They lie; they lie; secure in the decay
Of blood, blood-marks, crowns hacked and coveted,
Before the scouring fires of trial-day
Alight on men; before sleeked groin, gored head,
Budge through the clay and gravel, and the sea
Across daubed rock evacuates its dead.

The man sits in a timelessness   
with the horse under him in time   
to a movement of legs and hooves   
upon a timeless sand. 
Distance comes in from the foreground   
present in the picture as time
he reads outward from
and comes from that beginning. 
A wind blows in
and out and all about the man   
as the horse ran
and runs to come in time. 
A house is burning in the sand.   
A man and horse are burning.   
The wind is burning.
They are running to arrive.

This prairie holds us
with its plainness.
An ugly wife.
We would not stay but children comfort us
and we need this flatness. 
On our table
a carp with a tumor
on its lip,
larva eating its side. 
An old man laughs,
one silver tooth
in his head
like a galvanized
watertank. 
We are driven back
into the land,
our raccoon faces
banded around the eyes
with motorcycle goggles.
Every car we had
rusting in the yard. 
We saddle the buffalo
and say we are captives.
This barrenness holds
us down like a wife.

I.
We hang clothes on the line.
His wide trousers and shirt, wind-beat,
roar small thunder from one prairie cloud. 
The same rapple of flag on its pole. 
Half in fear, half in jest, we laugh.
He calls us crow women.
Our black hair shines in the sun
and in the light from school windows. 
He drives his car to town, upsets the dust
on buckboard hills.
We sit on the fence when he is gone.
Does he know we speak of thunder in his shirts? 
We cannot do well in his school.
He reads from west to east,
The sun we follow moves the other way. 
Crowbar. 
Our eyes come loose from words on the page
in narrow rooms of the reservation school.
He perceives and deciphers at once. 
For us
written letters will not stay on the page,
but fall like crows from the sky and hit
against the glass windows of the school. 
Our day is night when we sit in rows of the classroom.
Leaves in a whirlwind from sumac groves.
Flock of crows are black starts on a white night. 
II.
On the porch of the reservation school
the blackbirds walk around our feet,
fly into our head.
They call our secret name. 
Dark corridors linger in our mind
We whisper the plains to one another. 
We do not talk of what we cannot understand.
Black and white fleckered dresses. 
Our face like our fathers. 
The sun is no enemy to the eye looking west.
The brush thin as hair of old ones. 
It blinds the eye, makes fire on fields,
flashes against windows like silver ribbons
on burial robes. 
Hot late into the fall, windy, ready for
cold to sweep in.
The heat seems solid, but totters on the brink
of winter. 
We laugh to ourselves when he returns to the
reservation school for girls.
Take his clothes from the line.
Set the table with salt and pepper, spoon, knives.
Cattails and milk-pods in a jar. 
We get lard from the basement,
rub a place in the dusty window like a moon in the ancient sky. 
III.
One hill larger than the others:
an old buffalo with heavy head and whiskers
nods at the ground,
grazes in my dreams, one blade at a time. 
We stay in our stiff white-sheeted beds in the
dormitory room.
Buffalo wander in our dreams. 
White night-dresses.
Black pods suspended in sumac groves like crows. 
In the sweat lodge of sleep
we make our vision quest,
black as pitch in crevice between crow feathers. 
We hang his thunder clothes in sleep,
arms reach above our beds like willows blowing slowly
by the creek. 
Quietly we choke,
hold our wounded arms like papooses. 
Clothes beat on lines.
Sumac groves and whirl of leaves:
a shadow of our fathers at council fires. 
Red leaves, waxy as hay on fields.
We dream of schoolrooms. 
Written letters on the wind. 
He reads crow-marks on the page but does not know
crow.

You that are dear, O you above the rest! Forgive him his evasive moods and cold; The absence that belied him oft of old, The war upon sad speech, the desperate jest, And pity’s wildest gush but half-confessed, Forgive him! Let your gentle memories hold Some written word once tender and once bold, Or service done shamefacedly at best, Whereby to judge him. All his days he spent, Like one who with an angel wrestled well, O’ermastering Love with show of light disdain; And whatso’er your spirits underwent, He, wounded for you, worked no miracle To make his heart’s allegiance wholly plain.

The names of things—sparks!
I ran on them like a component:   
Henries, microhenries, Blue   
Beavers, wee wee ductors:   
Biographer of small lives,
Of a plug and his girl named Jack,   
Of Utopian colonies which worked—
Steel, germanium, brass, aluminum,
Replaceables.
                   Outside, afloat, my words
Swung an arm charting the woman
Who was the river bottom. 
We tried, beyond work, at work,   
To keep what we loved. Near
Christmas I remember the office
Women trimming their desperately   
Glittering holy day trees. And,
Just as I left, the company
Talent show, the oils and sentiment   
Thick on still lifes and seacoasts,
The brush strokes tortured as a child’s   
First script. Someone
Had studied driftwood; another man,   
The spray of a wave, the mania
Of waters above torpedoes.

The strident high
civic trumpeting
of misrule. It is
what we stand for. 
Wild insolence,
aggregates without
distinction. Courage
of common men: 
spent in the ruck
their remnant witness
after centuries
is granted them 
like a pardon.
And other fealties
other fortitudes
broken as named— 
Respublica
brokenly recalled,
its archaic laws
and hymnody; 
and destroyed hope
that so many times
is brought with triumph
back from the dead.

Retired ballerinas on winter afternoons

    or climb four flights to back rooms
                                 in Westside brownstones   
               where faded playbill photos
                        fall peeling from their frames   
                            like last year’s autumn leaves

My gentle friend! I hold no creed so falseAs that which dares to teach that we are born For battle only, and that in this lifeThe soul, if it would burn with starlike power, Must needs forsooth be kindled by the sparks Struck from the shock of clashing human hearts. There is a wisdom that grows up in strife, And one—I like it best—that sits at home And learns its lessons of a thoughtful ease.So come! a lonely house awaits thee!—there Nor praise, nor blame shall reach us, save what love Of knowledge for itself shall wake at times In our own bosoms; come! and we will build A wall of quiet thought, and gentle books, Betwixt us and the hard and bitter world. Sometimes—for we need not be anchorites—A distant friend shall cheer us through the Post, Or some Gazette—of course no partisan—Shall bring us pleasant news of pleasant things; Then, twisted into graceful allumettes, Each ancient joke shall blaze with genuine flame To light our pipes and candles; but to wars, Whether of words or weapons, we shall be Deaf—so we twain shall pass away the time Ev’n as a pair of happy lovers, who,Alone, within some quiet garden-nook,With a clear night of stars above their heads, Just hear, betwixt their kisses and their talk, The tumult of a tempest rolling throughA chain of neighboring mountains; they awhile Pause to admire a flash that only shows The smile upon their faces, but, full soon, Turn with a quick, glad impulse, and perhaps A conscious wile that brings them closer yet, To dally with their own fond hearts, and play With the sweet flowers that blossom at their feet.

I should like to live in a sunny town like this
Where every afternoon is half-day closing
And I would wait at the terminal for the one train
Of the day, pacing the platform, and no one arriving. 
At the far end of the platform is a tunnel, and the train
Slows out of it like a tear from a single eye.
You couldn’t get further than this, the doors all opened
And the porter with rolled sleeves wielding a mop. 
Even if one restless traveller were to arrive
With leather grip, racquets under the arm,
A belted raincoat folded over the shoulder,
A fishing hat, and a pipe stuck in his mouth, 
There would be nowhere for him to move on to
And he would settle down to tea in the lounge
Of the Goat Hotel, doing yesterday’s crossword,
And would emerge later, after a nap, for a drink. 
You meet them in the bar, glassy-eyed, all the time.
They never quite unpack, and expect letters
From one particular friend who doesn’t write.
If you buy them a drink they will tell you their life history: 
‘I should have liked to live in a sunny town like this,
Strolling down to the harbour in the early evening,
Looking at the catch. Nothing happens here.
You could forget the ill-luck dogging you. 
‘I could join the Fancy Rat Society and train
Sweet peas over the trellised porch
Of my little slice of stuccoed terrace. I could
Be in time for the morning service at Tesco’s. 
‘I expect death’s like this, letters never arriving
And the last remembered failure at once abandoned
And insistent, like a card on a mantelpiece.
What might it be? You can take your choice. 
‘ “I shook her by the shoulders in a rage of frustration.”
“I smiled, and left the room without saying a word.”
“I was afraid to touch her, and never explained.”
“I touched her once, and that was my greatest mistake.” ’ 
You meet them before dinner. You meet them after dinner,
The unbelieved, the uncaressed, the terrified.
Their conversation is perfectly decent but usually
It slows to a halt and they start to stare into space. 
You would like it here. Life is quite ordinary
And the self-pity oozes into the glass like bitters.
What’s your poison? Do you have a desire to drown?
We’re all in the same boat. Join us. Feel free. 
And when the bar closes we can say goodbye
And make our way to the terminal where the last
(Or is it the first?) train of the day is clean and waiting
To take us slowly back to where we came from. 
But will we ever return? Who needs us now?
It’s the town that requires us, though the streets are empty.
It’s become a habit and a retreat. Or a form of justice.
Living in a sunny town like this.

Happy those early days! when I Shined in my angel infancy. Before I understood this place Appointed for my second race, Or taught my soul to fancy aught But a white, celestial thought; When yet I had not walked above A mile or two from my first love, And looking back, at that short space, Could see a glimpse of His bright face; When on some gilded cloud or flower My gazing soul would dwell an hour, And in those weaker glories spy Some shadows of eternity; Before I taught my tongue to wound My conscience with a sinful sound, Or had the black art to dispense A several sin to every sense, But felt through all this fleshly dress Bright shoots of everlastingness.        O, how I long to travel back, And tread again that ancient track! That I might once more reach that plain Where first I left my glorious train, From whence th’ enlightened spirit sees That shady city of palm trees. But, ah! my soul with too much stay Is drunk, and staggers in the way. Some men a forward motion love; But I by backward steps would move, And when this dust falls to the urn, In that state I came, return.

Cats walk the floor at midnight; that enemy of fog,   
The moon, wraps the bedpost in receding stillness; sleep
Collects all weary nothings and lugs away the towers,
The pinnacles of dust that feed the subway. 
What stiff unhappy silence waits on sleep
Struts like an officer; tongues next-door bewitch   
Themselves with divination; I like a melancholy oaf   
Beg the nightly pillow with impossible loves.   
And abnegation folds hands, crossed like the knees   
Of the complacent tailor, stitches cloaks of mercy   
To the backs of obsessions. 
                                  Winter like spring no less   
Tolerates the air; the wild pheasant meets innocently   
The gun; night flouts illumination with meagre impudence.
In such serenity of equal fates, why has Narcissus   
Urged the brook with questions? Merged with the element
Speculation suffuses the meadow with drops to tickle   
The cow’s gullet; grasshoppers drink the rain.   
Antiquity breached mortality with myths.
Narcissus is vocabulary. Hermes decorates
A cornice on the Third National Bank. Vocabulary   
Becomes confusion, decoration a blight; the Parthenon
In Tennessee stucco, art for the sake of death. Now   
(The bedpost receding in stillness) you brush your teeth
“Hitting on all thirty-two;” scholarship pares   
The nails of Catullus, sniffs his sheets, restores   
His “passionate underwear;” morality disciplines the other
Person; every son-of-a-bitch is Christ, at least Rousseau;
Prospero serves humanity in steam-heated universities, three
Thousand dollars a year. Simplicity, Flamineo, is obscene;
Sunlight topples indignant from the hill.
In every railroad station everywhere every lover   
Waits for his train. He cannot hear. The smoke   
Thickens. Ticket in hand, he pumps his body   
Toward lower six, for one more terse ineffable trip,   
His very eyeballs fixed in disarticulation. The berth   
Is clean; no elephants, vultures, mice or spiders   
Distract him from nonentity: his metaphors are dead. 
More sanitation is enough, enough remains: dreams   
Do not end—lucidities beyond the stint of thought.   
For intellect is a mansion where waste is without drain;
A corpse is your bedfellow, your great-grandfather dines
With you this evening on a cavalry horse. Intellect   
Connives with heredity, creates fate as Euclid geometry
By definition:
            
          The sunlit bones in your house   
          Are immortal in the titmouse,   
          They trip the feet of grandma   
          Like an afterthought each day.   
          These unseen sunlit bones,
          They may be in the cat
          That startles them in grandma   
          But look at this or that
          They meet you every way. 
For Pelops’ and Tantalus’ successions were at once simpler,
If perplexed, and less subtle than you think. Heredity
Proposes love, love exacts language, and we lack   
Language. When shall we speak again? When shall   
The sparrow dusting the gutter sing? When shall   
This drift with silence meet the sun? When shall I wake?
