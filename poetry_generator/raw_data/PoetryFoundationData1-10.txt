A pair of adolescent boys grabs a rabbit to shear off  its ears. It doesn’t matter why, whether they’re sad or from the city. What matters is what they do with their hands: hold the blade, hang the rabbit by its ears. But the rabbit says, “I met a truck-stop priest in Mississippi outside Books-A-Million, should I tell you what he said?” And the boys pause to consider, so he continues, “We sat into the night talking about anything: his gay ex-wife who practices witchcraft, masturbation with vacuum hoses, his fetish for boys’ leg hairs—like your own!” They giggle at this and scream, set the rabbit down, and listen. “The priest in his collar and cross necklace spoke, though his face transformed: he grew freckles where there weren’t any freckles; he grew beards where his chin was smooth; and his eyes were more ancient than all the lakes in Mississippi.” What did he say? What did he say? the boys demand, wanting to learn, more than anything. Continues the rabbit, “The faces spoke, not the priest, in voices that traveled to my brain. They taught me lessons. First, that every soul is a thread in a cloth that floats through black everything, sparkling like snow into a lake. So you, and I, and everyone we know are iterations of these souls, these cloths, some newly woven, and some old.” The boys: What else did the faces say?  The rabbit: “They said that they and I were of a single cloth, of the type who dies and rises again.” And what about us? What about us? demand the boys, and the rabbit jumps off the rock and runs because the boys hold a knife and can’t recognize a parable or my face, however human.

A change to my usual sleeping position,
earth holding me close
like I’m something that it loves.
I feel a murmur through the hedgerow,
old gods thawing from the permafrost.
Only a matter of time
before an Empire falls
into the hands of an idiot
and there are more ways of saying things
than things worth saying;
only a matter of  love to steer the wind,
which batters us daily, this only life
that climbs beyond unfashionable
beginnings, leaving us leaving it,
breathless software, a bite taken out
of the grand old narrative,
while our ghosts refuel midair.
Deep time. Lovely time.
The human print will not survive.
I mean like, woo, there it was.


^^EOP^^


I—the telltale animal—rest my throat
against the snare of you, offer my howl
to the black-eyed Susan in free will,
one fistful of yellow stubbing the chin
of never-never land. We try our best to
out the devil, to trace his foul-mouthed
lips that outline why we desire what we
loathe. It was your personhood that made
me lose hope—that prison system of a
language. I keep a pay phone in my living
room for you. It rings when I touch myself,
the nostalgic purpose of ill will. I am a marked
woman now. Nape backlit with you in shades
of blue, suffering the robe pity slips off at dusk.
I will always give you credit for such undressing. No—a form of never—clings like stringy meat to
peach pit. I have yet to love a man who has not
strangled me to death, has not tried to muzzle
want upon waking. If startled, I shout out
the names of gods or unborn babes, a once
upon a time of denials. I count black sheep
and wait for the sound of your touch.
These numbers are a nervous system.

Sauntering along, the boy looks up and sees a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.
—Alexander Gilchrist



I wake to the grayest, maddening light. Good morning. It is seven o’clock in London. 
What comprises the night? What conducts
the dark? The thing
worries for the thing. The houseboats on the River Lea
waver brightly in the shallows. In Roydon, a swan thinks the lake,
which doves—O Fama!—plunge to meet. What does it mean
when the footbridge continues into the forever-
fit of shadows? And the meadows, purpled like nothing else.
The what-is in the marshes. And the pink sky, shattered over Lewisham!
In another part of the city, my friends
break their fasts together
in London’s late, caliginous wash.
We have Chinese food in the dark
and, in the distance, foxes
wear the voices of the dying. 
It can’t be what it was. It can’t be
what it should. Like the hand that moves
the gate. Like the water
water moves—the trees giving way
to the place where the cliff breaches the mist
and my muses sputter at the edge. I wanted so much the highest river
and that single swan. I wanted the uncrying valley, white as white.
It could have been like this. It could have been
like this. It couldn’t. It could. And the blood bay horses grazing
as a schoolboy falls asleep beside me
and the train turns in the gloaming—
I said I wanted the clouds. I said I wanted
the dusk that isn’t dusk, but, instead, the thorny husk
of the thing that drives me. Madly, that shaking of the dust beneath the tracks
where a path leads to an alternate grove
and the metal un-beams itself and, yes, our incapacitable hearts— 
If  I were the lamb, I’d choose the block.
If  I were the horse that rode with you, I’d ride with you.
I don’t know how to write for the God
in whose voice I can only hear
my own sullied desperation. We stop at an empty station, old child of the fog.
The snakes look over us, my coffee-sweet, my lost-now ravishing,
my shaking in the black. My friend, the fates knew from the start.
O how it shakes. The mud of which we’re made—O how it. The summer,
it tore me—O, this spring, how I.
Like the day, like the swan, like my sacral lungs
gagging for the smog
on the way to Peckham Rye. And the wild humming of  Brockley Footpath
as we walk home beneath the huge, undefiable moon
and the terrors for which we were never prepared
fade into the night on the other side of the tunnel—
the dim-lovely, bitter, blank and powder, the dirt and whatever short
shreds of ourselves we lost among the hallows. Errant and unlit.
O how, howl, howling, my love that isn’t. Nunhead Cemetery
and my been-beaten chest. It was me all along. I don’t know.
When I got up to leave, I watched the curtains block the bastard light
until slowly, slowly, they forgot all about me,
glowing in the new day,
my shade against their blue, my back against his back.

After “Hecky Naw” by José Olivarez



you can take my breath
but the bruh stays
lips slapping spice
of unknown bulk
face curry-blushed
from its blandness
my dad’s face caved
sour into his nose
when he heard it
the bruh cliff-hanging
on his beard
I think he tries to pray the white out of me
Town and Country now
a sermon bench for
290 west lectures
where D & D
is a cult following
if  that’s the case
my dungeon master got me hypnotized
rolling d20s is life in a quick toss
my new friend group is wild
they got bruh in their structure
fingers type in the group chat
with the single syllable
smash
we duke it out in basements and
Ike’s aether always pops out our croaking throats
bruh
sometimes I want to falcon-punch life in the face
cause I can never find the rhythm
to lift my hand
place it on her waist
and hip the yuck out me
need to leave my house
can’t look at any direction without muttering
bruh
this word
should not be something I want
something that never leaves
the tongue of my brain
but I love the way it punches my chest
just wish it would punch me harder

It was the hard winter she came,
frozen larks plummeting through the gloam like falling stars,
each pail in the yard a slattern’s looking glass. 
Each dusk, the house cobwebbed by creeping frost,
my husband slipped like a knife from an oyster,
my sons nestled like dormice in their cots,
I stood at my black window and oh
the cold it pressed upon me like a lover,
held its hands to my throat, my knees. 
She came first through the trees:
a small glint amongst the poplars,
hoarfrost dripping from the velvet nubs of their antlers,
leaping fast to a shuddering pillar of flame,
her pelvis a cradle of jeweled tinder,
her ribs white kindling. A holy thing—
such furious unblossoming—and something profane. 
I pressed my eye to the glass, the crackling dark,
saw her heart catch light,
blackbirds flap frantic from the forks of trees—
    —woke shivering, sweat between my breasts,
my tongue in my teeth. 
Every night then she came
in the stolen hours between caring and dream,
the children vanished, the drudging chaos of day
put to sleep.
I have no words to tell of the shapes she scorched,
the frozen lock, the copper key,
but that heat licked me raw as a wild love,
cracked the ice on my ribs and tossed in a flare. 
All my life I have been a good woman,
compliant, neat, my children’s snow boots polished,
each snowflake of ash swept clean from my step.
I’ve worn obedience like a uniform,
the hoof of the iron cooling in my grate.
Yet I riled in the witching hour, tongue glittering. 
My darling, I whispered to my own dry bones,
for what do you burn? 
Three moons she has been absent,
though I wait at my window, the chill persisting, presaging snow,
and my longing rises hopeless as the carp in the pool.
I don’t know where she is living
or if she lives at all—
with women nursing in fevered sheets
or scrubbing floors until their knuckles ignite? 
But by dark, when my sons sail the black cut
of sleep, and frost lays its terrible lace
upon the grass, when I am alone with my fretting,
with my dreams like black pearls in the clam of my mouth,
I press my fists to that tenderest wound—my soul—
and Christ how I burn.

Somewhere ravens, or are they crows, say, “Ha ha,”
not the British ditch with fence, famous 
to Scrabblers, but a small horn’s notes, terse
and hoarse. A sheep’s bleat, a handsaw, 
the finches’ high-pitched chitter
in the blighted apple tree, its stalled 
tart fruit, red-bottomed, inch-wide, already timed
out: it all makes a music, animal, 
vegetal, human. One white morning glory
solos in the swath of optimist 
dandelions—nothing haunts
or hunts them, their dazzle-yellow boasts:  Hello, hello, we’re hiding’s counterpoise.
They border the moles’ 
two beige mounds and a hole.
Wild hemlock’s parsley-look 
also emblems the book of “seem,”
while the ground-dwelling flower 
with arrowhead leaves—no memorial
to the native tribes, Wiyots here 
or Ishi’s people further south—lures a bee,
a troth if not a promise: 
the flower, ale gold and blowsy,
has drunk beauty’s beer. 
Our only fence is the raven’s ha and ha:
air’s vowels, an LOL, or 
bravado’s call?
It’s what Yahweh boasts 
his battle horses say
in the Englished book of  Job. 
The ravens circle and call.
Even earth can seesaw 
when the fault slides right.
It’s raven heaven here.

one night, leaving your son’s makeshift bedroom in the loft
of the barn, in that first house I knew you in,
crunching through January’s snow back into your kitchen,
past dinner’s left-out dessert plates, then past the fireplace whose embers
still chittered like the chatting old sisters on the bus
I had taken here the day before, north, for eleven and a half hours—
a trip during which I sometimes crocheted what became
a rather long scarf for your son—then up the stairs past your bedroom,
to the guest room, up to the gables with its sloped ceiling
where waited the bed’s patchwork quilts, a painted comb, the lamp
you left on for me, and for some reason lost to time
a copy of Anne Frank’s The Diary of a Young Girl near enough—
maybe on a low bookshelf outside the room?—near enough
for me to choose it, and once under the covers I was awake
from start to finish with Dear Kitty, again, with the Epilogue, again,
though I felt I was reading it for the first time, or more like
I was a tree to which a bird returns and this time sees
the branch on which it will make its nest, and so I understood—
because being told of your death I want to parse all I have learned from you—
I understood we were to have some experiences many times in our lives
if we were lucky, but we would live them each time differently,
which seems obvious now, but then I was sixteen and didn’t know,
I didn’t know that each experience wasn’t just the first of identical ones to
    come,
like a rack of same dresses, and for that reason I thought
the mother of men I loved would all be like you, and all their sons
as kind as he, and that the journey between barn and house on a winter
    night
would always show a spray of constellations that would connect
all I was feeling with the goodness of the earth, also turning.

What about days when you feel nothing.
Waiting in the car, relative arbitration,
pigeon-pewter or urinal-cake sky, whatever.
A man shouting, a parade of missiles... 
You chew the food and harvest thoughts
from a seafloor. Control subject,
a raincoat blurred in close-circuit resolution,
you pinch the nerveless gummy flesh 
of  your elbows and fail to love well.
You try to carry a flag, at least,
in the distance. This is not sickness.
This is not anything. Hand gripping 
the big knife cutting onions. You could
cut fifty onions this way. You could sleep
until Easter. Maybe the fog will have lifted
by then and time will not seem to pass 
like small bones being broken in order.
What’s that sound? Bald human instinct,
pounding on the windows like a fly. Who am I? All blown open, paper fold, 
you cannot stop the living obligations,
debts abstracting in neutral waves.
Please come back. Patient hearts
are lining up along the shore.

Gallagher came down my steps on a darkening August evening,
in need of hot whiskey, lemon, sugar and cloves. A jaunty sailor’s cap
on his bald head, long nailed toes in sandals, warm embrace. 
He carried a faded Quinn’s supermarket bag that bulged with two
blue lobsters, fresh from lobster pot and seaweed curtained
hollows under rocks, angry claws clamped by red rubber bands. 
Moving antennae interrogated my smiling, greedy face.
Brave and warmed by whiskey, I dropped the biggest into
a cauldron of  boiling water, poked raised claws with spoons 
and looked away, saw his expression. He knew I couldn’t
watch those questioning antennae turn from blue black to red,
that I was glad lobsters have no voice that any human ear can hear. 
We drank more whiskey. He went home to hungry dog and fire.
Left me with memories of a wild river salmon he once brought,
a small child’s size and weight, wrapped in newspaper, 
silver scales and dead eyes. He slit the silver belly,
left liver and guts in the sink, scrapped away silver scales.
My fish kettle fitted the salmon as close as any human coffin. 
My mother died one spring. That first Christmas Eve, he brought
shrimps from pots he’d pulled in Curragh cove, translucent brown
bodies twitched under seaweed blankets. We sat close to the fire, 
curtains drawn against wind, rain and ghosts. Peeled pink, boiled
shrimps, threw shells into the fire, drank tea and whiskey.
Butter melted over our fingers as we swallowed shrimps on bread.

On the blacktop, along the track, against

One of the first experiments we give children teaches the three states of water: liquid, vapor, and ICE at the border storing children in hieleras, short-term detention facilities known as iceboxes because it’s so cold you can see your breath as it transforms from vapor into liquid and ice.

Why? a child on the floor asks.

Our bodies are mostly water and the water inside them is the same temperature as our bodies, around 98.6 degrees, but the icebox is much colder so when a child exhales a warm, saturated breath, it becomes dew, and when it is cooled even further, condenses to minuscule droplets of liquid and ice, and this, child, is the cloud we see.

Some children are given two apples a day, which helps them keep time.

When it comes to the human bones, it’s hard not to admire the rib cage that holds my heart like it’s an animal.

Still, if I had to name just one favorite, I’m torn between the hip and the jaw.

Imagine the invention of the wheel and then the waterwheel, the color wheel, the spinning wheel for turning threads into blankets.

Next lesson: there are five basic needs—water, air, food, sleep, shelter.

I admire the moving parts.

The evolution of the hip decoupled walking from breathing so we can run at sunset toward each other or away from fire.

The bones of the hips are winged; if I flashed a picture quickly before you like pornography, you might mistake it for an emperor moth, which is one way to enter the world, headfirst through a body attracted to light.

The history of hips frees the hands for holding a baby, rocking a baby, holding your child’s eyes near your eyes at the distance the eyes first can see.

The jawbone gives us each a face.

Not seen for a decade, diver of lupine, horsemint, vetch in the high meadows
    of the coast
and Sierra-Cascade ranges, 190 miles south to north, from Mount Shasta to
    Roseburg, OR, 
rarest of bumble bees, with the flamboyants—Wandering Skipper, Gabb’s
    Checkerspot,
Sonoran Blue, Santa Monica Mountains Hairstreak, California Dogface 
(my father caught them, collected into cellophane envelopes each pair of
    wings hinged to dry
bodies, from the Sierras, the meadows above Tahoe his mother painted, the
    lake 
a jag of sea-green blue through maize and ochers in her landscapes, after
    she stopped
playing the violin and tired of her sister’s theosophy; for years all I had of
    his was a cigar box 
of light, all this to keep from sliding into darkness, each thing saved part of
    a constellation,
one chip of  light necessitating the next one’s proximity, forming an outline 
someone will trace again and again, into wing or antennae, or hive, or a
    storm of bees
from a hollow, from the retreat of another form back into darkness,
    through a vent, 
underground, and my father, gone for longer than my daughters’ lives,
    floats somewhere, talking
to me, whispering my wrongs, my failures, each syllable a bit of dust from
    wings), 
the disappearing Frosted Elfin and Karner Blue, Mitchell’s Satyr, Taylor’s
    Checkerspot.
Who was Gabb or Taylor or Karner, to have their names attached to a streak
    of blue, 
brushed flakes of cerulean, or orange, or drab brown; or Franklin, who
    noticed
the solid black abdomen or the gold U on the anterior of the thorax, 
cohabitant on this range with the Western bumble bee, itself rare, and what
    we know
pinned to balsa wood, through abdomens, a bee or wasp, 
a solitary zebra-stripe, above milkweed, vetch, or top-heavy goldenrod
netted and gassed, how quickly the last ones are with us 
then not, a specimen tray in a cabinet pulled out, rows of  bodies, wings
    flared mineral
light, chitin brittle as pressed leaves. Pollinators, foragers. Signals of  
    summer’s height, the race 
of wildflowers blooming before the dry grass fires. In a season, to spawn,
    wrap in self-made
husks, then unfold, moist, and float up toward the sun or nest and lay the
    colony 
over the summer, queen and workers, caretakers of the burrow, foragers,
    and autumnal queens
to wait through winter laden with the future, laid on a mound of nectar, in a
    cup of wax. 
This year the cherry-tree had no fruit—or if there was, it was high in the
    tree, out of sight—
no bees meticulous in their work, the tree was silent all spring and summer. 
(Perhaps my father sought to find a Lepidoptera not yet named, in New
    Guinea or Borneo, something
mistaken for sky leaded between the tree canopy, but found none unknown— 
or this would be my story, since he told nothing of time, his time in the war,
    working
the wounds, the tropic diseases, like most who returned, slowly from their
    theaters of conflict, 
in silence, so turned to growing orchids, Phalaenopsis, white moth-orchids,
    dozens on a spray,
he would cross, hoping some new variant would take, our house filled then
    with possibility.) 
One monarch drifted over the scattered milkweed plants. A cool spring and
    summer, warm
fall, the absence of dragonflies over the meadows and warm lawns. So I
    think of the entomologist 
waiting in the August meadows of Mt. Ashland where he found the last
    Franklin bumble bee
and has come back each year to look again, his specimen box holds three,
    pinned, in the light 
their thorax bristles golden as though always stained by pollen shaken loose
    by their thrum in C,
sorting across scents and chromatics, compounding the nectars, mortal
    pollens. 
Does one know one is the last, no one answers, or there are no others on the
    path
across the wildflower meadows of Mt. Ashland, or no path, the last ones
    along it have been gone 
for a season or two, the last one a leftover cell deep in a vole’s lair, or a
    half-buried fox, sun-
warmed from sleep’s knots. If gone, who would miss them—someone,
    searching for one 
like a word hovering just beyond the tongue, its meaning he shapes with his
    hands, something
infirm, shapeless, “you know what I mean,” just to keep the conversation
    going or return it 
to where we were, start again, a memory, you are still pitch-perfect, a  
    middle-C to tune
the rest by, or is it an A, the oboist’s, then picked up others, that dis- 
ease you refuse to talk about, it can’t be you, to be the last one to remember
    this and then
no one afterward to call it back, say its name as you gently cup the stunned bee 
to show the golden U, in moments it is released, groggy, knowing it must
    find its way, picking
its alphabet back from vetch, lupine, horsemint, to bone-hollowed-hive.

Those lovely eyebrows were lifted high,
and those lips like a pomegranate’s insides
were pressed against Death!
—“Nongae” by Byeon Yeong-ro, translated by Mia You



Every origin story
          comes with embellishments,
and since my mother is now
          well over 40 I can tell you that
when I lay in wait in her uterus,
          pink velour lining and clots
of  melancholic sex around me,
          I could see already what the world
would give me, and I knew those gifts
          wouldn’t make my life easy. 
When she started to push
          I twisted the fabric
of  her cunt around my fingers
          and dragged all of it out with me
onto the pink polyester of
          her lap, the bedsheets,
the midwife’s gloves,  O, I only wanted my father to love me. 
That’s what a baby cries
          so we know it’s healthy.
That’s what I sighed last night
          so you could feel pity.  O, you aim at my belly,
but I aim to please. 
As my mother sat in heaps
          around me, I gathered her
needle and knife and unwound
          the strings from the lyre I’ll soon
strip for cartilage. I promise you
          I’ll fix this, I sang to my father,
through our secret,
          four-digit code. 
The television begins to play
          Cinderella, the calla lilies display
romance as filial piety, the market
          smells of crab and patent leather.
The women across, above, and
          beneath me methodically
ladle carbon and melodrama
          into steel bowls too warm
for bare hands. But here,
          my pink gloves, you might call them
an inheritance, I’ll sell them to you
          if  you tell a good story.
I’ll sell them to you if you tell me
          there’s no way out of this.
I’ll sell them to you
          if  you tell me you love me. 
The bone of my chin
          will shelter you in the evening,
my eyelids will embrace you
          whenever you need solace,
the bridge of my nose
          will lead you home.
My body is branded with
          luxury and chrysanthemums,
and I have no commitment
          to authenticity. Take this
cellular cream and rub it
          deep into the sky, you’ll see
the moon will shine for us
          just as brightly.  O, you’re all I’ve been looking for
          and all I’ve ever had,
you’ve taken everything from me
          because what’s sweeter than promise.
Our interest lies far
          beyond that horizon, and you’ll pay later, I whisper so gently.
          Don’t worry yourself about the river,
its name means “sorrow,” or “other,”
          but that’s just the packaging
and paperwork to my sincerity. 
Here, lean in,
          wrap your legs around me,
I’ll lick your intestines like
          a lollipop laced with plutonium.
I told you, I aim to please. 
That contraction you’re feeling,
          it’s the gift my mother gave me,
it’s the debt to you I’ve let grow
          and grow. O, I’m in you now,
don’t you see, and while you push
          I’m twisting my fingers through you.
These lines are my rings,
          they can’t be undone, you didn’t know how much
          I wanted you to love me. 
Every happy ending
          comes with disfigurements,
but for ours I’ll be the mirror
          to your beauty. Look down,
you see them all, don’t you,
          all the gifts the world
has promised you. It was I
          who fixed this for you, it was I
who led us here, right to the edge
          of the cliff—  Now we jump
into that white abyss—

All we ever talk of is light— let there be light, there was light then,  good light—but what I consider
dawn is darker than all that. 
So many hours between the day
receding and what we recognize 
as morning, the sun cresting
like a wave that won’t break 
over us—as if  light were protective,
as if  no hearts were flayed, 
no bodies broken on a day
like today. In any film, 
the sunrise tells us everything
will be all right. Danger wouldn’t 
dare show up now, dragging
its shadow across the screen. 
We talk so much of  light, please
let me speak on behalf 
of  the good dark. Let us
talk more of how dark 
the beginning of a day is.

Finn’s blue hands pulled pale sugar beet from mud
in cold cliff fields for many months a year. 
At times it snowed, often it rained. Sea winds raved,
sometimes rippled dark green sugar beet leaves. 
He scowled. We were fourteen years old. 
His thin lips tight. His white face clenched
against cold, clips round the ear, hard words. 
His father’s tweed jacket frayed at the cuffs,
hung over the top of his Wellington boots. 
A tough man, they said of his father.
Hard as nails that man. 
I skirted around his father’s fields, searched
for early primroses on south facing banks, 
carried my yapping dog out of the mud,
gazed out to sea, pretended I didn’t see Finn. 
Yesterday I saw him for the first time in fifty years,
sitting lopsided on a barstool in An Seanachai. 
His pinched boy’s face flabby from years
of whiskey drinking next to warm pub fires.

I offer you a cup of tea made from the roses that survived the bomb, honeyed inside a porcelain cup painted with roses the bees would go wild over if they could see the color red or feel its electric field.

The ether, I say, seems to me to be embodied in the scent we inhale so the tea, when we are away from the garden, will remind us to breathe.

The flowers are earthed, but the air around is charged with one hundred volts for every meter above the ground: the pollen leaps from the flower when the bee buzzes near the way the thorn beckons our finger toward it even though we know there will be a welling of blood.

It’s electric.

I hum, Where are you going my river, my river, where are you going? To the sea, to the sea.

Before the garden, a woman read my tarot from a deck of her own making: my past is a grave reflected in mirrored sunglasses, a headless soldier, a toilet after a party, but she says, if I get through a series of three places—a mountain,  a city in fog, a long river by raft—I will meet the two-thousand-pound wax man of judgment and, after that, find a place at last to rest my head.

In the middle, there’s a body with a hole at the head and at the heart and at the part of a woman that looks like a shell and underneath the first card I pulled: a shell she says could be emptiness or entry; I see, I say, like a flower.

Before I go, she asks me to write down my shame so I write, didn’t ask the question, and drop it in the anonymous box.

Like me, the bees are attracted to blue and see it like Monet does: deep and watery.

I’m wearing a shirt with a bunch of mixed-up letters and nearby another woman shouts, What is it?

It has to say something!

There are the letters, H, A, N ...

T.S. Eliot writes, in a note about the tarot cards read in The Waste Land, that the Hanged Man is associated in his mind with the Hanged God, which has to do with a ritual of sacrifice.

Something must be destroyed in order for something else to grow, the theory goes.

Of the fun facts about shame I’m handed, I’m attracted to to be shameless is to play God. 

Quick, boys!

The bombs are falling and you can save just one thing, what is it?

The roses.

Hybridists know each bloom is tender, born from crossing, so they sent the seeds overseas.

The garden we walk is an asylum for roses too rare for erasure.

Before and after, Eliot’s poem on the rose garden ends.

We played hangman one night to unravel a ladder; you look at me now in recognition and speak softly, Oh, HAPPINESS.

It’s been there all along on my chest.

What’s invisible to us the bees use to bind.

An erasure of George Meredith’s “Martin’s Puzzle”



Book, how well I understand
your gladness. 
Suffer’d a fool. 
Why heart? 
Well, the human fist
can be designed with a savouring. 
Why taste the books
of turns? 
I never solve
crush’d complaining. 
Thanks leave
wonderful body hymns. 
Fingers only
ask. 
Answer this: Should it select eyes
fixed on eye? 
So, Book, what must injustice
again mark? 
Engines permit tools. 
Respect may perhaps bow
but I instead question. 
Made together, the sky. 
Stop discord properly. 
A universe from heaps,
kneeling.

He carved faces into the dead parts of cedars.
He wore a belt of chisels around his waist. 
To determine where they were dead,
he took a leafless limb, followed it like thread 
back to its spool, down the corresponding strip of trunk.
In the middle of those woods, where the ground 
sloped into a large bowl, mist often got trapped,
parted at our calves. We walked together for a long time, 
and as we walked, he traced what I said
back to my left breast, down to the tender hole 
where I was once attached to my mother
until I went silent. Then, he braced my back 
against a tree. He took out a chisel and kneeled.
You ask when I stopped shouting everything 
and started keeping language close to my mouth
as if  I were reading to a match that had to last my life. 
Well it was not that day. That was much later,
after the trees had all been cleared and the earth 
leveled. When I stopped begging to be believed
and started telling the truth—no man was there.

For Cornelia Spelman and Reginald Gibbons



Perhaps dream figures of fire and wind
Spirit-being gathered up in human being momentarily
More than flesh and flashy garments
More than supper and skin of many colors
More than meat and raiment. 
Age, gender, race, hue, aristoi, data to discard
After when and why and wise—identity on earth, momentous momentarily
Who you are is who you are—a-blaze
Inside, a-bloom, a-risen, all the ages
You have ever been remember
All the stories you were ever told
All the stories you ever told
All the songs you ever heard sung
All the songs you could barely hum
All of these winding around inside you
Like a choir of remembrance. 
Blood of heritage               blood of spirit
Promise and delay,     clamoring
Stammering child, weeping woman,
Howling, crying man, talking baby,
Blood of heritage,          blood of spirit. 
Injuries, slights, neglects, abandonments
Assaults, bruises, all the hurts you have
Endured, survived and did not
But took inside, these are you
As much as the fire leaping up and out
And the wind spinning round, delight, and comfort, succor
And hilarity, a-trembling 
Soul-piece, God-lamp, heart pumping red
Blooded blue blood true blood round
Bone of bones, bone of honor, bone of strength,
Backbone connected to the wise head bone connected
Through the body bones to bones all connected
More than themselves 
All the feelings felt recur
Course through thoroughfares
Of thought, riding and gently
Twinkling like little lights, strung
Around, around through
Until the mind breaks with love
Or worrisome need, desire is a firework
Opening up this moment into a thousand thousands. 
And then more than that or this
More than words or images
An invisible indelible indivisible
Infinite beyond age the numeral
Or gender the sex or wish or race
The wise or myth or class the money or
No money or manners or hue the grades
Of color or aristoi the steps above
Below more than concept or conceit,
Food and clothing, elusive as freedom-need and justice,
Belief or disbelief, the presence of awe,
And awesome, awful and discrete, replete
And contiguous, night and noon at once
And more than anything we can name now or then or
Once, more than meat and raiment, far far
More than, 
And then there will be more for you.

Was it steady, a drizzle, a trickle under the door?
People with their cloaks over their heads, dodging,
the donkey’s back bright with wet? 
Or did it whip and howl and everyone bolted their doors
and ate hot soup, then held their breaths
making love, one eye on the window? 
The first, a dull, mechanical disaster: Who left the faucet on?  The second, Shakespearean: Fortune brings in some boats that are not steered.  
You don’t have to be an animist to believe
that weather is God standing on your roof
when your every veil around you sinks, 
or your boy, hit by a wrong sawn board,
floats face down. The dripping—
that’s Hitchcock, the swells swelling, 
the rusting swords, Noah hoarse,
every pinprick of a shower
triggering stress.

Abstract for a happy poem



You made your students write stories about happiness and they were, you said, the worst stories of the year. Remember the pregnant woman? in a Fontainebleau café, I meant to reset it in America when I wrote the poem, she was sordid with mammalian culmination, dissatisfied with the first table she chose, the chair, with too much too hot sun soaking her through the picture window, she gathered crockery, groceries, her unsatisfactory handbag in order to move but the space between tables was small and the deadweight of  her near-term baby in the moonbounce of  her body made her clumsy, trip, fall, splash, and spill her au lait into a man’s open laptop.
 
His screen went blank. She broke into tears. Him so angry and sorry for her he couldn’t speak. He lifted the milk-glopped computer out of the coffee; it dripped viscous stalactites onto the table and his knees and the floor, pooling around tasseled, perforated loafers. The woman at the end of  her tether. Tears dribbled down her face to her blouse and into the now-empty cup she swooped over to pick up nearly losing her balance. That happens pregnant: you forget for a minute and the front weight shocks you. The man, scrunched up in an expensive embroidered sweater, navy, thread beads, intricate, abstract in pattern, with thighs to make you think of sex, was heavy too with urgency to save circuitry, get back to his important work, money work, stocks work, smoke-and-mirrors work, rather like poetry, without forgiveness or incivility. His earpiece lighting up with calls he didn’t take.
 
Somebody in the background mumbled about Marine Le Pen ... Someone I think said something about the poor quality of the produce at the Intermarché Super et Drive, for C’est affreux! they said knowing and happily, tapping a newspaper. Euro! somebody spat, still grinding that axe. Somebody asked the waiter for l’addition who said if you are hiking in the forêt there is a hunt—chasse—in progress—en cours. Story and wound, deer, wild boar, trampling the underbrush. We peeped into lives made interesting by our watching. We at least (a happy part) were content. Note to self: put in some exquisite lines about the light in the forest, the openness between trees.
 
Pregnancy (unwanted, wanted, each kind harasses for all except the super-confident) and affluence meeting over coffee, ambition, and hormones. Some business of apology and napkins as coffee dripped milkily from table to floor and he finally moved his feet. What happened next: did she find a seat? Did his computer recover? Their faces hardly in motion. None of the shock of the scream of formation fighter jets but an army cargo plane bumbled low in the sky above the café, a cache of what in its belly? The very deepness of its gray. The man, the pregnant woman, looked up. The story stops there. Could be a meet cute. Or everything falls apart. My student wanted to know if the girl in the Hemingway story decided to get an abortion or not. “I like closure,” she said. The woman has no ring. So, what if he falls in love with her maternal body, discovers fatherhood’s more important than work, while she—what? Now everything plots without them 2... You see how gravid cancels the imagination, renders mother an instrument for other characters’ moral and emotional development, cancels a story trying to become about guns, money, and war. After all, they were only two people wordless with reaction, moving unknowable even to themselves, nothing due them but some final punctuation

With a nod to Maggie Nelson



I think you overestimate
the maturity of adults.
If a man who thinks he
is a king is mad, a king
who thinks he is a king
is no less so. Heavy is
the lighthead that crowns
before the leaves loosen.
Beneath the mask of
a father is a grapefruit,
a boy in fear of his own
fingers. From fear’s fetus
comes the notion of grati-
tude. We are indebted
even before we are born.
My occasional chin hairs
are masculine plural.
Because our tongues are
a violent pink and I cannot
speak of blood without
teeth. Because I never
learned how to whistle
and I can’t seem to kick
this body, I have adopted
this brittle lake of truth.
On one hand sits a song,
on the other my father
eats a bird.


^^EOP^^


My mother says I sure was heaven-sent
& determined on making her life hell—
cried every afternoon, & not one spell
worked. She rocked, she sang, made all the attempts
of  too-young mothers. Don’t they say the scent
of  a mother’s neck, & her voice, soothe well?
The familiar heartbeat’s supposed to tell
the story of the womb. Not how it went.
Until one day she put me in a chair
with a newspaper to tear out & toss
into a water bucket. Algebra
or God happened (quiet, I tore), & where
does it end? She recognized it, this loss,
she swears, the morning I was born. She saw. 
She swears the morning I was born she saw
the dishes stacked, though the news wasn’t dry.
The war brought the dead, the mothers the cries
of newborns. The militias made the laws:
cross here, here stop, here knock, here dance, here draw
a card—spades or hearts? Your fate does not lie
in your hands or the Almighty’s. The eye
of the gun is multi-pupiled. Blah blah
went the angels, though they watched over us,
didn’t they? Or did we come to our aid?
Some smoked. Where’s the crossword? asked the grandpas.
Everyone smoked, blamed each other, the bus,
& every pregnant woman was afraid
she’d soon be in labor, all back & jaws. 
I’d soon be in labor, all back & jaws,
though less after the epidural. God
bless the anesthesiologist! No rod
of in pain you will, your unholy laws.
Stab my spine painless or I’ll dig my claws
into your jugular. Don’t you applaud
the sacrifice of mothers, don’t you God
them. Altars are for the dead, & rage gnaws
at us: we’re badass, & what we want? We
know. & we don’t know. None of your business.
Both times I prayed for a girl, & intent
birthed them, as it did my mother & me;
we’re our own expulsion—& genesis,
moments later. We begin our descent. 
Moments later, we began our descent
down the building stairs. There was no shelter;
we hid in the school next door. We entered,
played with the older kids, who sometimes lent
us their Risk game set. Confused, we still went
with it. We loved the colors, & better,
the dice. We rolled. Hunched into our laughter,
we counted losses. My mother’s lament
came not from missiles, but from sudden news
of her brother’s death. He, countries away,
engineer, hit his head on the cement.
She’d seen him in a dream. How does God choose
when to show us, when to keep us at bay?
She saw her brother’s face, saw herself  bent. 
She saw her brother’s face. We saw her bent
over his photo, or a soapy plate.
Heard her light her last cigarette so late
it was early. Morning, between the rent
& electricity, to what extent
does one have time to mourn? Who derails fate,
peace? The only train I’d seen didn’t wait—
abandoned in the city grass, content
in the apocalypse. I spent most days
on the balcony: next door, the immense
emptiness of the archbishopric called.
I imagined running in the always
of its sun-flood until mother’s voice pressed.
I tied my blue laces, postponed my awe. 
I tied my blue laces, & to my awe,
it never worked. I loved September best:
without fail, rain—the clear illusionist—
fell on the first day of school, always brought
the earth with it: the soil’s fragrance rose raw
even in the alley. We chewed fast, lest
our mom find out what we’d bought with the rest
of our money. Remember? The hurrah
as we quickly ate the cake-filled brioche?
& the rotary phone? & my love for
new stationery, my fear of chamois
shoes? Tights torn, soaked, too whole-hearted, too gauche,
too rushed. I tried to hide it all before
we walked in, but tying my shoes, she saw. 
I walked in & she tied my shoes. She saw
the dirt, & sometimes shouted. But she let
me find & lose my Edens, alphabet
after alphabet. When boredom would gnaw,
she said, Read the dictionary. No flaw
in scarcity, if the mind wills. Duet
of  languages, thank you. Thank you, cassette,
& TV ads—I memorized them all.
Today she called, said her mother isn’t
dying. Perhaps she should? Didn’t she wolf
most her days? Enough. She can’t invent
excuses for her again. She wasn’t
kind. She dreaded the visit, thinking of
how the whole day would go. & still she went. 
How the whole day would go, & how it went
depended on the inflatable boat,
the cold river, the warm mountain, its coat
of marguerites, & our careful descent
into the summer morning. We’d no tent,
too young to camp, happy to be remote
from parents & the city. An old goat
grazed, & it strangely lightened my torment,
my fear of the wild. Then you turned—did you?
In a lost diary, a girl writes this; We walked off, briefly, but alone at least.
The others set the picnic, called. I knew.

^^EOP^^


                 But I could not hide
My quickening inner life from those at watch.
They saw a light at a window now and then,
They had not set there. Who had set it there?

^^EOP^^

All day, I feel the approach of dolphins; their thoughts are in my mind. 
When I swim, my cells attune to them, because ocean’s full of vibrations that transmit to water in my body. 
It’s a repository of primordial data from space; all creatures in water can access the Akasha. 
Tones entering my cells transform into feeling, an awareness of two worlds at once. 
I send back my thought, picture, feeling, and together we form new vibrations of knowledge that had been dormant in me. 
They’re here! 
I swim out of the cove toward them. 
So happy, I hum, and their answering chorus reverberates across water; we know each other. 
One dolphin is still, far below me. 
Her form takes shape, as she rises silently in bright blue, motionless, sunlit. 
Thank you for showing yourself, fulfilling a deep longing within my deep memory. 
2 
I empty my mind and listen for her reply, which comes as waves of emotion. 
A cloud surrounds me; I expand into its stillness and receive tones conveying information very fast. 
They teach me to hum, to whistle and sing; sound amplifies my body across open water; even their joyous play has this sensation of creating space, and when they sleep, stars augment their frequencies. 
We converse by mind-cell helixes of image and feeling. 
Cosmic legacy, cosmic extension imprint holographically on my heart neurons as dolphin empathy. 
There are sounds which can stop time, alter surroundings or shift your dimension. 
Swimming I lose my sense of place, even physicality, and connect with collective love. 
They teach me to join my aura to the cosmos by spiraling with me in sound-star tetrahedrons and to love those with whom we merge. 
Then being is healing, through innocence, when the animal becomes the teacher. 
3 
One dolphin swims toward me; I open telepathically and respond. 
I practice this method of reflection to contact life-forms in other space, who are trying however they can to meet us. 
Sirius radiates high frequencies to lighten the dark, denser planets. 
Dolphins travel to and from such a planet through diagrams like songs on ocean floors. 
They wish us to participate in over-lighting the collectivity of souls in our galaxy and ally with them to access the Space Sister-Brotherhood. 
Through these planetary vortices, dolphins catalyze starlight to refresh water on earth. 
Transference between species is both cellular and holographic or geometric. 
For example, my friend’s body is 3-D in front and 4-D in the back; she exists across dimensions, while appearing so ordinary in her yellow shirt and blue slacks, as we walk to the shore. 
“Memory is vibratory, like DNA, condensed light,” she volunteers. 
“You and I relate through our mutual past on Sirius, in Glastonbury, Santa Fe.” 
So I repeat their joyous, staccato syllables; I listen to “pod”casts of Noh singers and tune to high pitches the Pleiades use for propulsion into our atmosphere, using the star codes of dolphins. 
4 
We’ve attributes in realities we’re not aware of. 
Dolphins reside in these dimensions, like dreams in oceans. 
They swim within magnetic streams of other entities, angels we’ve invented, others’ heavens, cyclic destiny. 
I glimpse one jump from its energy band, attracted by my friend’s intense aura. 
He shows me earth’s sister planet replicated by sound as we co-create it by singing, sitting in her yard, gazing at the ocean under pine trees. 
There are messages in clouds, in wavelets on granite, cicada and meadowlark calls. 
Space travelers materialize morphogenetically from local beauty and merge with us. 
They enable travel between time and stars by projecting tones just ahead of the consciousness of the person migrating, the way dolphins pass me so fast, I don’t see the bubbles until they’re far, out of sight.

I need to get out of this situation, I said;
to be more like the day-fox
practically blowing smoke rings
out there on the pavement;
to be a nice little virus, or spore
on the wind with my hair tacky,
my swollen hand resting on the edge
of a smear on a napkin; to hardly touch
things, or access an inbox or die on
contact with a purchase order or
fellow demon of the backwash. Hell.
I don’t know what Jesus had in mind
when he said let the day’s own trouble
be sufficient for the day

Tell it this way: depression is the 30cm nail driving into the walls. 
If  you ever read about Plath, ever kept a lantern from dying, 
ever tended a garden it grew so wild to swallow god, ever kept 
dressing the fire in your bones, then you must know about grief, 
possibly how to end it. Maami once stood in this garden. Now, 
I stand in her shadow like a sphinx in a crusade of an inferno. 
In Lagos, another news says a student of microbiology, 400L, took 
a nook’s way to the sky, death could not stop for him—anymore. 
Let’s agree: failure is the arm swinging the pendulum across the face 
of every dream. These gardens grow wild & the birds unfurl their 
wings into an offering of flight. My cousin knelt in this garden once. 
I kowtow into his absence, my knees—eyes dressed in dust & dearth. 
In my mouth, every name glistens with a beak. I owe every wall 
a shadow, every bed a midnight of creaks & crimson, every heart 
an arrhythmia twice the speed of a destrier. In the library, my finger  Canterburies through The Selected Poems of Sylvia Plath, for once in 
my whole life, I recite “Lady Lazarus” & remember I have a father 
growing in the garden. Do I terrify?—what fear sweeps this little life? 
Tainted black & bruised, a chorus lifts itself onto my mouth’s blade:  dy—dying is an art, so just like everything else I do it exceptionally well, yelz 
yet even with honey disguised in holocaust, who, tell me, wants to die this young?

My daughter Louise asks about shame
and I want to tell her about the seer,
Marie Taréis, who worked with colors
and mirrors. The way she took my egg
drawing, yellow in the middle, then orange
then indigo, moved a pyramid of two mirrors
over and around it searching for my soul. 
But it was just an egg.
Other people’s drawings had symbols
multiplied and reflected—
the tree of life, Egyptian dancers,
a caduceus, gods and goddesses.
I cringed, kneeling at her feet
in a sweat of old shames. 
The time Ellen spotted nits in my hair,
that old perv dribbling over my fat thighs,
thread worms, the squirm and itch. Age ten,
sneaking in to read Playboy magazines
under my father’s bed. Disgust whitening
his face when he caught me looking
and reading about the ways I would be seen. 
Like that young priest colliding
with my dancer’s body all sweaty
and vital running up the stairs of the priory,
the pleasure in his smile quickly
changed to a pursed-up sneer, rejection,
blame, his shame smeared all over me.
Depression then, clinging to the bed, 
even the purple green pink I saw haloed
around a rose, too witchy and weird
like the wildflower remedies
I used in my practice. Circles
of  women, their whispered secrets
and me a kind of sin-eater grubbing
in the muck. She moved the mirrors 
searching for my soul in that childish drawing,
and I wished that I could do it all again.
I’d been so naïve when I made it,
playful like a child who’s forgotten
she isn’t loved. Somebody laughed.
The mirrors moved, opened,
kaleidoscoped the egg into a circle of candles.

You want a door you can be
            on both sides of at once. 
                       You want to be
           on both sides of here 
and there, now and then,
            together and—(what 
                       did we call the life
            we would wish back? 
The old life? The before?)
            alone. But any open 
                       space may be
            a threshold, an arch 
of entering and leaving.
            Crossing a field, wading 
                       through nothing
            but timothy grass, 
imagine yourself passing from
            and into. Passing through 
                       doorway after
            doorway after doorway.

I go inside the wolf
9:35 Sunday morning
Inside my beastly stinking
I kneel and light
A candle for snow
On the website
Churchoftheend.org 
Late Monday stuck in traffic
I stick also to the wolf
Like Teaberry gum
Glommed to the sole of a boot
Marked down in the Goodwill
Or ice clinging to a leaf
Three million years ago 
Though I am not famished
Nor does my fur bristle
Tuesday I go inside the wolf
Following standard sheep
Of no particular breed
Maybe old testament sheep
Maybe apocalyptic statistics 
How large my teeth and ears
How wild my panting Wednesday
When I put on the head
And stare out of the wolf
The Krewe of  Oak jerks
And turns the corner
From Oak onto Carrollton 
Hello fossils Hello Thursday
That smells like money
Hello American elm Hello dodo
Hello polar bear snoozing in a sauna
I hear inside the wolf
The Carborundum of coal drills
Resonating from glaciers 
On Friday I write Wolf Hell
On the bank I write it in wolf blood
To make (myself) believe
The condition is critical
I donate my body to science
To synch with the wolf
And spare the cost of the funeral 
Saturday crossing the causeway
Seeing three boys on skis
And sometimes in the sky
The letters of an ad or proposal
I am happy to be a rich animal driving
There is a great storm coming
I go inside the wolf

Grief without song could be any stone chapel built of loss
packed with aging villagers lulled reticent as rue
by a rote bell’s tongue, hemmed by iron gates and a yew
tree lurking mirthlessly beside a burial ground where moss- 
patinaed spirits and earth angels gather round relic icons
of threadbare hand-me-down faith. You sit/kneel/stand on
your misericord like an eaten Job in the organ belly’s drone,
sorting your parents’ hoarded aggregate—clothes pawn 
and charity shops won’t take, sewing kits, boxes of old
Polaroids of anonymous sepia-people you wouldn’t be here
without, file drawers of past taxes, uniforms from the war,
wedding dress, unworn shoes unfit for a holy soul ... 
—and that’s just the tip, to say nil of unspeakable sins
in attic and basement. Macular shorebirds scan whitecaps
for questions the mind’s eye can alight: dim synapse
of a candlelit nave, musty kneelers, a deacon’s 
chair from Suriname. Grief without song is wasted pain.
According to patron James, faith in works—in real acts
of creation—amplifies our part in salvation’s soundtrack
louder than wafers, wine or words of mumbled expiation 
dissolved on penitent tongues. In your rusted anechoic
husk, your veins blood-thrum a rushing river-hymn,
an electric fence of nerves ticking in your cerebellum—
until silence clears its throat ... and from her first chthonic 
tremolo it comes as no shock: how from Galway to Summerhill
churches are being repurposed as concert halls by clergy who swear
love’s lost call note still lingers, runic under the moored murmur
of all those services you sat unmoved through, the supernal 
flatulence of organ bellows at last revised in fidelity rare
as a black velvet angel with spindly legs and mental hair,
her aqueous blues beguiling as the B-side of prayer
beside an ocean we couldn’t hear but always knew was there.


^^EOP^^


A decade on, you make a fuss at finding me—an expression a slide
rule couldn’t read. I am thawing;                  spilling every              which way. Flip, you say, gripping my forearm with new faith.
             You usedn’t touch things. Not me.
                                                     Not a sister.
                                                     Not a rudder. The Magic Show would be freed from its cellophane skin
              by your will alone. I tried to hurry the process once
               —you remember—
               we weren’t really children                       you warned:                           Get behind the fourth wall and stay there.
Now, I see your hands. One too many diamonds
devalues all of the diamonds.
I could set a table on your life. No wine
would topple and stain.
Yes         the weight of a body can help 1 feel
lifted      but—too—it can turn 1
              into a bird-like thing hither-
              thithering the self away
              space all arsoned and malicious
              and youth then is given over.
              By not seeing 1 self in the glass ...
Looking in the right places for wrong things—
                                       in the same calm repetitious uncitylike places
                                       for things unownable. Legroom
                                       to cram with appendages. The leaves
along your drive are oil-slick. A car service is overdue.
Garden dewdense with crabgrass kinked bittercress poor man’s mustard swallowwort unctuous dandelions

I am heartened by all that neglect.
You correct me:              We are not truly invested in the lawn.
I don’t tell you            lest I am interrupted by a child I’ve never met
                                  lest they look familiar and need carrying to the toilet

                                      Books can be reduced to weatherproof icons on a screen,
                                      photographs to thumbprints, a child to a turkey baster, a principle
                                      to a charity donation.
This new country           this land of We

                                       My stressed husband left the tap gushing all day,
                                        the dote. We were at work, the kids were at crèche.    It was just
                                          too much. We came home to a swimming pool—      another private ocean
                                                                                                                          to love him across.
You place in my arms a damp crimped Yellow Pages
weighing of an infant        for a mooring. There are all sorts of numbers to sum.
None of you touches me—          not your belly, not your gaze, hot water bottle breast.
You go to the kitchen. To the sound of crying.

Fladry: a line of rope mounted along the top of a fence, from
which are suspended strips of fabric or colored flags that will flap
in a breeze, intended to deter wolves from crossing the fence-line.
USDA National Wildlife Research Center



I am weak and edible. Some human quality
stays weird, alien to the wild, outsiders,
bad sport with spooky habits not just fladry—
other enchantments against order, house paint,
yard art, border fences and the tunnels under borders,
the amen, the wedding ring, the flavored condom.
The wolves are back. I've seen them, seen the fladry
ranchers tie, red flags' flutter to puzzle or annoy,
folk-work tendered back from wood-shadow,
more each year, abjured with clover.
What I like most about the first shot of bourbon
is how it feels like letting go of a grudge. 
In the dream, I kill my friend and bury him
lime in the church basement between sump pump
and broken fireplace. On my knees I tile
red stone back to mosaic. Soldiers beat me up
and called me names in my own language,
this one, the one Whitman used to soothe
the dying, limbless, the bleeding, the infected. 
Beat me with fists slight more stone
than the shape that holds this pencil.
A house is held together by shapes. 
And yet in the ongoing negotiations between 
the world where I hold my son and 
famine, bombings, hate, prosperity—
two notes, octaves apart
attenuate what's hidden inside your body
to the invisible. It might help remembering
shadows and not hours. Infinity 
also has the contour of a children's game. 
Infants remember fladry, safe in the car seat grasping,
grasping. Some forces are enormous and move
against you, and when you pretend they aren't 
there, surge. Some swing on a hinge
which at night sounds like don't look back, 
don't look back

^^EOP^^


Even though we've already been dead,
when I find two trays of Grateful Dead tapes
in a Missoula secondhand store,
I too feel bound in the stasis of cassette,
plastic cases scarred and cracked
like old scuba goggles. Some retain
the delicate peg that lets the door swing open;
some have broken, maybe from a fall
when someone slid too fast the van door open
in a hot parking lot. Could be no tragedy
made the tapes secondhand greater
than a lost interest. Used to listen to them,
the owner might say, the way you adjust
to walking past a grave. I love him, or her, 
who has curated these happenings, although
the Dead's not really my bag. I follow
other melodies and injured visions, draw 
my cider from another press, a cooler lava.
I saw them once, summer of '95 at RFK,
with my friend Jax. It was terrible,
a lot of twentieth-century business came due
at once. Bob Dylan opened unintelligible
and sleepy as if reaching from the frost
to make known "in life I was Bob Dylan."
The Dead would play five more stands:
Auburn Hills, Pittsburgh, Noblesville,
Maryland Heights, Chicago, then done,
those last shows, autobiographies of indulgence.
Lightning struck by a branch. We left early.
Tapers caught every note of the show.
You can hear it forever at archive.org. 
In my greatest period of disorientation,
the Dead, like death, seemed best avoided. 
Yet I was the sort who might admit
a simplifying affection like the Dead.
I remember, coming down in a cornfield
near a creek at dawn, talking it out with Jason
whether those trees were weird, or that
weirdness took the form of trees, 
and every woman I pursued 
had a pet cat that made me sneeze.
They either liked the Dead or Neil
Diamond. Yet I would persevere,
like one with a disorder, hanging
in the doorway to their petite kitchens
while they ground coffee, or searched
the crisper for a roommate's hidden beer.
I longed to become more elaborate,
my approaches too simple and still are,
ask anyone about pleasure's light opera
and the children's music of the first kiss,
the hair metal of the second. And now
I play the Dead around the house. 
It's children's music. We play operettas, Pinafore, Penzance, for the same reasons,
because they are kind and almost meaningless.
I make few claims. What lasts is awkward
chance, like this thrift-store wrench
anthologized on pegboard, or smudges
on a yellow phone. I'm not buying 
the tapes today. The price isn't marked
and the clerk's busy. I keep what marriage
and child need, a few books and held-back objects,
metal or paper, letters from old loves,
because letters are antique, and for
the limestone antiquity of those affections.

Nothing worth noting
except an Andromeda
with quadrangular shoots—
            the boots

of the leaves

When my mother sent me for cigarettes
I'd buy a candy bar too, sign her name
to the book, and walk out with the green-
and-white carton, Virginia Slims 100s,
under my arm, the chocolate already gone.
Sugar, my god! like newspaper cartoon 
panels spread out on the kitchen table
where I'd pretend to smoke, imitating her.
After the corner store closed we made our groceries
at Dillon's, joined the impersonal. A villain
snatched her purse there when I was away at college
and on the phone she told me, excitedly,
how Topeka police chased the culprit, and she named
each street, each intersection and landmark,
the whole adventure, just for her. 
I'm grateful now to the sedentary house
though I've grown as large on candy as John Candy. 
My older brothers left home and our meals stayed
the same, a skillet high with beef Stroganoff,
pot roast in broth, chili con carne,
cheese sandwiches with mayo, flocks of fried chicken. 
Then the whole house went on a diet of cold
tofu cubes, a broken disk of lemon in a water glass,
cottage cheese measured onto lettuce,
and then back to London broil the next night,
no questions asked—lovely. We were emotions
without form, and I carry it with me, 
not just in frame, arm and jowl and belly,
but here in the intergalactic space of written
thought, the infinite stage where we come
talk to each other. Sugar makes me curious.
After Katrina, I took the diet where you eat meat,
and lost almost a hundred pounds from a surfeit
of bacon, sautéed pork medallions, beef & lamb.
The weight fell away like a knight's armor
after a joust. I bought shirts at a regular store.
I played softball and ran bases, bounded them,
as if on a new, more forgiving planet. And
I went crazy, evened out, broke down again,
inconsolable at the finale of Six Feet Under,
tears for my mother, postponed, and more
torrented for delay. Opening the book of grief
requires you read all the way to the end,
every time. Driving to work, I stopped
bewildered at a gas station, paid cash for two
Snickers providing more salvation
than I have ever known from religion's acres.
I write about the West and the South and home,
their tenderness and trouble and the weird spirits
breaking the best days. Still I find myself down
by the river at twilight. On the bridge deliberate-
seeming people walk by like victorious aliens,
past the consequential palaces lit as before,
the faces turning in their rotisseries. 
In profile, my mother looked like Alex Chilton,
lead singer of the Box Tops, and then Big Star. 
I used to see Chilton around New Orleans, 
in line at the grocery store, walking down Esplanade.
My mother also had a solo career, playing
solitaire and watching her own TV in the kitchen
and dying before everyone else. Dying, Chilton
urged his wife to run the red lights, his last words,
and when I had to leave my mother in the hospital
that was hard, and then again at the funeral
I set a marble under her folded hands, 
don't know why. It's been ten years.
Ten fingers, the closed eye of each knuckle,
each nail its years' fullest day moon.
Which shed the other? My scar from opening
a window, such force to move the wood frame,
so little to shatter glass it held. To be held so
again. Ten years, so forty seasons, eight endings
and beginnings, well, always a gust in them
which is the sigh of how she would note leaf and bird.
One hand to hold the coffee cup, one the cigarette. 
The red ember she became at midnight. Red light. Eye.

Ethics are learned from who you sleep with
the first few times, and theater is sex,
almost. Being in it, I mean, and being young,
with a lot of group undressing
and silence in darkness, chaste
permissions of the cast party,
spiked punch in the recreation room. 
I was always cast as Old Man
with tennis-shoe polish for white hair
and lines drawn where my lines now are,
forehead haiku, the eyes' briffits,
and parentheses around the muzzle.
I guess I miss it, achievement's sense,
the way a show's run ends
and everyone knows it together, 
a social pain, like the death
of a popular imaginary friend. 
When lights between scenes dim,
I like to see actors take props offstage
or team up with stagehands to move 
the built elements of our fantasy.
I hope they keep going, and sneak
some of the properties home to mix in
with their private dramas. I pass theaters
the way I pass churches, but like 
better this foldable theater
half-constructed in the mind,
sometimes thrown away
along with the day's receipts. 
Nothing's lost. I carry my own
props in—red telephone,
bowl of apples—and then with me draw
back into the unseen.

Part of the simulation is not knowing
your coyote's real name. Part of the simulation
is knowing your group could leave you
behind. Part of the simulation is knowing
that if you are left behind, a pickup truck
will take you back to your hotel.

Through caves, through brush, through needles
we form a line by holding on

The desert here is no desert at all & I think of how
I could cut a thick barrel cactus open
& eat it. In Chihuahua I've never seen
thick barrel cactus, only the thin long threads
of ocotillo that don't carry much water.   
    4
The chairos pay 250 pesos to walk 
all night in the desert in the middle of México
to simulate a border crossing. They bring jugs
filled with water & pose for selfies.

When you wade across the river you only have to worry
about swimming if a current pulls you under, not the red
glare of night-vision goggles, floodlights & guns.

In the simulation, only two people make it 
to the other side without getting stopped by actors
portraying la migra or narcos. All are brought back
for cups of atole. It's three in the morning, a girl laughs.

I walk back to my room, turn on the light
& the flying ants won't stop swarming. It is so dark
& have so much water left in my jug.
My teeth full of grit from the atole.

I run around the block eating an orange & drop
its rind in continents on concrete. This is my gift 
to the suburb, which told me not to burn logs 
when the air quality is marked yellow. My dog
chases me around the block barking & a woman
yells from her portrait window she could sue me 
for not using a leash. My phone reminds me to take
a shower, so I do. It's not that I'm dirty, it's that
I'd rather stay in bed wearing fur, watching 
documentaries about Dior. I apologize to no one
while scrubbing my scalp until it bleeds. I know
what it is to stare at yourself in a shattered mirror 
& not remember if it was you who broke it.
I wanted to see if I could mine my body for rubies
& look, I can! I write a letter & don't send it:  Here is a book & a ruby. One from my body,
the other I made after a fit with a pen. Both
worth nothing, but I like the thought of a man
picking them up & holding them in his hands

You are so poor that all you have is a country. 
Whenever you open your mouth
you talk about the country
to which you can no longer return.
China is a giant shield that you use 
to conceal your cowardice and to preempt
the onslaught of duties and hardships.  
You dare not take these as your rights:
the warm sunlight, clean water, fresh air,
a happy mood for an ordinary day.
As long as you live, you want to grieve
for the fairy tale of patriotism. 
You dare not take a country as a watchdog—
a good dog wags its tail to please its master,
becomes fierce in deterring burglars;
a bad dog ignores invaders
and only bites and barks at its master. 
You dare not clasp the dog's ear,
telling it, "You won't have food 
if you continue to misbehave like this." 
Actually, you are merely a grain of rice
that fell through China's teeth,
but you treat it as your god,
your universe, and the source 
of your suffering and happiness.

You must hold your quiet center,
where you do what only you can do.
If others call you a maniac or a fool,
just let them wag their tongues. 
If some praise your perseverance, 
don't feel too happy about it—
only solitude is a lasting friend. 
You must hold your distant center.
Don't move even if earth and heaven quake. 
If others think you are insignificant,
that's because you haven't held on long enough.
As long as you stay put year after year,
eventually you will find a world
beginning to revolve around you.

How, Alan Turing thought, does the soft-walled,
jellied, symmetrical cell
become the asymmetrical horse? It was just before dusk,
the sun's last shafts doubling the fence posts, 
all the dark mares on their dark shadows. It was just
after Schrödinger's What is Life?
not long before Watson, Franklin, Crick, not long before
supper. How does a chemical soup,
he asked, give rise to a biological pattern? And how
does a pattern shift, an outer ear
gradually slough its fur, or a shorebird's stubby beak
sharpen toward the trout?
He was halfway between the war's last enigmas
and the cyanide apple—two bites—
that would kill him. Halfway along the taut wires
that hummed between crime
and pardon, indecency and privacy. How do solutions, 
chemical, personal, stable, unstable, 
harden into shapes? And how do shapes break?
What slips a microfissure 
across a lightless cell, until time and matter
double their easy bickering? God?
Chance? A chemical shudder? He was happy and not,
tired and not, humming a bit 
with the fence wires. How does a germ split into a self?
And what is a—We are not our acts
and remembrances, 

^^EOP^^


So let misunderstanding spread.
It only shows how different 
you are from others.
Many things cannot bear
explaining; you'd better
let silence and labor speak 
in your defense. 
You don't need many friends
or to be enamored with beautiful women
or share the wine of happy gatherings,
because you have solitude enough,
content to leave this world without a sound. 
Distant thunder can give you pure joy.
Birds in the sky can teach you
another kind of wisdom.
As your soul is growing new wings
such words will disappear from your dictionary: boundary, complaint, cowardice, collapse...

I saw how they lived with restrictions.
Hardly past thirty they began to decline.
Like fish trapped in an invisible net,
they swam in all directions
but couldn't get anywhere.  
They had to surrender to the country
and it let it consume them at will.
They were like trees dependent 
on the strength of the forest, but none
could stand tall and straight alone.  
Their dreams were banished into caves
and withered away, never able to sprout.
While alive, they tried hard
to garner praise from everyone
so as to become model ghosts afterward.

     But in Indo-China I drained a magic potion, a loving-cup which I have shared since with
     many retired colon and officers of the Foreign Legion whose eyes light up at the mention
      of Saigon and Hanoi.
                     Graham Greene, Ways of Escape



1. Saigon 
    The other night, I went with friends to see the Saigon River where it loops past the venerable Majestic Hotel still standing on the riverbank at the end of the modernized, old downtown. From the hotel's top floor balcony we looked across to the Nhà Bè side from where, back in the American days, rockets were sometimes launched at the city from the mangrove swamps across the way. We stood awhile saying nothing just watching the boats chugging slowly behind dim bow lights as a full moon floated above the river.  
    During the war, the street behind the Majestic was—architecturally speaking—still a colonial avenue of small shops, GI bars, cafés, Maxim's nightclub (still there), and green-shuttered appartements with yellow, stuccoed walls leaking blotches of mildew. Now it's a dazzle of luxury hotels and skyscrapers. Downtown Saigon is nearly unrecognizable but, every now and then, my taxi would turn a corner, stirring up a distant encounter... an argument in a government ministry, a flower market where I once bought a pair of finches, or simply our corner cigarette stall where a gold-toothed old lady sold Marlboros tapped up with marijuana.  
    Behind the Majestic, the old Graham Greene apartment is gone, though one remembers the man who prepared Greene's opium, still climbing the creaky wooden steps into the early '70s to serve Americans with his valise of popes. Now, after many re-inventions, it's become a garish complex of glass and metal called "Katina" as the global imperium changed hands over the decades and the Rue Catinat became Tụ' Do or Freedom Street, and then, after our war, Đồng Khởi, or Great Uprising, and Saigon became Ho Chi Minh City.   
2. The Opium Pillow                  That night I woke from one of those short deep opium sleeps, ten minutes
                 long, that seem a whole night's rest...

    1 
A green turtle in broth is brought to the table—
I stare at an irregular formation of rocks 
above a pond and spot, on the water's
surface, a moon. As I step back and forth, 
the moon slides from partial to full
to partial and then into emptiness; but no 
moon's in the sky, just slanting sunlight, 
leafing willows along Slender West Lake,  
parked cars outside an apartment complex
where, against a background of chirping birds 
and car horns, two women bicker. Now
it's midnight at noon; I hear an electric saw 
and the occasional sound of lumber striking
pavement. At the bottom of a teacup, 
leaves form the character individual
and, after a sip, the number eight.  
Snipped into pieces, a green turtle is returned
to the table; while everyone eats, 
strands of thrown silk tighten, tighten
in my gut. I blink, and a woodblock carver 
peels off pear shavings, stroke by stroke,
and foregrounds characters against empty space.   
    2 
Begging in a subway, a blind teen and his mother stagger through the swaying car— 
a woman lights a bundle of incense and bows at a cauldron— 
people raise their palms around the Nine-Dragon Juniper— 
who knows the mind of a watermelon vendor picking his teeth?— 
you glance up through layers of walnut leaves in a courtyard— 
biting into marinated lotus stems— 
in a drum tower, hours were measured
as water rising then spilling from one kettle into another— 
pomegranate trees flowering along a highway— 
climbing to the top of a pagoda, you look down at rebuilt city walls— 
a peacock cries— 
always the clatter of mah-jongg tiles behind a door— 
at a tower loom, a man and woman weave brocade silk— 
squashing a cigarette above a urinal, a bus driver hurries back— 
a musician strikes sticks, faster and faster— 
cars honk along a street approaching a traffic circle— 
when he lowers his fan, the actor's face has changed from black to white— 
a child squats and shits in a palace courtyard— 
yellow construction cranes pivot over the tops of high-rise apartments— 
a woman throws a shuttle with green silk through the shed— 
where are we headed, you wonder, as you pick a lychee and start to peel it—  
    3 
Lightning ignites a fire in the wilderness: in hours,
200 then 2,000 acres are aflame; when a hotshot
crew hikes in to clear lines, a windstorm
kicks up and veers the blaze back, traps them,
and their fire shelters become their body bags. 
Piñons in the hills have red and yellow needles—
in a bamboo park, a woman dribbles liquefied sugar
onto a plate, and it cools, on a stick, in the form
of a butterfly; a man in red pants stills
then moves through the Crane position.
A droplet hangs at the tip of a fern—water
spills into another kettle; you visualize
how flames engulfed them at 50 miles per hour.
In the West, wildfires scar each summer—
water beads on beer cans at a lunch counter—
you do not want to see exploding propane tanks;
you try to root in the world, but events sizzle
along razor wire, along a snapping end of a power line.   
    4 
Two fans graze on leaves in a yard—
as we go up the Pearl Tower, I gaze
through smog at freighters along the river.
A thunderstorm gathers: it rains and hails
on two hikers in the Barrancas; the arroyo
becomes a torrent, and they crouch for an hour. 
After a pelting storm, you spark into flame
and draw the wax of the world into light—
ostrich and emu eggs in a basket by the door, 
the aroma of cumin and pepper in the air. 
In my mouth, a blister forms then disappears.
At a teak table, with family and friends,
we eat Dungeness crab, but, as I break
apart shell and claws, I hear a wounded elk
shot in the bosque. Canoers ask and receive
permission to land; they beach a canoe
with a yellow cedar wreath on the bow
then catch a bus to the fairgrounds powwow.   
    5 
—Sunrise: I fill my rubber bucket with water
      and come to this patch of blue-gray sidewalk—
I've made a sponge-tipped brush at the end
      of a waist-high plastic stick; and, as I dip it,
I know water is my ink, memory my blood— 
the tips of purple bamboo arch over the park—
      I see a pitched battle at the entrance to a palace
and rooftops issuing smoke and flames—
      today, there's a white statue of a human figure,
buses and cars drive across the blank square— 
at that time, I researched carp in captivity 
      and how they might reproduce and feed
people in communes—I might have made 
      a breakthrough, but Red Guards knocked at the door—
they beat me, woke me up at all hours 
until I didn't know whether it was midnight or noon—
      I saw slaughtered pigs piled on wooden racks,
snow in the spring sunshine—the confessions
      they handed me I signed—I just wanted it
to end—then herded pigs on a farm—wait— 
a masseur is striking someone's back,
      his hands clatter like wooden blocks—
now I block the past by writing the present—
      as I write the strokes of moon, I let the brush swerve rest for a moment before I lift it 
and make the one stroke hook—ah, it's all
      in that hook—there, I levitate: no mistakes
will last, even regret is lovely—my hand
      trembles; but if I find the gaps resting places,
I cut the sinews of an ox, even as the sun 
moon waxes—the bones drop, my brush is sharp,
      sharper than steel—and though people murmur
at the evaporating characters, I smile, frown
      fidget, let go—I draw the white, not the black—  
    6 
Tea leaves in the cup spell above then below—
outside the kitchen window, a spray  
of wisteria blossoms in May sunshine.
What unfolds inside us? We sit at a tabletop 
that was once a wheel in Thailand: an iron hoop
runs along the rim. On a fireplace mantel, 
a flame flickers at the bottom of a metal cup.
As spokes to a hub, a chef cleans blowfish: 
turtles beach on white sand: a monk rakes
gravel into scalloped waves in a garden: 
moans issue from an alley where men stir
from last night's binge. If all time converges 
as light from stars, all situations reside here. 
In red-edged heat, I irrigate the peach trees; 
you bake a zucchini frittata; water buffalo
browse in a field; hail has shredded lettuces, 
and, as a farmer paces and surveys damage, 
a coyote slips across a road, under barbed wire.   
    7 
The letter A was once an inverted cow's head,
but now, as I write, it resembles feet
planted on the earth rising to a point.  Once is glimpsing the Perseid meteor shower—
and, as emotion curves space, I find
a constellation that arcs beyond the visible. 
A neighbor brings cucumbers and basil;
when you open the bag and inhale, the world
inside is fire in a night courtyard 
at summer solstice; we have limned the time here
and will miss the bamboo arcing along
the fence behind our bedroom, peonies 
leaning to earth. A mayordomo retrenches
the opening to the ditch; water runs near
the top of juniper poles that line or length— 
in the bosque, the elk carcass decomposes
into a stench of antlers and bones. Soon
ducks will nest on the pond island, and as 
a retired violinist who fed skunks left a legacy—
one she least expected—we fold this 
in our pocket and carry it wherever we go.

And what is Life?—An hour-glass on the run,
A Mist retreating from the morning sun,
    A busy, bustling, still repeated dream;
Its length?—A minute's pause, a moment's thought;
    And happiness?—A bubble on the stream,
That in the act of seizing shrinks to nought. 
What are vain Hopes?—The puffing gale of morn,
    That of its charms divests the dewy lawn,
And robs each flow'ret of its gem,—and dies;
    A cobweb hiding disappointment's thorn,
Which stings more keenly through the thin disguise. 
And thou, O Trouble?—nothing can suppose,
(And sure the power of wisdom only knows,)
    What need requireth thee:
So free and liberal as thy bounty flows,
    Some necessary cause must surely be:
But disappointments, pains, and every woe
    Devoted wretches feel,
The universal plagues of life below,
    Are mysteries still 'neath Fate's unbroken seal. 
And what is Death? is still the cause unfound?
That dark, mysterious name of horrid sound?—
    A long and lingering sleep, the weary crave.
And Peace? where can its happiness abound?—
    No where at all, save heaven, and the grave. 
Then what is Life?—When stripp'd of its disguise,
    A thing to be desir'd it cannot be;
Since every thing that meets our foolish eyes
    Gives proof sufficient of its vanity.
'Tis but a trial all must undergo;
    To teach unthankful mortals how to prize
That happiness vain man's denied to know,
    Until he's call'd to claim it in the skies.

Madonna del Parto, ca. 1460, Piero della Francesca



Are the drapes drawn open or being closed?
Each of the heavy, velvet wings is clasped
in the hands of a little angel, a little man really,
in the shades of plum and mint green that frame 
the birthing tent's opening for a girl
who retreats into or emerges from the dark.
It isn't clear: the perspective is such
that if I cover the painting's 
top half with a hand, Mary steps forward;
if I cover the lower, she shrinks back,
her blue bodice split at the bulging seams
to show the pear-white cut of her linen shift,
the great weight of the child she is about to bear
and later bury. And even if I didn't believe
the child would rise again, I would believe the artist
had seen such fear paint a girl's face
when the eldest women in the village
were called for help, and fresh straw brought in
if there wasn't a bed, and hot water, and rose oil to rub
over the hips, and vinegar and sugar water
to drink, and hog's gut and a thick needle
to sew her up with later. Even if I did not believe
in Mary's joy, I would believe in her pain, the quick flick
of her thoughts turning to the sister, or the cousin, 
or to her own mother who'd died giving birth,
the baby, too, not making it, for the birth
was in winter: ice so clogged the village's 
deep ruts that the midwife's cart slipped
into the soak dike, splitting the wood wheel
in two, and by the time the woman could walk 
the steep hill up to the villa, the mother had torn,
and in the rush to save her, no one worked
quick enough to cut the cord wrapped
around the baby's throat. Or the baby came out
strong and fine, but died two years later
when it stumbled into a fire, or was bitten by a rat
and sickened and starved, or caught the fever 
that spread through the town when all the animals
were stabled inside the houses for winter. 
So many people died, so many people
were supposed to die, it's hard to conceive
of how the mothers survived their grief,
and how they named their next, living baby
after the dead one because the name, at least, 
was good. It's hard to know whether I should read
the deepest grief or resignation or both in the line 
from Mary Shelley's 1818 notebook, the year 
her daughter, Clara, died, two weeks
after Mary had given birth to her. Woke this morning.
Found my baby dead,

Small flames afloat in blue duskfall, beneath trees
anonymous and hooded, the solemn trees—by ones
and twos and threes we go down to the water's level edge
with our candles cupped and melted into little pie-tins
to set our newest loss free. Everyone is here. 
Everyone is wholly quiet in the river's hush and appropriate dark.
The tenuous fires slip from our palms and seem to settle
in the stilling water, but then float, ever so slowly,
in a loose string like a necklace's pearls spilled,
down the river barely as wide as a dusty road. 
No one is singing, and no one leaves—we stand back
beneath the grieving trees on both banks, bowed but watching,
as our tiny boats pass like a long history of moons
reflected, or like notes in an elder's hymn, or like us,
death after death, around the far, awakening bend.

So after M died, she turned
to the dog. His copper eyes, the sinewy
haunch muscles. The way he perched
by the door of M's study as if
sensing the body he missed
behind it. Something she would not
let herself feel, dry-eyed
at the funeral, refusing to gather
up the pants that still hung in his closet
beneath which the dog slept, breathing in
M's last particles until,
out of some extravagant kindness
or pity, she gave the dog
one of his sweaters. She watched
as the dog circled and pawed at it, tearing
at the tissuey material in his attempts
to fall asleep. Impossible
not to love such need

^^EOP^^





after Susan Stewart



No one ever died for a bite
of one, or came back from the dead
for a single taste: the cool flesh
cellular or stony, white 
as the belly of the winter hare
or a doe's scut, flicking,
before she mates. Even an unripe one 
is delicious, its crisp bite cleaner
almost than water and its many names
just as inviting: Bartlett and Comice,  
Anjou, Nashi, Concorde
and Seckel, the pomegranate-skinned
Starkrimson, even the medieval  
Bosc, which looks like it dropped
from an oil painting. It is not a sin
to eat one, though you may think 
of a woman's body as you do it,
the bell-shaped swell of it
rich in your hand, and for this reason 
it was sacred to Venus, Juno, all women
celebrated or dismissed 
in its shape, that mealy sweetness
tunneling from its center, a gold  
that sinks back into itself with age. 
To ripen a pear, wrap it in paper, 
lay it in cloth by an open window 
or slip a rotten one beside it
on a metal dish: dying cells call always
to the fresh ones, the body's  
siren song that, having heard 
it once, we can't stop singing.
This is not the fruit 
that will send you to hell
nor keep you there;
it will not give you knowledge, 
childbirth, power, or love;
you won't know more pain
for having eaten one, or choke
on a bite to fall asleep 
under glass. It has no use
for archer or hero, though
anything you desire from an apple 
you can do with the pear, like a dark sister
with whom you might live out
your secret desires. Cook it 
in wine, mull it with spices, roast it
with honey and cloves. Time sweetens
and we taste it, so gather the fruit 
weeks before ripeness,
let summer and winter both
simmer inside, for it is  
a fall fruit whose name in China
means separation, though only the fearful
won't eat one with those they love. 
To grow a tree from seed,
you'll need a garden
and a grafting quince, bees, a ladder,  
shears, a jug; you'll need water
and patience, sun and mud,
a reverence for the elders 
who told no true stories
of this fruit's origin,
wanting to give us the freedom
of one thing that's pleasure alone.  
Cool and sweet, cellular and stony,
this is the fruit I'll never die for, 
nor come back from the dead 
for a single taste. 
The juice of the pear
shines on my cheeks. 
There's no curse in it. I'll eat
what I like and throw the rest
to the grasses. The seeds 
will find whatever soils they were meant for.

From the porch at dusk I watched
a kingfisher wild in flight
he could only have made for joy. 
He came down the river, splashing
against the water’s dimming face
like a skipped rock, passing 
on down out of sight. And still
I could hear the splashes
farther and farther away 
as it grew darker. He came back
the same way, dusky as his shadow,
sudden beyond the willows. 
The splashes went on out of hearing.
It was dark then. Somewhere
the night had accommodated him 
—at the place he was headed for
or where, led by his delight,
he came.

At first we all
went down to the lake
to hold hands,
all the multicolored 
signs said
with love
we will resist,
over my head
I lifted my son
so he could see
what people
look like
when they hear
the song Imagine,
a few weeks later
again people stood
at the water,
this time at night
holding flashlights
to say to fire
you came 
without permission
and took our young
gentle soldiers
for art
so we will show
even with our old
technology
we can see
each other
without you,
others booed 
the mayor which was
my friend said understandable,
I don't know 
what is anymore,
everyone understands
in a different
contradictory way
the so far purely 
abstract
catastrophe
so many millions
of choices
brought us,
not too far
from the water
I sat on the couch
below the sound 
of blades
drinking amber
numbing fluid
my thoughts
chopping the air
feeling not
what is the word
to be a father equipped,
mine never told me
where to hide
a brick of gold,
for a long time
I have known
no voices 
will come at last
to tell us how
to stop pretending
we don't know 
if it is not 
safe for some
it is not
for anyone.

It was midday before we noticed it was morning.
The boy cousins brought us a tray—soup and cheese,
warm soda, and a soft cloth and candy for her fever.
They wouldn't come in, the tray weighing between them.
They stood like woodwork inside the door frame. 
By afternoon the old procession—silence at the lip
of a dozen night travelers tired and grieving, one
by one, or pairs floating to the bed and back
with a touching of hands like humming,
and the one we gathered for slipping farther 
for all the good we could do. She lay in her shadow.
She looked to no one. Her daylilies bobbed wide
open out in the wild, blue sun and the same bee
kept nosing her window to reach them.
Dusk: even the boys were back watching it try.

A rabbit has stopped on the gravel driveway: 
           imbibing the silence,
           you stare at spruce needles: 
                                          there's no sound of a leaf blower, 
                                          no sign of a black bear; 
a few weeks ago, a buck scraped his rack
           against an aspen trunk;
           a carpenter scribed a plank along a curved stone wall. 
                        You only spot the rabbit's ears and tail: 
when it moves, you locate it against speckled gravel,
but when it stops, it blends in again; 
           the world of being is like this gravel: 
                        you think you own a car, a house,
                        this blue-zigzagged shirt, but you just borrow these things.  
Yesterday, you constructed an aqueduct of dreams
                        and stood at Gibraltar,
                                                but you possess nothing. 
Snow melts into a pool of clear water;
     and, in this stillness, 
                        starlight behind daylight wherever you gaze. 


^^EOP^^


No matter what the grief, its weight,
we are obliged to carry it.
We rise and gather momentum, the dull strength
that pushes us through crowds.
And then the young boy gives me directions
so avidly. A woman holds the glass door open,
waiting patiently for my empty body to pass through.
All day it continues, each kindness
reaching toward another—a stranger
singing to no one as I pass on the path, trees
offering their blossoms, a child
who lifts his almond eyes and smiles.
Somehow they always find me, seem even
to be waiting, determined to keep me
from myself, from the thing that calls to me
as it must have once called to them—
this temptation to step off the edge
and fall weightless, away from the world.

I was born the autumn
after a wave of flowers
swept the land 
too late to appear in even
one poem by Frank O'Hara
so my poems do not delight me 
which until recently 
I didn't even realize
was an option 
I always just hoped
at best they could be
good-natured rebellious 
first sons who wander
intently curious but 
not too brilliant 
as if Wordsworth scrubbed
of self-regard got drunk
on a Greek island 
with L. Cohen and Marianne
then they all went to see
Emily putting on 
a black dress to go out 
and meet her dangerous love
under an arbor of stars 
crying blood and nameless
birds with black eyes
that attack everyone 
so she could not hang out
but gave them the other dress
I have always been afraid 
to wear and some drugs too
and they took them and went
to a library and cried 
then the intercom informs
the kids there is no threat
after all and rising up 
from behind their desks
they reach out
with strange smiles 
dear committee of the future
I could tell you I am almost 
sure you will find my poems 
unacceptable because
they appropriate the common
human experiences of fear 
and desire taking little
sips from the nest
dumping bits of blue 
into the river which until
my poems was more
than cerulean enough 
but the truth is
I want you and everyone 
to like them 
so I sit up here born
too early and late
staring at these trees 
their black leaves turning 
slowly dull green
in the morning light of tasks 
ashamed I actually open 
my mouth to ask
mundane diurnal silence 
to help me forget 
whatever I know
so I can write 
what I am sure
people will mostly
not read or tell me 
no matter how clearly 
I speak they sorrowfully 
don't understand 
then I switch on the hum
of my old device to listen
to the sons of no one 
sing and remember
yes because I belong 
to the first generation  
that named itself
my great ambition has
always been to be 
a loser with pointless integrity
that just serves the man
and with the fatal certainty 
of the most useless
letter in the alphabet I know
to say who cares we've got 
Kim Gordon and Deal
and these cigarettes
will just kill someone else 
and there's always a job
for people who sort of 
studied the quadrivium 
and at least when we are
kissing their asses 
we know it's wrong so 
lovingly not forgiving
ourselves for hating ourselves
is the only solution


^^EOP^^


I commit to vote because
I'm pretty sure I grab
whatever I need from the world
and place it in my mind
which is getting incrementally
like the commons
undeniably more toxic and sad
yes I too walk around
considering my intractable problems
complaining it's too late
for more sonatas
everything is already too beautiful
music and anger won't save us
yet I commit to talking
earnestly with Sarah
about the school board
it will be night and we will be sitting
shoulder to shoulder 
at the old table we love
each holding a pencil
like grade school children left alone at last
then in the morning
before our son wakes
I commit to holding
this tiny bit of quicksilver
(quick in the sense of living
in its very molecular nature
it wants to usefully combine with yours)
in my palm and to walking
up to the blue mailbox
I pass most mornings
in that familiar silence
under those nameless little trees
when all things that surround me wait


^^EOP^^


Like all strangers who temporarily
find themselves moving in the same direction
we look out the window
without really seeing or down at our phones
trying to catch the dying signal
then the famous lonesome whistle
so many singers have sung about
blows and our bodies shudder
soon we pick up speed
and pass the abandoned factories
there has lately been so much conversation about
through broken windows they stare 
asking us to decide
but we fall asleep next to each other
riding into the tunnel
sharing without knowing the same dream
in it we are carrying something
an empty casket somehow so heavy
only together can we carry it
over a bridge in the snow
emerging suddenly into the light
we wake and open our laptops
or a book about murder
or a glossy magazine
though we are mostly awake
part of us still goes on solving 
problems so great they cannot be named
even once we have reached our destination
and disembark into whatever weather
for a long time there is a compartment
within us filled with analog silence
inside us the dream goes on and on

Across the deep eternal sky
a thousand changing shapes flit by, 
i.e. clouds, or so I have always called them.
But how is it I have never 
among my incessant coffee refills
and insectivorous travels 
among the cubicles in search
of individual wrapped chocolates 
and conversations asked you
if you in my heart detect 
several as I do in yours
of the adorable qualities  
of broken folding chairs?
Or why we build desired outcomes 
on the spots where old ones stood?
I call this meeting to order: 
item one let's go to lunch and order
wild boar. Let's have an old-world chat 
about the original action items.
O fuck the fluting on the donuts! 
I feel totally Anglo Saxon!
I want for once in my life to whip 
around an actual halberd gleaming
in the sun and win 
a great victory versus the air!
Here is my project update: 
the file cabinet is watching
over the particles 
safely asleep in a beam,
and nothing into our building 
has at last so gently crashed
leaving us bored and fortunate. 
I move our faces
around this highly polished table 
to each other look
almost familiar 
so let us slip into the light
blue sleeve this afternoon 
so gracefully carries
the next few hours in 
and together forget
what our great task is.

I'm walking in sight of the Río Nambé— 
salt cedar rises through silt in an irrigation ditch— 
the snowpack in the Sangre de Cristos has already dwindled before spring— 
at least no fires erupt in the conifers above Los Alamos— 
the plutonium waste has been hauled to an underground site— 
a man who built plutonium triggers breeds horses now— 
no one could anticipate this distance from Monticello— 
Jefferson despised newspapers, but no one thing takes us out of ourselves— 
during the Cultural Revolution, a boy saw his mother shot by a firing squad— 
a woman detonates when a spam text triggers bombs strapped to her body— 
when I come to an upright circular steel lid, I step out of the ditch— 
I step out of the ditch but step deeper into myself— 
I arrive at a space that no longer needs autumn or spring— 
I find ginseng where there is no ginseng my talisman of desire— 
though you are visiting Paris, you are here at my fingertips— 
though I step back into the ditch, no whitening cloud dispels this world's mystery— 
the ditch ran before the year of the Louisiana Purchase— 
I'm walking on silt, glimpsing horses in the field— 
fielding the shapes of our bodies in white sand— 
though parallel lines touch in the infinite, the infinite is here—

Before the burglar
raped my grandmother 
he pushed her down
a flight of stairs.  
Ankle turned, hip unhitched.
There was no getting up, no 
hope for flight. She told me that while he
was on top of her, she stared up 
at the clock from the kitchen floor. 
Watched each minute crawl by 
like a half-smashed bug, 
imagining the school bus 
emptying her sons into the yard.
Thought of the sandwiches 
 
she had no time to make. 
As the man pulled his pants up, 
she noticed the tattoo on his
forearm. MOTHER framed 
by a heart. My sons will be home
soon,

^^EOP^^


When I was nineteen
I stole a gun. The drug dealer
next door, blitzed out
of her skull, didn't 
see me
pull it from her
kitchen cupboard. 
As the California sun
sank below the
foothills, I haunted
the neighborhood,
screaming your
doomed name. 
I was ready.
A death-wish Romeo
beneath your bedroom 
window. Split once
a neighbor threatened
to call the cops.  
I never told you this story. 
Not because I regret 
what I did, was prepared
to do—those forty-five
minutes of havoc, hunting
down your head.  
Back then, I wasn't shit. 
Just electrified violence.
All fists, piss & safety pins, 
an unwed teenage mother
with no address. 
You had parents. Freckles. 
A three-story house. I'd listen
to you spit your angsty
fiction while I slept in parks 
& ate from garbage cans.  
When I learned you were
coveting the man I loved,
I felt my insides darken,
cursed your well-fed
royalty disguised as grit. 
Got tired of the forgery,
wanted all the black-eyed 
wealth to myself:
BANG, you're dead.  
Wish I could say I've put
those days behind me,
that I never fall into
the steel-weight daydream
of a gun's hard lesson. 
1995—half my life ago—still,
every time you call
to bitch about your latest
ex-soulmate or DUI,
one more kid taken
from you by the state 
I want to tell you
about the only night
you survived.
When something
said fall asleep 
& you did. 
Crashed hard
with a starving bitch
& pistol at the ready,
birds still singing
in the half daylight. 
I'll say it here, right now, 
one more time, with feeling:
it was the only moment
in this wretched life
a god was on my side. 


^^EOP^^


I have learned to need the body
I spent years trying to rid the world of 
have learned to cherish its pale rebel hymn
warped by ghost heat, carried, carried 
by all my loyal dead. I have learned
to crawl backward into the wildnerness 
to ask, to eat, to steep in your gentleness. 
Let this be where I permit forgiveness 
to know your name, to leave our cruelest years
where & how we need them most— 
                                                       behind & unlit.

Reed, who’s got one strike left   before he gets
   life, tells me afterbirth is what the cougars are after.
“Lambing season,” he says, “plus, placenta’s a delicacy
         to a cat.” I try to explain how 
intent they were, how their intentions appeared
        to involve me, but Reed won’t hear
a word. My    mother takes me at my word & won’t
  let me leave the house. So I learn to regret
     my story, sit indoors       for weeks, watching 
for hunters, only to find what’s hunted: the gray
        diggers interring green
walnuts at the feet of the tree    they fell from. Now
all I can think of is blood, how we first feed
                                              on it without knowing 
we feed on it or that it possesses   a plan all its own. Every girl
                 I know has started, nicknamed it
Florence or Flo or the Red Badge   of Courage. It’ll be years
   for me. When a doctor finally says      I’ve fallen so far
                                 off the growth chart he’s worried 
I won’t find my way back,     I’m fourteen
                           & can still go out shirtless
without causing a stir. “Eat more butter,” he says, but I don’t
        yet believe      what I eat will help me hate 
        my body any less. Reed doesn’t hate
his kids. He loves them      too much is the story. People tell me
        to avoid him, but I don’t. His flock grazes
the fields I drag      my shadow over & I    have nothing
    better to do than gaze at the perpetual       feeding, mumbling
Exodus under my breath,    some passage      about bearing 
                            false witness. & somehow I think I know
       by now that knowing involves the senses turning a touch
licentious. My parents     haven’t known each other in years
        & no one wants    to know me either. A tree falls
                 in the woods. Consensus leaves    us cold, etc.  Green Eggs and Ham,       I really dislike that kid’s book, with all
    its I-would-nots & could-nots on boats & in woods,
all its reds & its greens inter-         mingled, muck of inks
      you should never swallow. A doctor hands me 
           a copy, says, “eat up” & pulls a polyester curtain
between us. I’m three & can’t yet read
                 any word on my own    but “God.” He reaches
his hand, gloved         green, inside my mother & says,
   “what about this weather we are
                                 having?” Just between us, 
I warn the story’s      star not to touch
                  its plate, but in the end it’ll do
   what the good Dr.’s scripted. I throw
                               the book. My mother stops singing
beneath a stream of steaming
                    water, a red-black mass dehiscing
at her feet. “Find    your father,” 
she commands, so I run
                      through yellow meadows, yelling
   his name, his name, which the hills give back
to me, though he can’t        hear them from the other side
                           of this state. On the other 
    side of this state, my mother
                          finds her first horse. It is 1980, decade
of the single-wide & no-children-in-the-
                          picture. Just a mare called Chianti
        who dies one year
before I’m born. Her heart, size of a child’s    globe, fails 
while foaling, something involving      a length of decayed
               intestine & great        pain. My parents take
great pains to save        her, but the foal will lose
                        her         the instant             the air 
enters his chest. In Egyptian hieroglyphs, “I” can be rendered
     as a single reed & “meadow” as a row of three
reeds bound by a flatline   of horizon. I know little,
                              even now, though enough
             to say my name & know it isn’t 
mine, but just       an inadvertent testament
      to my mother’s love of horses & “good
breeding.” In an ancient Seventeen
               Magazine

All my friends are finding new beliefs.
This one converts to Catholicism and this one to trees.
In a highly literary and hitherto religiously-indifferent Jew
God whomps on like a genetic generator.
Paleo, Keto, Zone, South Beach, Bourbon.
Exercise regimens so extreme she merges with machine.
One man marries a woman twenty years younger
and twice in one brunch uses the word verdant;
another’s brick-fisted belligerence gentles
into dementia, and one, after a decade of finical feints and teases
like a sandpiper at the edge of the sea,
decides to die.
Priesthoods and beasthoods, sombers and glees,
high-styled renunciations and avocations of dirt,
sobrieties, satieties, pilgrimages to the very bowels of  being ...
All my friends are finding new beliefs
and I am finding it harder and harder to keep track
of the new gods and the new loves,
and the old gods and the old loves,
and the days have daggers, and the mirrors motives,
and the planet’s turning faster and faster in the blackness,
and my nights, and my doubts, and my friends,
my beautiful, credible friends.

bird

I was making my way through the grounds of a stately home which had been turned into a public garden. I seemed to be being followed at a distance by a huge bird, like a heron, but pink, kind of coral-colored. I felt like it was  mimicking me. I hurried on to try to get away from it and saw a door into a small hut. I went inside thinking I would hide in there until the bird had gone away. The hut had windows at head height so I was able to look out and observe the bird’s progress. I saw it approach another girl, who was with a man, probably her boyfriend. They were crouching down to look into some kind of display case. The girl was dancing, unaware of the bird, which was now right next to her. It started moving in time with her body, but slowly, as if insulting her. Then it moved off in my direction. I ducked down below the window. There was a small bolt on the inside of the door but it looked weak. I worried that the bird would hear me locking it, so I held the door shut with my hand. When I heard breathing I knew the bird was right outside. The breathing got louder. The bird was taking its time to leave. I don’t know how it got in. Its claws were like the claws of a giant insect, pink and reaching. There was one inside me. Deep. I was screaming. It was a very beautiful bird.

therapy

There were only two men in the therapy workshop. One was a young man from another country, whose means and modes of self-expression troubled the rest of the group, but we could not be sure to what extent this sense of trouble was prejudicial and based on our poor understanding of cultural mores which in this young man’s country of origin were considered perfectly standard. He was always drawing up overflowing buckets from his deep wells of sadness and then dropping them back down again almost before anyone had got a glimpse of them. At least, that was our guess, because he generally maintained a deep, impermeable silence which had the queasy atmosphere of a lake that was so still as to appear to be a solid, or perhaps a gel, something  sealed with a film, a film which—one had the impression—had formed through the substance’s fear of contamination through exposure to air.

fish tank

I watched a woman in a fish tank shitting directly into a tortoise’s mouth. It was meant to be some kind of spectacle—she was invited to do it and was very happy to, and the tortoise was happy to eat.

The man across the table waiting
for my take is not unkind. In fact,
his hair stands up sweetly like a boy’s 
as he offers me some praise I must
deflect. A little jewel lobbed my way
and throwing beams from all its facets, 
the kudo rides the charge of light
between our sturdy roles. Of course, I want
to catch it, enjoy the way it cools 
the palm and will later weight
the paper on my desk, but even
as it lofts my open ego, I’m sure 
others are more worthy, or worse,
that if I take it I’ll be jinxed
and never see its like again. Maybe 
it’s just midwestern diffidence
that leaps to intercept the gem
and save it for the velvet drawer. 
All this action happens over plates
of greens with tangled stems,
seeds and spices that tease 
and sting the troubled tongue,
so when I down it all and open
for response, the blurt 
who lives somewhere deep
in what might be raw gut
or lizard brain, sneaks up, 
looks around with those
comic mobile eyes, and speaks,
oh God, that thing crouched 
inside. I know there are those
to whom this ordinary shame
never comes, but mine’s alive 
even in the kindest company.
It clicks its claws and likes to bare
ferocious little teeth, but it’s not, 
like a cat, immune to what you think.
Sometimes it hangs around all night
when the encounter’s long forgotten 
by the man across the table. The blurt
assigned to him a power and feeds
it in the dark with oily possibilities 
that agitate toward dream.
Even when the worst has already
passed, and I’m no one again— 
like a child, but without
a future’s magic wand,
the blurt knows how to hurt 
by simply sticking to its source.

Most things have hidden roots, why not piety, that crow’s wing.
I bought a card at the shop, mailed it to my brother.
He asked nothing of me. Did you imagine some greater riddle,
then. A spindle whorl. A spool. Dog rose in flower at the Tywi’s
edge. You may make an image if you like. The sheep do it.
Ants do it in and through their labors, their chemical mazes.
It is time, my friend said, to reckon our exhaustion, to tote it up.
That is, after all, what math is for, its foolproof schematic.
Dig deep into the eye, the saints advise. They remember time
but no longer understand it. I remember
the single crow drinking from the ancient well, that startled
as I drew near. This happened in time, its plague of roots
undermining every present motive. Here are some things
other people do inside buildings, give or take a thousand years—
is what I wrote my friend. The dedicated space
inside the chancel was very small. Whether to construct
a larger chancel was debated, and then rejected. Because,
it was argued, the dead lie sleeping there, in their natural forms.
It is easy to forgive measure: the wild garlic, the devastated
bluebells in the wood. My bruised ribs seek a shelter—
other than the body, I mean. Once, I talked in my sleep.
Now I watch workmen clear the failed plantation of everything
that resembles glass. I count, as every beast must, the flecks
of ash that fall upon my pelt. I was surprised, my teacher-
friend confessed, by how few children knew the name of that
old war. I am surprised by dog’s mercury, pink campion,
bird’s-nest fern at the path’s clean edge. You can draw a town
on any map. Imagine the people who live there, what they stow
in their gardens, their medical anomalies, their sports teams.
Just the same we are never very far from an altar, here.
One can be very precise about worship, about the intensity
of the sun and other light that travels further to rest
within our cells, to mimic rest. The family arguing in Welsh
is not part of the permanent display, the docent clarified.
Remember the children’s inflatable birthday pavilion
stripped of its gaudy hexachords. Perceptible matter goes a long
way toward explaining the universe, but never far enough.
That is why mammals engage in breath, ceramics, politics.
We are all guests at the Festival of the Senses:
some of us blindfolded, some of us the dispensers of blindfolds.
No one comes here to the lichen throne (which seats four)
except the aging groundsmen with their scythes.
Their tattoos remind them of other, distant loyalties, past loves.
As do mine, but mine are all, in the conventional sense, scars.

    A jaguar sat in a tree. It was midsummer. The sun was shining fiercely. The jaguar was a golden color with plenty of brown spots. Then the ghost of Emiliano Zapata walked by. He was in full uniform, with rifle and sword, but in black-and-white. He looked like a cloud.
    The jaguar leapt from the tree and walked up to Zapata’s ghost. The jaguar  genuflected in General Zapata’s direction. Zapata pulled out his sword and knighted the jaguar. “From this day forward, this noble jaguar will be called Cuauhtémoc Xochipilli,” he said. The sun faded and set. It began to rain.

God wears glow-in-the-dark acrylic nails, her favorite color is obsidian black,

             she speaks loudly into her phone while munching on hot Cheetos. 
God carries a plastic bag with quarters, pennies & her passport cuz she knows
             most of her followers ain’t shit & removal proceedings are always already a possibility. 
God orders $1 fries, $1 cheeseburgers & $1 drinks at fast-food restaurants cuz
             a gurl needs to live & sometimes thriving looks like surviving. 
God checks her eyebrows on her phone every two hours & licks her index finger
             to realign each hair particle before meeting up with da girls. 
God walks into Metro PCS every three days for water damage services cuz she’s too often
             weeping onto her Android—M, Tu, W, Th, F, Sa, & Sun—the deaths of Black girls. 
God has hired a personal stylist cuz she don’t know no more how to be simultaneously ready
             for a funeral, court hearing, birthday celebration, anniversary dinner & the club. 
God has a Twitter account with 36 followers & it’s aiiight cuz she follows 794K folk & they

That’s enough memories, thank you, I’m stuffed.
I’ll need a memory vomitorium if this goes on.
How much attention can one man have?
Which reminds me: once I let the gas go on flowing
after my car was full and watched it spill its smell
(and potential hell) all over the ground around me.
I had to pay for that, and in currency quite other than attention.
I’ve had my fill of truth, too, come to think of it.
It’s all smeary in me, I’m like a waterlogged Bible:
enough with the aborted prophecies and garbled laws,
ancient texts holey as a teen’s jeans, begone begats!
Live long enough, and you can’t tell what’s resignation, what resolve.
That’s the bad news. The good news? You don’t give a shit.
My life. It’s like a library that closes for a long, long time
—a lifetime, some of  the disgrunts mutter—
and when it opens opens only to an improved confusion:
theology where poetry should be, psychology crammed with math.
And I’m all the regulars searching for their sections
and I’m the detonated disciplines too.
But most of all I’m the squat, smocked, bingo-winged woman
growing more granitic and less placable by the hour
as citizen after citizen blurts some version of
“What the hell!” or “I thought you’d all died!”
and the little stamp she stamps on the flyleaf
to tell you when your next generic mystery is due
that thing goes stamp right on my very soul.
Which is one more thing I’m done with, by the way,
the whole concept of soul. Even bees know what zero is,
scientists have learned, which means bees know my soul.
I’m done, I tell you, I’m due, I’m Oblivion’s datebook.
I’m a sunburned earthworm, a mongoose’s milk tooth,
a pleasure tariff, yesterday’s headcheese, spiritual gristle.
I’m the Apocalypse’s popsicle. I’m a licked Christian.

You remember the mermaid makes a deal,
her tongue evicted from her throat,
and moving is a knife-cut with every step.
This is what escape from water means.
Dear Colleagues, you write, for weeks
I’ve been typing this letter in the bright
kingdom of my imagination. Your body
is a ship of pain. Pleasure is when you climb
the rocks and watch the moonlight
touching everywhere you want to go,
a silver world called faraway. Dear Colleagues,
you write, this place is a few sentences
contained by the cursor’s rippling barrier—
what happened here is only beaks
and brackets, the serif’s liquid stroke.
The old story has witches, a prince in love
with the surging silence of women,
a knife that turns the water red. You write,
Dear Colleagues, now these years are filed
in the infinite oceans of bureaucracy.
Everything bleaches or fades. In other words,
goodbye. Sometimes it’s possible to walk,
although you’ve been told inside the oyster
shell of your heart there is no soul.
Creatures like you must end as a spray of salt,
green droplets floating breathless in the air.

Head rush on the bus, mind-boggle.
I pray for hemoglobin,
I—a moth,
lying on my mouth,
bleeding, like a motherfucker.
On (top of) and offensive in other words. 
Here you are, ahead of all,
the crow, craning, you glisten,
and drag, an infinite next,
farther ahead, you see and drag
farther, into a stairwell, a ladder, 
a lead in, to where,
a stairway, up to pfft down the drain,
from story to story,
upward and downward and heartward, 
here, you see,
stands my balcony,
waiting while beckoning to
black stones. 
The city a silent upright-piano wing.
You see the ravens pull together.
The eyeblink-moment’s armada.
You see the eyes tracking. 
Light, like the golden giraffe
of good fortune. Slight
in the anthem of your day, 
and how terrifying: 
head rush, mind-boggle
on the bus, I—lightheaded,
lingo, vertigo.

1

Letting the groove be what it is. Letting the sounds go where they need to go. Committing to repetition, committing to texture. Following mind and ear rather than form. Trusting self-oscillation. Letting mind manifest itself. Beautiful and filthy, from attenuated to expansive. Letting the drone open the feeling. Panning slowly over the landscape. Trusting honesty. Moving toward feeling.

2

The lyre is very old. From a time, too long ago to remember, when things were all one thing. The lyre and the voice doubling. The cycles repeating, breathing. But not tiring. The buzzy, rich sound. The wisdom of plant life emerging from the universe and meeting, eventually, a strange thought of kindness. A calm, weird peace in your heart whispering something to you that you had forgotten.

3

A kind of ensemble felicity following solidarity. Fuzz squishes the multiple concepts to a scale where they can interact differently. They recombine into a possible larger good hard to guess at. Rather than compete the usual way. You don’t let the fear direct you, but you’re not unkind to it. The helpful flute riff. The blurry moments. The gigantism of open-mindedness. Feeling what kind of person you want to be, and letting that guide you. A kind of strength that comes from unfolding layers. Flammable things that never burn. You travel by staying in one place.

4

Horizons have their own thoughts. There is the patience of evolution, and there is the practice of waiting for someone you love to return. Suddenly the sounds around you are vivid and alive, and the subway escalator squeak relates an engrossing tale with a green subterranean light coming through the gaps.

5

There is a fire boiling the tea and there is a moment that will happen just this once. Then another line of sight. There is a mountain that slows down motion by changing its perspective and a rain that disappears and returns. It is your doctor who has passed away and you become a peculiar kind of  health. The beauty of not getting in others’ way repeating in cascades of novelty, so you don’t overstay your welcome. Move toward it and it expands, move away and it splashes humorously through the surface into the sunlight.

Chased by Chinese troops, the monks
blinked like owls in the sun sheen 
abandoning their burning temple
where the obdurate slumped over altars 
with bullet-hole Third Eyes oozing
gunpowder and pineal, black blood. 
With blizzards choking the high passes
they huddled in the cliff caves 
while trusting you to lead them through, 
a 600-year-old boy, 
who was coming from behind his back
and was going in the direction he faced. 
The Chinese prowled behind like wolves
as snow squalls filled your tracks. 
As weeks passed, peasants and monks
boiled their saddled bags and ate them, 
drove yaks ahead to breach the snowdrifts
and then men when the beasts perished. 
By a blue lake in a Himalayan valley
where only the yeti had ever stood upright 
you meditated on the dharma path. 
Rinpoche, I glimpsed you once  
hailing a cab on Madison Avenue. 
Where were you going?

A good shepherd is a wonder in contrapposto, an artist
mapping the Serengeti with kingdom lines. 
A good shepherd angles a lion’s eye, traps gazelles
in dry fields, copies a cheetah’s spots one leg at a time. 
A good shepherd does not give you stones
when you ask for toast, does not ask you to work 
without a burning bush—but owns a gate, uses a gate, pulls
the weeds and leaves the wheat on an altar of choices. 
A good shepherd is a prince of peace when terror finds its full echo,
a creator in the wild where a predator, providentially, becomes prey.

nuit de l’enfer [hellnight]



I have gorged on a glorious dose of poison.—Triple blessings
on the advice that was proffered!—My guts on fire. Future shock
distorts and contorts and hurls me into the dirt. Choking and parched
I can’t call out. This hell, this eternal torment. Watch the flames
leap high. Out in a blaze of fashion. [  Je brûle comme il faut ... I am
burning in style ... and working through a verisimilitude of the now sprinkling the language changes so rapid and the syntax
so fluide we go to Style Council, baulk, a la mode, Vogue, “magic,”
le chic —]. So it goes, demon!
    Appalling glimpse of my salvation, conversion to justice [bonheur,
Delmore, bonheur! such joy such Plato in the quiver] and virtue [valor,
merit]. How do I articulate this vision? The corrosive air of  Hell is not
conducive to hymns. All those millions of sweet entities, insipid choirs
of spirits, all that nobility [“noble ambitions” per nobles ambitions which
echoes repeats refrains mirrors in the next indent of  Hell ... so should be
retained preserved as the chaos of inferno is like good order is like hanging
onto the little domestic tasks of washing and eating even when drink has
one in its grip, surely?] and courage and peace, and fuck only knows
“what else” [if we went for God Only Knows, rather than your “I know not
what else” to tackle Rimbaud’s “que sais-je” we are bringing the domestic
cat into the bushland and tolling the bell for songbirds and small reptiles
calling the feral in the cat the secular to the holy, and the condemning
is in our hands, not the cat’s paws {not claws}, surely?].
    Les nobles ambitions!
    And this still life is life still is ... well, fuck, I’m alive, still! What if
damnation is eternal! Self-destruction damns us, does it not damn it all?
We are creating hell on earth therefore we are in Hell? I offer my hand here—
join me in my selfie. Make community with damnation, makers, all. Our catechism, eh?! Damning parents who damned us and were damned
before they began to parent—drowned by the baptism. Pauvre innocent!— [Hell is a construction of the empowered to increase their power.] Hell has
nothing to do with the “heathen.”
    —Still life still alive, still! Relish damnation’s delight later, still. Quick-
smart, give me a crime to commit and I’ll fall into the unfillable pit via
Western law-making.
    Shoosh, shut your face!... Such shame, reproach, here: Satan is un-
impressed with my efforts at rage, so embarrassing, so “pas à sa place”
in the calque of salon conversation [LA- or Sydney-style? direct flights],
and the kitchen IS fucking hot.—Enough!... Amidst my plethora of
failings they despise, they pick out for special treatment my body
wash, inclination to magical thinking, toxic limericks. And over-
investing their lost childhoods they find a purity of truth in mind,
a refreshing sense of what’s just: such clarity of thought, such perfect
judgment,  je suis prêt pour la perfection ... Pride! I have psoriasis. Pity!
Lord, I tremble. It’s the thirst, the thirst that drives. It’s all childhood
it’s all the sensations of grass and rain and the lake-edge where water
laps over rocks to make pebbles, it’s the tall trees that spoke a language
we understood but lost and let them fall and said what a loss but not
knowing a way out kept doing what we were doing are doing, still,
and it’s the full moon the blue moon the blood moon the once and again— le clair de lune quand le clocher sonnait douze ... the diabolical bells sounding
the elegy over the lake the grass the sand at this hour, at this hour. Mary!
Holy Virgin!... Horror via my stupidity.
    Some honest soul out there would surely offer refuge, goodwill?... Help ...
but I have a pillow over my mouth and they can’t hear me as they are phantoms.
We think of ourselves in this plight we share. Avoid me. I stink of the world’s
burnt flesh, I am sure.
    Cascading hallucinations. This is what I am now: there is no grounds
to history, history is erasure and claims. I’ve no right to keep the facts
to myself: poets and visionaries will be jealous. [Herein a potential key
to the arts failing activism: even in the collective, some voices seek to shine,
and put in the self-defining seer’s mouth: poètes et visionnaires seraient
    jaloux

This story is a leaf that bursts out of
a branch, unfurls itself, lives for a summer,
and then dies. And it’s your face striking
me like the time of an appointment I’ve
missed when I notice it after all this time.
I fear a catastrophe that has already occurred.
The communication always went wrong.
Like we were under a bad star. Bad?
The star was festering. Coldness around
all of my love. There was a woman
who stopped me in the street to shout
in my face about the violence she’d seen
in me. Brake lights in the early mist
like so many accusing eyes. You did this. 
For a long time a man was dying,
making himself die, he couldn’t stop,
and we forgot, we did our best to forget him.
How can a person walk in a shroud
all the miles of their life. But how
can they shrug it off. We were searching
for a place of refuge for our love, but instead
the road led us to the land of the dead.

A statistician would say: of all the millions of ghost stories ever told, what percentage would have to be true for ghosts to exist? The answer is that only one story would have to be true.
—Burial



You can invest everything in someone. This one feeling chopping you up. Anyone can go into the night. I just want to be gone. I want to be unknown. There’s a storm coming. Euphoria trapped in a vial ... I was once in these mountains, the middle of nowhere. I used to get taken away. A lot of things were wrong, cold things, bad things. The weight of the decisions in you. You’d see these fires. Someone upset on the other side of the world. It’s like a Ouija board, it’s ... the devil’s face in their eyes, that feeling like a ghost touched you, like finding a body in a lift shaft on the other side of the night, even if you fight to see it, you’ll never see anything. I love rain, safe haven. Deserts, forests, people. I just want to be a symbol you alone could hear. Someone in your head. Everyone knows those sorts of feelings. When there’s nowhere to go, tearing through an empty building, the image of where you just were still on your retina. If you talk about it, it just sort of disappears

decadent deluge of dirge drenching skin, dandelions, & dirt. diviners say we dancing dizzy to the
ends of the world, dancing at the end of the world. to elsewhere. edging to
flight. let there be flight. & there flight be. we be a many-forked-tongue folk,
glossolalia-gurgling, crossing-&-translating-other-realms folk. apocalyptic glitch, we put our
hands on our hips, then put our hands in the air, hold our hands to the haints & catch their
iridescent feathers. oh haints, come true to us, come blue to us, come through to this
juke joint we call earth, this jagged jollification. we won’t jilt you. no, we
keep our dead kin with us as the dead kin have kept us the living.
listen, they can’t catch us, but they can catch these hands, these
moonfire spells to undo & redo, this fractalwinged explosion of this world, this
newness, this emergence—that isn’t actually that new at all. if we telling the truth about our
origins, this is quite old. blues old, which is bones old, which is dirt old. oh, yes we’ve got our
poems, parables, psalms, & our own palms as record that we’ve refashioned ourselves before, we’ve
questioned ourselves before. quivered with loss before. made portal of crisis & quantum-leap
rebirthed. bled & tended flesh wounds with rest & stinging medicine before because the material
without the spiritual & psychic does not a dialectic make. let’s get the rhythm of our feet, let’s get
the rhythm of our throats, holding a cosmic alchemy of tragedy & celebration that can turn this
thing upside down so that the sky becomes soil & soil becomes sky & dirt is what we seek for
salvation. verily, verily, when you get this rhythm, meet us at the crossroads. you’ll know because
you’ll hear whistling from the mulberry trees. you’ll smell them, too. & we’ll be there, perched. 
looking real xenial & otherworldly. we’ll be humming with the haints, conspiring about
going up yonder. going up yonder to be with our motherworld.

My womb was floating and I was on it
like the Jetsons.
Hysterical laughter
driving on a highway.
Under the bridge hysteria.
What is the womb doing now, hysteria?
And the blackbirds baked in the pie—
they not only had to die
but entertain the king. Poor things!
Like glass dipped in a barrel of oil,
and the Vesuvius of each tiny headdress.
And now I keep intruding on a conversation
I’m having with myself.
It’s irresponsible to despair.
And so I am hysterical enough for now.
Although I didn’t always know hysteria was tapping like a knife
all along the rim of my life.
I confess: I have so much practice in forgiving myself
even for hysterical gossip:
breaking into a greenhouse at night
and I can’t see what I trample.
The stalks shattered,
the pots of soil overturned,
and yet the fragrance.
Hysteria inside the never opened book.
Dear book, you with your stiff  love,
your breathless labors,
you who never gave birth to a reader.

At the Bronx Zoo



The cobras unlock their jaws into safety pins // Pick 
Open the locks of their terrariums & escape.  
The penguins throw // Student loans at women with Prada purses. 
So upset the thought // Of happiness existing anywhere seems insulting.  
The albino rhinoceros pushes // Open the gates of his captivity. 
How he dreamt of a road trip & camping in Yosemite.  
To walk in the valley & let waterfalls empty their bladders into his mouth. 
The ram rams open // The gates of his enclosure too.  
The apricot parrot // Sings the same song of struggle.  Anti-capitalism means // The rich can no longer // Control us with their laws.  
This whole fucking zoo will burst like a // Molotov cocktail 
Once the parrot sets flame to the aviary &  
Then a fly flies // Onto the spine of a gazelle // A gazelle 
Who’s lighting a blunt while // Resting her hip against the ice cream stand &  
The alligators are starting to pour margaritas. 
Alligators used to be enemies with the gazelle // But now they’re together.  
They hijack the stereo & start dancing to Selena’s 
“Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.”  
The pigs // A most anxious of animals // Stay locked inside. 
The pigs are feeling their badges // Hiding in mud & waiting for the uproar
   to pass.  
Here come the wisps of tranquilizer darts // Humans pushing giraffes whose 
Necks are craned in the shape of a // McDonald’s arch &  
Now we’re at the juncture where everyone suspends // we mustn’t  fold back to corn meals from the trough.  
I’m dashing to freedom // My cheetah crop-top // Turns me into a cheetah. 
My legs are pixelated in quick motion // Catch me   If   you can!

For Laura Villareal



     A mango fell from a tree into a jaguar’s paws. It was late summer. The  jaguar devoured the fruit and ran into the ocean. The ocean was turquoise like the August sky. The jaguar swam underwater for a few minutes. It smiled beneath the waves.
    Later, clouds began to form. The sun became veiled by the clouds; it began to rain. The jaguar swam a little bit more, but then exited the water. It walked back to the jungle for twenty minutes in the rain. When the jaguar arrived on its turf, it climbed up a tree and fell asleep. The moon looked like a summer mango.

It’s now within
an hour of sundown of a late
November afternoon. 
It was a beautiful day,
the cold burned
down any indignation. 
What won’t degrade:
the sick and distant, or near and black,
bad-natured tides of want. 
Jean Rhys is saying
If  I could jump out of the window
one bang and I’d be out of  it. 
It isn’t done
to admit to this kind
of  need, 
but spirit needs a house,
and the brief pageant of  being
escorted through 
the grieving joy of words
set down right. The cold bores her,
oppresses her. Life 
comes to bore her. She can strip
a thing down. I want
beauty, she adds. Hear me? 
I hear you, Jean. Yours is a voice
disabused; and inside the cold of  it,
there’s a sort of festival.

Beauty on earth so blue, even the cheese flowers
a culture with no democracy...    Yesterday (for example),
I ate the same sandwich I eat every week: eggplant
roasted in red pepper aioli, a focaccia jammed full
by arugula, capers sweaty in browned butter. How
have I come to love routine? I’m thirsty and abashed.
The fabric of my childhood underwear triple axels in the wind—wow.
The whole neighborhood watches me do emails, go to therapy: she shed 
revenge for forgiveness

Sure seems like IKEA schemes to keep me furnished 
with neediness, snagged by the cuff on greed’s unvarnished 
and snarling wood grain, then bagged in a crinkly vein-blue shopping 
sack ideal for laundry schlepping, DIY kidnapping, or wrapping, 
like some budget Christo, interiors just nearly formed 
but lucky for us, forests of fiberboard pine to be farmed 
and packed, hacked and hewed to exactitude. 
Hating having, hating having not, you’re screwed 
on both ends, like the first and last fastener of the IKEA 
LACK side table—a clean, Cartesian idea 
of carpentry, its figure abstracted three degrees 
from that poor nobody, buckled on knuckles and knees, 
who posed (the fable goes) as the wheezing prototype 
for our first table: he’d know whether the bowing top 
or the lack stacked beneath matters more, whether force 
or conformity forbids you to get up off all fours. 
Sure seems like my dreams of the perfect remodel, modish 
modules clustered flush, must speak an undubbed Swedish 
and what I’ll need is unspellable, zillion-syllable, 
an endlessly assembling emptiness that’s still 
not done until you dust its lacquered black. 
(It looks spectacular when lack looks back.)

Plain speech falling prey to full moons, myth
cresting through the ice. Dappled light, small
wonder. Tew-it, otherwise known as wandering
eye, displays the subtle, iridescent greens of his
carefully-preened plumage. This can work,
he reflects. Capricious order, domesticity as
an uneasy rest. As coagulant. Unearthly cries
drown out the common redshank, curlew,
each arrogant heron lording it on some nearby
log, the dull, incessant gossip of the coots:
chew-it, chew-it, chew-it.  viii 
One cloudless morning she let out a short, sharp
Peet, but otherwise they copulate in silence. Smell
of dirt, of warm feather, of dead worm, otherwise
known as aphrodisiacs. The way the light falls just so.
Lapwing, otherwise known as Tieve’s Nacket,
as Toppyup, as winnowing wing, ful of treacherye.
But we all tell lies to get laid, says the lapwing chick.  ix 
Otherwise known as the king of tact. Circumlocution
tricks left in a trail of dark feathers. Recorded
by the peeping ornithologist as valiance. Otherwise
known as second nature. We can all dissemble. Life
and soul, one-man party, likes a drink, up for a laugh.
See, no fuss. Heard first as a weapon, lies more closely
resemble a bedtime story. A drawn-out cry for help.  x 
Fear found as flush as a clutch of speckled light,
sown spring, enough for a basket, otherwise blown
clean crest, a cap for a babe. Some precious
quartet laid open for all the world and his friend,
for some Saxon notion of betrayal. Laid on the slake,
the comfortable scratch of dead grass. Decoy, snatch,
the endless cries of alarm. Swooping as redundant
motion, birth mistaken for a harvest.  xi 
Otherwise known as failed utterance, how successful
can the lying hornpie really claim to be when faced
with the report: threatened, decline, in the red. Try
winnowing through those metaphors. Tew-it,
otherwise known as plover, known to his friends
as lappy, chooses not to bury his head in the sand,
but rather to drag his beak through the earth
in concentric circles to create a great hollow world.  xii 
Otherwise known as lore unto himself.
Lapwing. Such intellect, such grace, such
promise, that killer voice—the kind of reedy
tenor tipsy birds can’t help but fall for at a
house party, at picnics and evening jam sessions.
A clutch of partners, of habitats. Otherwise
known as a mosaic. Peet-Peet-Peet, otherwise
known as itchy feet, otherwise known as wind
change, as vagrant, as story keeper. Migration
offers endurance, novelty, otherwise known as
the hard-won maintenance of a myth, as survival.
Dissemblance as another breed of song.  xiii 
Known first as prodigal, cracked shell, survivor
of drought, summer son, otherwise held up
as miracle, as proof of the decoy nest. First
felt as Cristatus, sole endured, first and only
to leave, as bare-crowned, damp crest, as not-
yet devoid of all faith. There could be no witnesses
to marvel. Gratitude told as a readiness to flee.
Each writhing meal, the wet-nosed dog, the circling
hawk. Cramped conditions breed contempt, the cruel
weight of sibling love. Expectation, like a cuckoo
taking shelter in the crudely scratched out nest.  xiv 
Hymn for seasons. Hymn for every frame.
Hymn for births, deaths, and migrations.
Hymn for each mislaid babe, smashed egg,
snatched chick, wing trodden and crumbled
underfoot. Hymn for the cold. Hymn for
the gone. Hymn for every imagined ghost.
Hymn to ward off approaching catastrophe.
Hymn to know it. Hymn to acknowledge an
over-eagerness to feel besieged. Hymn
to recognize threat. Hymn to stay still
long enough to see it approach.  xv 
Lapwing resents the accusation that never having
to exhaust every problem, every possibility, never
having to stay, means never having to discover
the hard meaning of care, of  love not as a feeling,
but as a labor. There is labor enough, labeled
as necessity, labeled chance, in simply staying alive.  xvi 
Brother, cousin, uncle, mate. Otherwise known
as excess baggage, as dying weight. Stillness as
a series of parries, otherwise known as the long
meaning of eschew; the same pronouncements
repenting of themselves over many years. Stillness
felt as forgetting what it means to be anything
but quarry, as collateral loss. Plucked up and restless,
Hoopoe and the gang make tracks, head south,
attend to their needs, loop back. Love as contraband,
flight as freedom smuggled over invisible thread.
There is no stopping them. Otherwise heard as no one.  xvii 
With numbers in such sharp decline, with the state of
agriculture as it is, with the increased conversion of
arable land to pasture, with the use of increasingly
large machinery, with the sale of  land to developers,
with the melting of the ice caps, with rising sea levels,
with habitat destruction, with weather phenomenon,
with the drainage of wet grassland and the continued
poaching of eggs for the seasonal menus of expensive
restaurants, with the hot weather leading to the early
cutting of grass for silage rather than hay, with the
resurgence of Brideshead Revisited reenacters, with
the gradual but irrevocable estrangement from those
formally known as his flock, tew-it is forced to think
about legacy. Having no solicitor, tew-it, otherwise
known as peet-peet-peet, otherwise known as Vanellus
vanellus of the family Charadriidae, acts as his own
executor, draws up his estate: twig, feather, fluff, dried shit,
corn husk, dried grass, clod, some calcified, some not. Tew-it,
otherwise known as Lapwing, otherwise known as progenitor,
cries out the names of his surviving issue: Peet-Peet-Peet.  xviii 
Some plastic tag, some earmarked ground, some
ready-scraped nest. Lapwing’s young reserve
his gilded cage in twitcher’s paradise. Protection
order, otherwise known as clipped wing, otherwise
known as death knell.  xix 
Litany, otherwise known as requiem, otherwise
known as send off. The last of a dying breed,
up for laugh, king of the preeners, iridescent in
his own light, the mourners peck, as they flutter up
and down on a great, invisible trampoline. Loved
in absentia, lore abounds in the hairline cracks of wings.
Father, bounder, besieged. Euphemisms fall around
like feathers. Lapwing, otherwise heard as panic,
otherwise heard as parry, otherwise heard as parent,
otherwise never seen, lays low in a neighboring field,
prepared for his readmittance to the party.  xx 
Otherwise known as no reply. As silent heron,
silent hookwink, silent coot. A clear Peet-Peet
shrilled alone in a fallow field, otherwise known
as devoid. Knowledge felt as drained pond,
louring sky, slaked grass, flushed clutch, as
otherworld. Lapwing, transmuted, remains
unmoved. Vision begets sound begets touch
begets flight. Tew-it nestled in comfortable
obscurity. Hoopoe culled. Pees-wit shorn open
with the yellow crop. Knowledge as throat, as
beak, as orange foot, as sheen. Knowledge as
exacting science, as lapwing, otherwise known
as lapwing, otherwise known as lapwing, otherwise
known as lapwing, otherwise known as nothing.

She snaps the heads
off dried anchovies,
their eyes a black
ant hill burying my toes. 
I’m breaking doenjang
with the flat head
of a metal spoon,
stirring the boomerang
silver bodies she drops. 
Whenever she feels
like showing up, we cook
together. She opens
the tofu, smashes
the watery curd with her
foot, and soaks 
a package of dried kelp
in the trash. The brittle
pieces like unspooling
magnetic tape. 
Today, she sticks her white face
through this seaweed curtain,
red lips smearing,
whispering look 
look this is just like my hair.

Pines had been singing but fell silent having been felled, now
           droop lacking impulse as do wires, satellites hang over—
unseasonable insects too
stop their stridulating: did voluntary children leave
                     who’d rubbed sticks, unsheathing
grassblades in their fists to squeal amidst squeals of delight;
or when lipping at a double reed,
           mocked-up deer
frisking aslant of slats of light and dark, were 
taunting the gods, majestic throngs leapt despite themselves:
                     Then it was your voice
           stripped bare, Marsyas, even when
acoustically dead in the skin peeled off and calcified as
           if a shell,
shell stolen by the dissimulating birds that cracked it open,
                     so vengeful!
groaning when tender life within its spiral doubled up,
phantom squeezing by its warm wall,
           when plumped on a pillow stuffed with their journeys,
bolstered by the trees’ sighing reminiscence,
you cast round conspiring to take back their songs:
                     had their repertoire come to seem
too predictable, were the strange poking beaks heard to goad 
you as you wrestled on your back your needle robe:
else flat twang of gut strings stretched across a hollow gourd,
was that so to speak sonorous enough? Here at
           the far limit, pulsing? Where I am all ears?
                                                                              As was. 
           Slats fix up a stroboscope, deer flicker
bounding through attendant pines, dream machine heats up,
                     but the fledged will have requital
instantly in tumbling scuppered onto earth,
the dying song inaudible to one who hears his own cries only,
ear cupped to ear.
                     Come over to this part.
The lens you train is frazzling its specimen. A wall of silence
behind the panorama,
                                             tongues of fire, taunts you.
This I saw, and my seeing holds the scene in its amber varnish.
            Now. 
           His ears quite pulled was his skinful.
           His skin zoomed to his middle ear.
           He was happening on their thought-things
           He was happening on their myth-things/
                      on those sigils
           porch denote, a tended herbal plot,
           mare loitering beside a zinc trough,
           a worship’s cloud shape-shifting to perplex
           the upright set to rob him of his
           dead spectrum heart,
                      pierced with pings and probes,
           O it hurts me so, that it does not hurt,
           the lack of hurt discountenances.
                      It screws me up that as I mount
                      I go under.
           Sands of time trickle and their fragile
           cone heaps high,
                      bonding in its own cement
           happiness of objects it had made fond and
           oft engulfed, greased with blood
           keeping them in play,
           dodging in between bracts.
                      Lackaday. I take forever for my time.
           “In lofty mood I mount the reeking box,”
           the centrifuge sequence grinds,
           flicker box revs up,
                      lees consolidate,
           this heart’s plug feels impermeable.
           Feel it? Feel the thumb-rest?
                      Lights along a distant rim flicker.
           A waterspout
           smacks down from a thundercloud,
           tornadoes score papery soil,
                      crushing keepsakes in cones,
           a clay hexagon from Palmyra
           ten centuries BCE.
           He bindeth up waters in his thick clouds,
           hourglass trembles in his hands
                      for now is time pitching over,
           time inverts,
           now’s time, past time, time it must be,
           hourglass mills mace and conch,
                                 his residence
           offs from under, no iota escapes. 
Now if the secret relative, the disjointed hero turned inside out
as certainly bound to do,
           once woken to say his piece,
once mixing it
amid the crackle of aluminium cans, those canceled trains
starting forward, joining up with people in the room,
                     he must be touched, really—
           if where a finger stops he shrinks and squeals,
where the finger flutters, helplessly squalls,
thoughts not his own disseminate like needles all haphazard: 
touched he can only sing, touched he pitches out
           endless longing in a macaronic of Greek and slang,
listening for his noble voice, hearing only cries of the dying—
pick them up, the shell-like lobes
                     throb as they squeal on deck,
that slippery, sustainable deck,
                                                        such remnants
shall the creaturely world animate, their pipes sound in unity?
           Breathe a zephyr over ice floes,
           sight-read their scattering before a hushed hive.

May my transmission throw unstinted nimbus, fracture a cell
to leak its thinking-through,
                     conforming to already-strewn scores:
           those brilliant Aztec shafts,
the shattered painted dome, soon their splinters recede,
           and in their place a faint lemon-yellow blur,
                     a new sun
back-projects onto the outshone day,
sigils of the birds insecticides had killed, feathers plucked,
cockaded on pennants
flapping slit along the path to the Museum of Natural History. 
Touch Here dissects their songs, touch dawn and sunset flight
plotted in real-time on-screen,
                     hear, see, kill out of prevision.
Are all put to death?
Elusive yet a zigzag insect scribbles, self-erases,
                                     neither here nor there,
one thing or the other lives in consciousness of scalp or ankle,
skin sending signals in advance,
           did you hear their fuss?
Dying within hearing, dying past hearing, dying to be heard. 
May my transmission glorify each wandering, singular flight.
                     Release came before its time.
Rupturing the screen, predictive codes bounce in plastic tots,
set out rows of analgesic,
           recapitulate hiss of gas in unison with what
sounds alive in trees, red dust sifting between bare branches
                     Neither here nor there.
           Eyebright, you too, reticent against the path.
                                   Aperture. Crosshairs.
Quit the session, pack up, and feel your flesh prickle,
feel advances when called in:
           It is the score they know, they cannot help but respond. 
No mosquito is where we think it is where its mote dissolved
           in full sight, consciously in skin between my fingers,
misidentified as in a dormitory,
nor lit upon a boy jackknifed in a closet, unmissed.
                       Imagine dangling like some flap—
           a penis or false nose, a glove
flies buzz inside, vibrating like foam memory,
the master stroke a wasp nest keeps time with,
           mastery a snake strips in sequence to:
its bandages of yellow skin keep a barber’s pole in their twist,
                                     must mast for all to see.
Marsyas’s trunk too. His mouth filled with insects.
The forest slumps lumber, horizontal in its poles and sleepers. 
May this transmission taste sweet if on the palate metal fizzes.
                       He wore his heart on his sleeve,
one more political factory—
his kidney was that four-stage filter a horde
funneled through—
           you recognize for what, this multitude, this army—
           he sprawls in his termite couvade,
tumulus to a gang of target cells, switched on to assemble
SQL and Python columns, file home to their
                       forest compound—
           depositing a trail of crumpled faces, the mask
of surveillance stripped and stripped, a bare-faced
hide hangs and resonates out loud, he’s got to respond to that— 
           stretch his scalp for a great drum, thump the ground
riddled by the thought of maggots going about their business.
Larvae that never will be flies.
          Parchment where the worm glyphs burrow
silently, as it has been written.
Swipe now. Its yellow glaze intensifies.
                     Swipe again. Just try once more. Soft
instruction squirms beneath a screen protector.
Think you can compete? As birds take flight before the archer,
one flies down a fire break dodging scorching breeze:
                     and the auguries that fall
in our circle, that deflated orb each holds to their face
           like to a mirror’s mockery,
scatter needles in unread scores across the sterile O-horizon. 
The misbegetting Gods fuck in beach-huts of a cement Lethe,
deaf to insects, by a reedless, unwaded pool:
           they ring the pool,
darkness so intense dazzles, light thick as Chinese white,
a glaze smothering light even in emitting it,
hisses at high frequency. Sheer extinction.
                     Sheer
magnetic force, its field a basalt slab:
                                   they turn toward their sacrifice,
hand in hand, hand in the concept of a hand, hand in his idea,
           they have a hand in his hand. Therefore
gloved, if once his thigh is touched it will explode with child.
Or so it ought. All falls quiet. 
In their defeated circle wind cannot rouse or steer to so much
as a faltered gust, nor stops squeal against breath.
Birds drop lumped on needle stooks.
                     Advance, hero, play your part.
His canopic vessel sounds. Letter A the impress of his voice
           burnt out. 
Ruined cities melt to glass in intense heat, theaters
bake to bricks in an earth kiln, flutes thicken,
sinuses of mortar,
           only lost blood hisses from a severed ear.
Stars have been expressed, but he will lie still akimbo,
                     ungloved, dispersing in swarms.
He kicks the shew-stones and little universes break up.
Clay hexagons bide the pool whose ripple will translate them.

The chair I chose for me and the chair I chose for you were at a table behind a pillar where I hoped we would not         be seen or heard or smelled or tasted by the women who no doubt were         licking their spoons slipping spoons into the sides of their tights toothpicks in their hair         you came late with a light         step your head a balloon on string          bobbing statically somewhere near the ceiling         your legs listless thin trailing the floor         some men ooze sex and it has nothing to do with their bodies          you were not pretty do not think you are pretty          middle-aged man with no hair with cuticles gnawed down to the rat beds         but when you shook snow off your coat using your shoulders alone when you yes         then every woman in the room stopped rubbing salt         between her fingers remembered her own desire moved the stolen spoon in her tights front and center every woman understood why the girl in floral headscarf had come early and tried out all the chairs         why she stood up when she saw you sat         down stood up and sat down stood up started to cry         you said me too        kissed the pearled hood of each eye in turn before you laughed and laughing snorted so she would know you had once been a boy.

           —You prick too liberal into alien pains,
and read too readily a grief  you need to see
in order for the world to be the world
that ratifies the choices you’ve made.
You talk of callings, but a calling should
enlarge the life that it refines,
not grind its spice into some same mustard. 
           —If  we could see the grief of any one life
it would be slag enough to crust a world
and any feeling being buried within.
But grief’s a craft like any other, it seems,
if only indirectly ours:
our skin’s inscripted with what nature knows.
The dead child chiseled in that woman’s cheek,
the battle smoldering off that old man’s brow,
our very mirrors, friend, these aging faces
with their lines of  loneliness like pressured ice:
you would have them silenced? 
                                             —I would have them whole. 
           —As would I. As would anyone
whose life is lit, however dimly, by the light
of survival. 
           —I fear that by survival what you mean
is resignation, or, worse, a fictioned oblivion,
like the bull elephant that has outgrown
the stake that it was tied to as a calf:
it can’t break the rope that it could break
with ease. 
           —And I fear by wholeness what you mean
is merely the will to leaven fate with will,
that constipated sorrow called good cheer.
I won’t relapse from these mild dry lines
whose only consolation is their dryness,
that one might utter calmly utter blood.

my mother had two vaginas
one to birth me and one to keep me
inside the first one I had two names
my given name and my other given name
my twat had a name too
it was forgotten because the climate changed
the climate changed because of  God
obviously
we as a society
stopped naming our twats
the old ways make way
for some way of  being again
in this world where we bury the old
inside their baby bodies
this way when we wake up from our dead sleep
we shall be little bright stars
dead to the world and dead to the love
our teeny tiny gods created
their cunts hugging so tenderly at the moment of creation
that I think this world was truly made for us
still we won’t live forever
we won’t know how to tell the others
who will have surely lived like we lived
inside the total darkness of their mothers too
where it doesn’t matter what we know and what we do not

There are easier ways to die happy.
One day a monkey wrench zips through a store aisle
begging for contact. The next your lost love finds you
dehydrated in the food court. Isolated,
these incidents teach us the wrong lesson, leaving
only the personal hunch to keep scouring the junkyard
for rare samurai swords among the moldy viscera
of old food and metals, but through fusion
you begin to comprehend the use of random coherence,
like an electron. You think dumb words like “fate,” pick
your spilled body off the cold tiles—bump
on your noggin, kinda woozy—and a council of heads
floating over you asks, “You all right there, bub?”
which is the sonic cousin and connotative villain
of babe. You feel like someone pleasure-reading
in front of a live studio audience, that is, meta, and even more so when it airs
and you’re there to see how stern your eyebrows and forehead
look, as if you were trying to read the backside of the page. 
It says, “If you can read this sign, I can’t see you”—
you, the novelist whose protagonist shares your name,
asserting your non-existence; you, sneaky as the p in raspberry,
building statues of avalanches for a figure drawing class;
or you, blasting Schubert in the Whataburger drive-thru,
condescending to your sandwich. You are a composite
of shit, memory, and nightmare, and the lines between them,
within yourself, blur like lighting when you blink. 
If the mirror were see-through, the empire of invisibility
could train your shadow to be a ghost. Instead,
the road explodes into an octopus of paths,
a lone flame sparked in the center, and you don’t know
which to take. Your magic trick?
Inventing a new magic trick. Pain gurgles back up
the garbage disposal, helplessly whining, “Water,”
encouraging indulgence in confusing image systems
meant to make you think about yourself
when you’ve done nothing wrong. This whole time
you thought you were nerfed by verdict, allergic to insight,
you were actually compromised by an affinity for falling up,
as the meadows that blurred into bushes and blankets
became prototypes for a new kind of landscape,
while that central flame made fire angels of the grass. 
Of course you want the landscape to glimmer,
but you can’t ignore the thousands
of dried-up seeds and scorched roots, and farther out still
some frozen in ice so dense no light could penetrate it enough
to splash them awake. Move out from behind the camera.
Use your hand to block the sun. You’ll see
the trenches in ruin from pole to pole
and only the occasional flashbang from beneath the dirt,
giving you occasion to feel effulgent against the field
but wishing it were greener still—full of fucking flowers!
you can’t believe you think to yourself, you derivate scoundrel!
yet you are here, examining the meadows of dirt, trying to
think of a new word for green. 
Like I said, there are easier ways to die happy.
You could squint through the spyglass backward like a straw
and roll the map peeled off the globe onto the table,
trying to flatten out the sides in denial of the warped world.
Does it look ugly to you, in your head, where you can privately
explore the extremes?

The earth said
remember me.
The earth said
don’t let go, 
said it one day
when I was
accidentally
listening, I 
heard it, I felt it
like temperature,
all said in a
whisper—build to- 
morrow, make right be-
fall, you are not
free, other scenes
are not taking 
place, time is not filled,
time is not late, there is
a thing the emptiness
needs as you need 
emptiness, it
shrinks from light again &
again, although all things
are present, a 
fact a day a
bird that warps the
arithmetic of per-
fection with its 
arc, passing again &
again in the evening
air, in the pre-
vailing wind, making no 
mistake—yr in-
difference is yr
principal beauty
the mind says all the 
time—I hear it—I
hear it every-
where. The earth
said remember 
me. I am the
earth it said. Re-

All us girls we agree to be big teen
islands scouring the slips for who came
closest. I tented my sour girl with boy-textured
leans from the could-have bin. Couldn’t let out
what lived in the back with all the trouble rubbing
at my tender. A girl’s sight becomes real
in the flee, her thrum of  identifying marks,
private seams, marbles of  fat for the pillage.
I meet myself at every mask collapse.
Like the old wounds slack on my hiddens I was
the danger I exchanged for my hair, the song
I rubbed against my song.

What happens to a heart after death? 
It pounds around the rib cage,
at last leaps through the sternum
into the menacing wood. 
Grows a coat of fur, thickening around the neck.
Becomes crepuscular,
cannot bear to be seen. 
Crumens beneath its beautiful eyes
secrete waxy tears,
its four-chambered stomach barely taking in sustenance. 
From spring on its antlers grow an inch each day,
velvety at first as they emerge
but hardening to woody bone for the anger of the autumn rut. 
At times the stag tips back his majestic crown;
a Christ with hands nailed up, he bellows to the heavens,
then sheds his antlers and begins again. And again.

You wanted to
have vision
but the gods 
changed.
You wanted to feel
the fraction of the 
degree of
temperature
enter the 
water, feel the
minute leave the
minutes 
behind.
Why not be
happy. What are 
they doing
to the minutes.
Each one takes 
that minute of you
away. Takes away
hope. We stand 
around, we have the
sensation we
dreamed the whole 
thing up, we
didn’t, & all
around us how alive 
rot is, & damp that
never ceases kissing
everything in- 
discriminately—yr
hands, yr skin fixed to
fit everywhere tight, 
yr lids holding yr
gaze, the rubble, the
anti-microbial skins, 
the layers of cello-
phane, the rare &
treasured paper 
sack, everything
delivered up to us
as if spectacular, as if 
an emergency of the
spectacular,
& new data-sets showing 
more new hours days debt melt
scars faster rising than
ever anticipated, 
also those fleeing
told no no, not you, you
are not allowed, where 
are yr papers—oh
those—I know we
gave them to u but 
here u see we
change our mind—look,
here is a changed 
mind, a mind whose house
burned, here is
melted chromium & ash 
where yr life was—stay
calm, listen to
authorities, re- 
build, imitate, believe,
wait, b/c it will come again,
over the ridge, the 
licking flare, as if
pure hunger, or
curling all over u now 
the fire of the
flashlight, don’t move,
I beg u, never 
move, figure out
what the they is,
what the they wants— 
pretend it’s laughter, it’s a
refrain—pay up—as for the
recent past 
it’s got too much history
a mind can
set the match to—but see, the fire 
prefers not to die, no,
& we oblige, we feed it, we
keep it 
unpayable.

Day, you
and then the eve of the evening. 
From the balcony, sliced light
leaves behind an arm. 
Shadow,
in which you for bleeding chrissake put yourself out. 
You look through the glossy-black,
see into the continual flux,
churning up
inside outside side-to-side;
an effluent running river,
insect-filled,
and one truncated tree— 
no square in which to sleep;
you write a brief note. 
Change it. 
Classic, you think,
as you slide 
by means of the motion
in downing the fingers.

The body and its members sway in time with the blood’s beat,
its willing course. I brought the doves to the marketplace
in a wicker basket, to honor the museum’s anniversary.
The shock of recognition effaces the particular, oaks, stones,
each bearing its private inscription. Say a poem is like that,
a bit of silence the world acceded to, for a finite duration.
Say a little bit of everything one takes into one’s hands
remains, the pot smeared with soot, the Mazzolino canvas,
the ripe pear with its pesticide sheen. No other way to play it:
I had begun again, disremarked by the other guests
who stood around the floral displays, talking so animatedly.
Outside it was raining. In my pocket the stub of a ticket,
a pause my fingers idly groped. In the corbels, identical beasts
devoured one another. And I thought, yes, it is like that,
as much as any thing can be like another thing; I thought,
the canon of matter is so vast, it keeps imprinting
its judgments on both guests and hosts. For I was a guest,
as I kept reminding myself, striding away from that dim town.
I copied myself into the legend, not with the strength
of iron gall but such that others, who would come after me,
might scrape the surface and apply their own insignias,
their own ludic anthems fleeing to the skirts of some Welsh
saint, as if she might protect them. As if she understood
their language. And in the negotiations that followed,
the tense exchanges (hollow apart from their brackish rinds),
a tongue precipitates. It is made of flesh, i.e.
it is what I say it is, not merely an image, a trope.
Imagine what a surprise that must have been: a living tongue.
And her gripping half of it, and he gripping the other
half. And the world readjusting all around, as worlds do.

The Book of Doves opens to the Chapter of Bridges.
In my youth the most frightening dreams
involved turbid water, something beneath the muddied
surface, something dangerous that remained
unseen. And I was staring down, from a high bank
or some fragile or else broken span. Dream of arches
and of the blind dogs that prowl their stolid footings.
It’s time to offer gifts again, to whomever you like.
Because we have lost the Book of Gifts,
from which we might derive more perfect knowledge.
At some point those dreams ceased, for me,
and others took their places, the restless song service
that will never quite begin, the endless queues.
I place the drugs back in their silk sack, I add more salt
to the grinder. Thus do some days carry their ashes
outside, to the clean place. A cycle is restored.
We can be men and women again, though not without
risk. You may read about it in the Book of  Tongues.

And I think he must be drunk, from the sweet way he.
Brother. I think about his XX all the time. It’s like a joke,
that we’ll start dreaming of men once we. My favorite
version is the one where we. We ate citrus on river rock
while others swam out. Stern lady cop found us out-of-
towners naked, our clothes scattered around pine root.
Dampened for days. But he. Inclination surges
through window screen—that wind, you’d think
                        we’d found ourselves in beach town.
If I had the chance, I’d go right to the root of  him.
Shouldn’t I out of anyone feel it with my main medium.
I think there’s something happy and right about us mating.
That night how you. Chest flying. Tonight my house creaks.
Somewhere swings open a gate we all know we all want.

I didn’t know the details.
I feared the details.
I loved the details. 
The details, said etymology,
were our first cuttings. De-  tailor, did you know
where you came from?
From taliare, to split:  talea, a stick
companionably unstuck. 
Long enough to look
at the realities
of luck: 
wishbones,
each to one’s own 
taste of it, what’s enough.
In Sanskrit: talah, wine palm,
and in Greek: talis, 
a marriageable girl.
Dividing / 
divining back
as far and old as Thalna, 
goddess of youth 
to the Etruscans, fresh
as any branch begins as 
some loose, unlikely
end of a tendril;
some cleave of a leaf.
___ 
In details lost and found,
there were days of games
and days of fasting 
and although these
were the same days, 
days of feasting
were interlaced like
so many flights of birds 
in that certain composed,
but hurried, hunger. 
How often was it content
to be contested, paradise?
Paradise rained 
into failing soil?
Paradise evaporated?
Did it ever pick up? 
Before starting over new
as a people, the Etruscans, 
waiting 18 years in their old home,
Lydia, gathered half their number—
plus whatever wits they honed 
from hungry days of dice—
and moved.
___ 
They say life is more than starting over.
Maybe it is, Sun.
Maybe it is, Moon on the pines, 
your practiced light on dark,
silvery green needles 
before there were leaves;
before leaving,
the common grace of nights and days 
left to each. Left to search,
through founderings, 
for findings,
whichever can be moved; removed;
replenished or replanted.
___ 
In the beginning of a history,
Herodotus told his story
of the Lydians 
and their famine
and their wise ruler who decided 
there should be games,
games to keep the peace in place
in the turmoil of  hunger. 
Games on days
when food could not be served. 
Playfulness and sustenance,
for however long, happily confused.
Herodotus himself didn’t know 
that the Lydians were Etruscans
in their old life, before the move 
to land they would be known,
and renowned, by. Mystery
finally solved, to the letter. 
Mystery, all the same,
remains in its remains. 
Herodotus,
would you be shocked
to know what DNA can say, 
stretching back through hindsight,
all the way to wonder?

money will build anywhere
there’s a view or a coastline
all those tangled shrubs and thorny bushes
your ancestors cut through centuries ago
to claim in the name of a queen
and a king with foul smelling hair
these days even the ecotone
between the living and the dying
has to be privatized & sold at auction
all the steps between next year
and the first human year ever recorded
melted so flagrantly it became stylish to be poetic
for the end of the world
everyone’s collecting coins on every interface
a thousand identical posts about 2019
being the year of paper straws
and reusable cups
indigo dyeing from Kyoto
is the new 36 hours in Tbilisi
all the people with phones
don’t think twice about buying onboard wifi
on their way to the latest Caribbean island
still recovering from last year’s hurricanes
would it be so wrong to wish
everyone with global entry be grounded
until extinction is off the table
I don’t think I can date another
digital nomad or a normie with a dog
who doesn’t know what it’s like
to be too poor to buy their way
out of disaster
why do the rich treat blame
like it’s obscenity
or a fossil
is it because they hate seeing blood
think they are noble for taking
quick little showers
and using silicone at the farmer’s market
I have never seen someone forgive themselves
as elaborately as the wealthy
everyone who paid for their wellness
is infecting the rest of us
yes I am sick sick sick
and want to sterilize all the ruinous overseers
though it is not like me to dream so much
I have managed to hoard something
that cannot be replicated
it will die when I die
let no one say we didn’t try
to let a different kind of  life bloom
and let no one say we didn’t touch
what was there from the beginning

             This neighborhood map thrives on rising sentences,
arbitrary Icterid with signified arms; Ventriloquist!
             shook-throated, a rock-hard reed-lance thorn by the landfill—
a bird almost-mistook-for erasure shared in a thin migration,
             like marauding packs of boys who fight or make out, discover song, hinge:
on the talk or sheen of feeling, grass-rooted as if contra-the-wind enough to prevent erasure?
             Its moat of fear, reinvented burps, throbbing streetlamp burst on the fritz,
the self-appointed-like throat, chewed on ambition, held choked as a corn-flavored chip, 
fed and left to dust the milk of the park, where seaward, another earth throws shade:
             the moon, almost, or a hurricane, we dawn and we signify our own sentences’
justice, justice, built on migration from conjugations the winds once institutionally appointed:
             at last—this hurricane!

Look what it is to have forgotten
the torn coat of  “Vecchia Zimarra”
from Puccini’s  La bohème and to remember

and look what it is to give your own coat away,
three times now, and to walk shivering
in three different countries, oh tears
for the opportunity and tears for a horse,
all bone on a hillside without a blanket and
him laughing at me because there were no tears
left for a freezing gracehoper.

For Lucie Brock-Broido



It was delivered to me in the snow. 
The kids were all sleeping
in separate corners of the house
like unfound crystals. 
I wiped the flakes off,
holding what I thought could save me.
My neighbors were afraid 
I was disappearing. The branches above
trembled with hidden birds.
I didn’t know. I read and kept reading
the label 
until you heard me.

After most of the bodies were hauled away
and while the FBI and the Fire Department and NYPD
were still haggling about who was in charge, as smoke cleared,
the figures in Tyvek suits came, gloved, gowned, masked,
ghostly figures searching rubble for pieces of people,
bagging, then sending the separate and commingled remains
to the temporary morgue set up on site.
This is where the snip of forefinger began its journey. 
Not alone, of course, but with thousands of other bits not lost
or barged off with the tonnage for sorting at the city landfill.
A delicate tip, burnt and marked "finger, distal" and sent over
to the Medical Examiner's, where forensic anthropologists
sorted human from animal bones from Trade Center restaurants,
all buried together in the Pompeian effect of incinerated dust.  
The bit of finger (that might have once tapped text messages,
potted a geranium, held a glass, stroked a cat, tugged
a kite string along a beach) went to the Bio Lab
where it was profiled, bar-coded, and shelved in a Falcon tube. 
Memorial Park—that is to say: the parking lot behind the ME—
droned with generators for the dozens of refrigerated trucks
filling with human debris, while over on the Hudson at Pier 94
families brought toothbrushes or lined up for DNA swabbing. 
As the year passed, the unidentified remains were dried out
in a desiccation room—humidity pumped out, heat raised high—
shriveled, then vacuum sealed. 
                                                            But the finger tip had
a DNA match in a swab from her brother. She was English.
30 years old. She worked on the 105th floor of the North Tower.
The Times ran a bio. Friends posted blogs. Her father
will not speak about it. Her mother planted a garden in Manhattan.
In that garden is a tree. Some look on it and feel restored.
Others, when the wind lifts its leaves, want to scream.

The salseros, the real-live soneros,
the palo-players that gang-busted
dancehalls with fish-crate yambú;
the tumberos who recorded the earth
in clay jugs, whose steel-beam shoulders
held up skies until shing-a-ling
floors were occupied by the perfect
fourth of democracy; the quintets
that crashed baptisms and plucked
concert hall from park bench and
band shell, who glittered airwaves
without commission, who changed
their names from Joe Loco to Joe
Panama, Joe Ponce to Joe Cuban, who
Castkill'd then Corso'd, who 
vamped it up and whistled evil
out of garden—their Africando

Almost nothing has changed
about the world. We're still bound
to go on having this hunch 
everything has left us or is waiting
for the worst possible moment to do so. 
It's still our custom as a people 
to measure our lives by our longing,
our longing by our treasure, our treasure
by the little pieces of jewelry 
we let slip out of our hands
and clink down the drain, gone forever.
The prevailing theory is that if we try 
hard enough an entire history
of diamond stud earrings will gurgle
forth, as lonely for us as we are for them. 
The airplanes of America disembark.
The passengers look up, sensing the first
inch toward that next city.

purple trumpet blowing
high notes at the sky long

We're balancing the heat of the day
on the tops of our heads, walking
along the shoulder of the road
to the new liquor store for Cokes,
which she said would take fifteen minutes tops
but instead is taking over an hour.
On one side, a field of cotton, ready
to be picked, thick and white
with loosened bulbs; on the other, hard dirt
and nothing, then a ditch, a road, some
morbid-looking piece of farm equipment,
and in the distance, the rise of the interstate
and the woozy sound it makes.
In loose reference to a conversation
we've been having off and on all summer,
she says, "Okay, what if we're already dead 
and this is heaven?" The question hangs there
in front of us. We walk through it. A car
passes us from behind, and the hot breeze
hits the backs of our legs. The road curves.
Far ahead, the liquor store flashes
its bottles of booze. "We're here," she sings,
though we're not there and won't be there
for another ten minutes. Between us
and the store, the road waves its fingers
of heat. Beyond the store, the road gets thin
but doesn't disappear. As far as we know,
it goes on forever.

I save my love for what is close,
for the dog's eyes, the depths of brown
when I take a wet cloth to them
to wash his face. I save my love
for the smell of coffee at The Mill,
the roasted near-burn of it, especially
the remnant that stays later
in the fibers of my coat. I save my love
for what stays. The white puff
my breath makes when I stand
at night on my doorstep.
That mist doesn't last, evaporates
like your car turning the corner,
you at the wheel, waving.
Your hand a quick tremble in a
brief illumination. Palm and fingers.
Your face toward me. You had
turned on the over-head light so I would
see you for an instant, see you waving,
see you gone.

Ask me, Poet, Did I love her?
Breast against bristle, penny eyes—
I loved Rose the way fours
Exchange blows, the way fractures
Need islands, the way we tremble
In the glow of dead-ass truth—
You wanted to stay awake 
Just to see the end with her. 
Guardian, gladiator & goon—
Skeleton-to-ash—speak, dead.
Forget, always. Ask me again,        Did I love her?
With holy-mouth & hard-hand,
I play like I say: Yes. Yes I did.

Unless hot lunch at school
was serving something special
like corn chowder
and baking powder biscuits
or creamed chipped beef
potatoes and brownies
I went home
to what my
mother made
like most town kids
 
Jack walked the furthest
almost to the river
to his unpainted house
by the railroad tracks
We all knew nobody was there
his mom at the tavern already
He always came back
Just in time for the bell.

to love life, to love it even
when you have no stomach for it
and everything you’ve held dear
crumbles like burnt paper in your hands,
your throat filled with the silt of it.
When grief sits with you, its tropical heat
thickening the air, heavy as water
more fit for gills than lungs;
when grief weights you down like your own flesh
only more of it, an obesity of grief,
you think, How can a body withstand this?
Then you hold life like a face
between your palms, a plain face,
no charming smile, no violet eyes,
and you say, yes, I will take you
I will love you, again.

Migration is derived from the word “migrate,” which is a verb defined by Merriam-Webster as “to move from one country, place, or locality to another.” Plot twist: migration never ends. My parents moved from Jalisco, México to Chicago in 1987. They were dislocated from México by capitalism, and they arrived in Chicago just in time to be dislocated by capitalism. Question: is migration possible if there is no “other” land to arrive in. My work: to imagine. My family started migrating in 1987 and they never stopped. I was born mid-migration. I’ve made my home in that motion. Let me try again: I tried to become American, but America is toxic. I tried to become Mexican, but México is toxic. My work: to do more than reproduce the toxic stories I inherited and learned. In other words: just because it is art doesn’t mean it is inherently nonviolent. My work: to write poems that make my people feel safe, seen, or otherwise loved. My work: to make my enemies feel afraid, angry, or otherwise ignored. My people: my people. My enemies: capitalism. Susan Sontag: “victims are interested in the representation of their own  sufferings.” Remix: survivors are interested in the representation of their own survival. My work: survival. Question: Why poems? Answer:

Near noon in the city in the park
in the salted air in the cold cringe
cringing two hands glued red
to my cheeks. I give away comfort to get it back.
Oh, look at the sun, I must say to myself
over and over, so that I might look at the sun. 
I rent a language guide
to hold my hand
while I sit sneezing
in home’s direction—I am
far away. But I can see
the ocean: not so far. 
Nine children on the playground. Ten trees
planted in a row. So nice
to be a swelling sleeper,
thinking at a jogger’s pace. Bees
born from my fingertips
burst toward all the dying life.

After Alexandra Petrova



Trace your son’s left hand
           against construction paper
                     with a nontoxic marker, 
           teaching him the edges
of his bones. Then fill
            the space between 
                     with what shines
           or powders, glitter,
crushed cheerios, flecks 
           of skin even, teaching him
                     his bones remain
           in spite of it. Let him try 
to fit his fingers in the contours,
           teaching him his bones
                      keep growing. And when 
           he makes two fists, afraid
his body can’t keep up
           with what’s inside, clenching 
                      hard as teeth to keep his bones
           just as they are, to keep them
from sprouting out, tell him 
           of  Ukraine’s oldest apple tree
                      that grows its branches
           low into the ground 
until they drink the soil—
           an indiscernible colony
                      of roots or eternally new trees. 
           And when he falls
asleep pressed to your chest,
           trace his right hand 
                      against the tree-house
           rib cage it first grew, teaching him
the endlessness of bones.

An arrow does its own form of singing I like to believe
this means nothing          is ever too far
from the bird that it was   I tender the dark
with a hum we cannot die in    a legion
of spells for the Black boys who learned
to make the light sorry     All I have ever wanted
is to be the wound you neon
All I have ever wanted is to die beautiful
in hands I could mistake for yours
All seasons are becoming the season
of my isolation   The green sputters long
into December so I think we are all less invested
in loyalty these days     O you gilded Amistad
the mouth I’d forgive without question froths
with an armada of golden-hulled ships    Excess
I too pretty the interruption when I cannot bear
the elegy any longer     I don’t know how not to love
what would kill me without noticing     I can be
ferocious with my ugly  I can be the knife chanting
silver through the abrasion     I wish I could write
of you as something that would break if I held it
living for too long     O grief-cousin    phantom-chain
wind-throne    blade-choir   What is death to the children
of the forgotten     One day too my mother will die
and my loneliness will be a hyperbole of ravens
all of which will sing like fugitives    Glory   Glory
how much I’ll miss her

Pues   es possible que I have learned to fear la lluvia
All of my saddest stories   have the same beginning
Entiendes?    One thing falls into another  I am fallen 
Into all the time     Men enter me like rain
Swing the moon in their hands   until I’m mud
I suck their boots    beg them tranquilase tranquilase 
It was an accident mostly   to have lived this long
I regret the entry   but what choice did I have
Men shove their weapons inside me and only I 
Ever think to call them bastard   All I have ever
Said has been blamed on the wind   como una
Mariposa    I am beautiful because I am surrounded 
Guapísima     I am cherished most by the blade
Yo soy la prima de la tormenta   What rages
against me   used to keep me alive entiendes? 
Es possible que every storm begets women
I am only what memories were buried in me
So I can’t say what’s buried elsewhere 
Una país is only as good as the saddest acres
Of  its deception      Nobody can tell you this
Better than la tierra itself       That night it rained 
They dragged them off the road    El poder de
La tormenta  es en el oscuro y los manos
I howled for a country    I’m mostly made of ghost 
Stories and rumor       The men entered me
What choice did I have but to suck their boots
For this crime   they have only ever called me citizen 
I tremble when the rain comes    De verdad
When the soldiers came back    I mistook the headlights
Of  the truck for lightning  The thunder for acres of batons

in the entire state of  Iowa
how many people speak Ixil?
question:
is despecho the music he plays

& is despecho what it sounds like
when you cross one strange country
just to land in another & discover
all your words for love are strange & unfamiliar?

so when i walk down the street, i hold hands

up ahead & a sky so honey, i could almost taste it.
a cat struts away from me & two yellow eyes 
become four: just like that,
i’m the loneliest creature on this block.
soon the streetlights will come alive
& television sets will light up with blues. 
stay with me. while the sky is still golden,
hold the ladder so i can climb, & from
the highest rung, i can scrape away a drizzle
of light to wear around my neck. alone 
is the star i follow. in love & in solitude:
alone is the home with the warmest glow.

You want a piece of me
to see, from the flesh of me,
a flesh from within me
no one’s ever seen, not me,
nor the mother or the lovers of me.
A piece that will have been me
but then no longer me,
instead a synecdoche of me, 
or possibly metonymy,
a figure of speech of me,
in contiguity or association with me,
a part for the whole of me,
a sliver that once was me,
so you might perceive the end of me.

 formed shapes she had not met before. Green
  time laid its fragranced landscape before them.
   So they entered. Married. Irene came soon.
   At eighteen, Gussie was widowed, with a
    toddler older than her youngest siblings.
     The family’s hand opened and closed
       in welcome. But fingers remember.

Not long ago the Pope decreed
that unbaptized babies would
no longer be banished to Limbo
and that their little souls languishing
there would be released
Imagine them getting the papal memo
and rising in unison   unsure
of  where to go
except up       twirling like colossal flocks
of  river martins
in dark enormous coils     their outlines
becoming eventually lighter
then translucent         then clear 
We might guess incorrectly
that the accompanying sound
would be the usual celestial
harps and choirs
instead of  the intolerable shriek
that trapped breath makes
when it escapes from a balloon
whose opening is being pulled taut
or tens of thousands of these 
Sebastião Salgado talks about traveling
through parts of  Brazil
where babies died so frequently
that churches rented out coffins for their funerals
and reused them dozens of times
A local vendor might sell bananas
and ice cream alongside shoes in which
babies could be buried
         Salgado also says that when
babies end up in Limbo
it has something to do with whether
or not their eyes are open or closed
when they are buried
              or is it when they die    I’m not sure
       The transcription
of the interview is unclear 
When someone in a movie dies
with their eyes open
the lids are made to look
so easy to close
A priest for instance or a doctor
passes a reverent hand
over the corpse’s face
perhaps not even touching it
and the task is complete 
The morning you died
our friend and your brother and I huddled
in your bed with your body
that overnight had decided
it was no longer you
but some awful machine
designed to lurch and wheeze
until it sucked in one
more breath and did not let it out 
Your eyes were open and when
after a few minutes
no one came to close them
I tried to do it myself
but the lids kept popping back open
like busted window shades
that wouldn’t stay down 
The word limbo derives from the Latin
word  limbus      a border         an edge
It also is a dance   that also is a contest
in which the winning dancer
is the one who doesn’t fall

We’ll affirm its arrival
when it’s not in the titles
of recipes in which it figures
quietly, as moderate slivers. 
When it’s always available,
not lumped with root vegetables
nor flecked with blue mold. 
When everyone knows
not to bite the large pieces. 
When everyone preaches
the best means of peeling
(knife, spoon, or not-peeling)
and disagrees, without violence. 
When its unexpected absence
causes fundamental hunger
but it’s like running out of sugar:
you can ask any neighbor. 
When the nation remembers
how it treated as barbaric
the eaters of garlic
as they fled persecution 
and sees its reflection
in black-and-white photos
of  mobs against risotto.

Shake some action’s what I need
To let me bust out at full speed
And I’m sure that’s all you need
To make it all right
—Flamin’ Groovies, “Shake Some Action”



To have arrived here, weighed down with fistfuls
of calendar entries, unsuitably
boggle-eyed as if new—
so these are mountains,
there is horror, which is the subway line
where I may lay down my creed
and when will my breath stop
acidulating like this?
Exceed, said 27. In all things exceed.
Shake some action’s what I need. 
27 was animated
but has lately been absent.
With them we raved and with them
came. A dervish verve escorted them
always, which now I feel dribbling out
like the cruel juices of the steak I didn’t feed
on, didn’t slaughter, wouldn’t want to but—.
In a dream I asked permission
and 27 agreed
to let me bust out at full speed. 
That was a dream. The juices a memorial.
At present, I’m perishing—
but mayhap not right now. You too?
Something immense is unwinding a spool of wire.
You trace it and find, what else:
Death on the end of the strand like a bead.
To have arrived by spoonfuls of undecisions,
to have arrived knowing you only fled.
You drool over a bowl of soup, snorting greed
and I’m sure that’s all you need. 
Mayhap not sure. Mayhap
doors swing open even after juicelessness
and soup. They might open onto tigers.
Or a vision of  The Real True—
after the shakes yield to a long loosening stare.
Take hold of the knob: You’re bitten or you bite.
If I, yet untoothless, can chew up despair,
I’ll take a good calm look at the dark I’ve been given.
Is that where I’m headed, with my hairband-searchlight
to make it all right?

Genghis Khan, my father says, using a soft G,
Never saw our peninsula with his own eyes.
Don’t quote me on that—
Recall isn’t my strong suit. I’ve convinced myself
Memorizing dates, for example, is outmoded.
Better to learn the overall movements,
Social conventions rising and falling,
Empires and their changing mascots.
Genghis sired so many, they say, his children’s
Children’s children’s genes sowed an entire
Continent of grasslands. If  you press your ear
To my blood’s topography, you’ll hear hooves
Pounding, though I can’t remember when it started, or
Whose king it is coming in the distance.

Grandmother remedies & such, absent. So, in absentia, I blind-
Knead the knots in my own back. Pressure point in the palm

Rejoice in the snowflowers in the veins, rejoice in the bathtub
saltwater clogging the windpipe, its brittle sugar- 
crystals in the lungs, in the petals blooming in the water
after curettage, scarlet rash of ornaments O globular berries staining 
the porcelain. We pass the darkened library on the way
to my mother’s house so the kids can light advent candles— 
I’ve strung Xmas lights to the wall with a Stranger Things alphabet, Ouija to the upside down I’ll scry 
I’ll scream to contact her—girl I heaved
into the toilet bowl, girl I let go each time a man 
fucked me [over]. We pass the library past dark
& the librarians form a line under the exit at closing—I imagine 
habits, I imagine knives for teeth, typewriters for hearts.
The librarians jackrabbit. They devour the dogs. 
My children at my mother’s table love Jesus. The plants
in my mother’s kitchen still bloom on the sill 
while my mother’s tongue wilts on my blue altar &
even Frida from her Santos candle glares in disapproval— 
I’ve drowned them. The leaves blanch, a sick mucus,
a bulbous wax. A loaf of soggy bread around my belly & 
thighs in the milky soapwater I scrub & scrub the pinkening
of poultry I’ve become. There was a hairbrush once, a broom’s 
handle. There was a channeling in a tunnel, O burst O pop O clank
O fuck my swollen bell of  brain. If no candles light 
when we scratch the match, has God forsaken? Where
have the librarians prowled off to—with their curses? Once upon  a time a mother lost her goddamn mind. I scrape the blackened foil
from the cake I’ve burnt O baby I carried to the ledge. 
I’ve brought only the living ones to pray [for strength]
for when their mama hollows a wall, marrows a bone & 
the headless girls return to her & the bodies rise like steam 
from her chest & she flings her rust, her knives & uplifts
the blanket of ribcage to the cavernous tomb of sky.

R.I.P. Robert Poston (1891–1924) and Roberta Poston (1924): husband and daughter of Augusta Savage



Our love still young,                              our marriage new,
  Robert and I                                      felt blackness as
    a second vow,                                 a spiritual seal
      between two souls                      who spent long years
        before we met                          wondering if
          we would ever                      find each other.
            Now we were one             and would soon bring
              a life into  being.           A new
                beautiful life,             a black life,
                  we would love        and bring into the
                     Fells family.       Irene’s sibling,
                        a new Negro  beginning.
                          Robert left on assignment
                            to write about Liberia,
                            a foothold in the motherland.
                           He died at sea. Pneumonia.
                          The last letter he wrote to me
                         said Africa   doesn’t want us.
                        Garvey was in  prison for fraud
                       (faked charges).   I was carrying
                      the child I wanted   to share with Robert.
                     Roberta came              early. Grief was
                    our midwife. God          must hate Negroes.
                   Why does God make        our luck so bad?
                   She lived ten days.             Is this the worst?
                  Is worse coming?                  What is the point
                 of making art?                           Flowers on graves?
               Dancing in masks                         to placate death?
              I don’t want it.                                 I don’t want art.
             Take the gift back.                             With everything else.

Violation
Wildflowered up the dreams of my captors,
Decorous men, half-moon bedded in my bloodstream.
The object is without objection. It was said
Such knowledge sharpened the Garden’s blurred shush.
The serpent also whispered in the field.
Abandon, the house of the lord, is
Abandoned. Its painted columns leer behind my heels.
The yellow apples underfoot, the flies they waste. 
I am entering the wood.
The goat goes with.
A panic trills, and though the trees throw their limbs
I have no stupefaction for that flute.
I have poured salt in and already set fire to the cloth.

After Lucille Clifton



O winged walker,
motley brood
& brood underneath
the underneath. You,
formidable residual,
derelict carried
to this country
by the dread Atlantic
wind. What did you see
to make but yourself
& yourself? Foul
architect, teeming Queen
of rot. Whereas you
survive. Whereas your death
is an industry. Whereas
on the television
in this century
of television
a woman wears you
as a living jewel,
rubied carapace
on a gold leash.
Whereas beauty
was never meant
to be your name—
O harbinger
of harbingers.
O little, unending night.
Whereas murder, too,
was never right—
they’re just a sound
for what we do
to the dark. O
a sound I fear
is the only sound
I know.

This unfamiliar place, if we succeed in figuring out what’s going on, could
be the locus of a secret. And it might, assuming that’s the case, then convey
certain things, things we cannot control, things that are fatal, voluntarily
uncontrolled. We need to find a compromise between what we control and
what we provoke.

     urge to touch & try its
I want to say ductility;
             ductile: might have meant easily led
     but doesn’t—so it appears to stream
down her forehead & nose,
              sweeping to gather
     at her right shoulder, hang more loose
upon her left, edges embroidered
             with a homely button pattern drawn
      across her breast al cielo e al tempo ...
             A marble veil. Corradini’s specialty.  ii

          The United Negro Improvement Association,
        he says, his little bloodshot eyes looking out
       of the dark shadows of his overhanging black
   brow. His eyebrows quizzical, halfway to a smile.
And over them, an uncreased expanse of dark brown
 brain-cover, broad enough to maybe mean genius.
     He talks and talks, a baritone that somehow lilts,
    the Jamaican vowels a soothing music, talks and
      talks, how we are Africans wherever we landed
             in the genocidal kidnap, we belong to each
            other as siblings, all Africa, all Africans, together
          as one nation. We will return, we shall return, the
     Motherland waits for us, she is calling to us in the drum-
beats of our hearts, he says. Don’t you hear it sometimes?
I have to say yes, I sure do sometimes, remembering how
   sometimes I have smiled at insult and injustice, toed the
       yassuh-mister-charley line. Don’t forget a whole continent
       hopes we will return with what we’ve learned, what we
       have become, even our language, our words, even our
images, even our art, he says, is more theirs than ours. Light
falls from the windows through the antique lace curtains onto
a mahogany table set with his collection of antique porcelain.
             His cheeks are silk sleek, his thick lips talking, talking,
the necessity of self-emancipation, only we can free our minds,
think about going home, feeling our Ancestors welcoming
you from the very soil. I smooth gray layers on the wire frame,
       watching his face, watching my fingers. He gives off
       black light, impossible to capture in my medium. Genius,
      genius, yes, and authority. Confidence. And there’s some
      madness in there. I stroke the curves, the heavy jaw, the thick,
      soft lips speaking hymns of affirmation. Something deep inside
        me makes a little ding, like a tiny chime. My black pride
        has awakened. My cramped and crooked inner light
          creaks straight. Those little eyes. That grand ambition.
            I cover the bust with a damp cloth. Same time tomorrow?

More oblique the eagle’s angle
than the osprey’s precipitous fall,
but rose up both and under them dangled
a trout, the point of it all. 
Festooned, a limb on each one’s
favored tree either side of the river,
with chains of bone and lace of skin
the river’s wind made shiver. 
Sat under them both, one in December,
one in July, in diametrical seasonal airs,
and once arrived home, as I remember,
with a thin white fish rib lodged in my hair.

In a bleary part of town,
I traverse the blackboard silence of snow. 
Through the slats of the cypresses
Flounce paper-white feathers of snow. 
On the red leaves of my palms
Distend melted messages of snow. 
The road is iron anvil
Stinging with sparks of snow. 
My nocturnal heart thrums
In white wasp whir of snow. 
Moonlight purls like nectar
Sweetening the blandness of snow. 
Glaucous berries hang from the rowans
Like frostbitten pearls of snow. 
Mice hide in the lee of alders,
Shirking the cold tusks of snow. 
Shadows vine like crewelwork
On linen twill of snow. 
Around your black spade pupil
Lurks an avalanche of snow. 
I wish you’d toss your cards
Like fireworks against cumuli of snow. 
Instead, my name catches in your throat,
Congealed in its amnion of snow.

I can do anything, so I try yoga nidra
to see if I can find him.
He’s been dead four years now
though I tell people when they ask, two. Just two.
My mind refuses what it wants
even if I haven’t lost anything.
One day I caw like a seagull
swooping in for a long dive.
Another, I am hunger waking up the bear.
Today I go to the trees to listen
and he is an old cedar, but sweeter than that.
When I was a girl, I knew I’d never be a girl exactly.
He was the only one who knew it
and let me run wild, would never tell the others.

Wist is wetness
and why, wind,
why. Go and gather quickly
before every shadow
has dispersed to everywhere
but beside you. God governs only
what happens while
it happens: this want
is wine of  your own making.
Loud the quieter times, and quiet
loudest still, and reach
and reach the branches that tree
beside your bedroom window,
growing to grasp you though felled
ago no less than half a decade.
How a day so dear and treasured began
with a fist in your face. Skin-to-skin.
Even the memory of that sound, somehow.

Younger, I could go to my friend
when her heart had been pierced 
and she was gasping for breath,
and I could tell her, nothing is lost 
entirely, all experience
in time becomes a window. 
She was twisting the wheel
of  a wooden toy. I’d said more 
than I believed.
Two blocks down, fine pins 
of  ice slurred the brackish water, slowed
the small waves, until on a last 
heave, one
froze, a sheer shell 
in the dark between the reeds.
When I search 
my journals for her,
who melted from my life, 
I’m searching for you, and for this
special faithlessness, I apologize; 
there are so few people
in those soft covers, so many 
descriptions of our four rooms—how they remain
the same, tall and old, quietly beautiful, 
and yet change utterly as the sunlight
fills and abandons them on a clear afternoon. 
Today was cooler. A high film of cloud
calmed me; a letter and an offer came. 
Though I was tired, I brushed varnish on the floors,
let it thicken, then buffed it until it glowed 
with cloths cut from a green flannel shirt
my father sometimes wore.

Considering Sylvia Plath’s “The Jailer”



You have been burning
the cork of yourself. You crawl
the nightboards bare-assed, scratching Negress against the grains, leaving fingernails
in invocation, dabbler, out out 
your damn mind, summoning a phantom
the shape of my granny—that peerless apparition—
her halo of witch hazel and snuff,
her knuckles cracking the whip kept tucked
away in her attic like a hush of bastard fist. 
You slip her on, hot to be hazed
dressed in a distinct leather’s stink.
The gaze of a husband who hates you less
bears down her living midriff, sniffs her
out as he would a bloom 
of mold in your basement, its dank
souvenir. What blood ensues is the pink
in my palms and patter of rebel in my neck
when I, having slept wild again,
awake. About impossibility: 
I am not unsympathetic. I get it.
He beasts you and you feel a need to pass
the buck. In my house, we call this
nothing much after all. When Freud
observed Verschiebung, he wasn’t looking at us, 
how we assault the air with grudges
avoiding talk of our learned tortures.
I will not flash you the rattling quarters
of evening my mothers crowd inside
to seek their penny-wide retreats; 
I’m going to unfatten your pockets.
Remind me again of your ghost ration.
What if you could eat your fill?
Have you? Haven’t you had enough?
What would you do, do, do without us? 
In the poem I’d conjure to carry me
across the finale of my animal life
I can ride no skin but this one.
Sweat stifles its cells until they fungify. 
The night choir-sways down my throat’s red aisle.
My muscles flaccid in felt ventriloquism.
The vessels sing a sequence of chains.
They chew through my confessional face. 
My mouth lopsided as a fainting chaise, 
My mouth clack-clicks back to work my teeth 
Latchbolt into a snigger:     tight     bright     luxe  enuff sighs the blue smoke the grin
cuts out of my bottom lip enuff

Go to the window, open
the window, outside
the window 
there I am with you
lying down, in the dead grass,
reading you a sentence as long 
as my life line. You kiss my
forehead, I kiss
your simian crease. 
Go back to the kitchen. Go back
to the magnets. Touch the wood handles.
Touch the spoons 
left in the sink, a sliced lime,
a juiced lime. I won’t wash
anything that isn’t mine. 
The nightjar eats what it eats.
The wide wave finally arrives.
The wet moon leaves me so lonely. 
You can’t tell me what I want or don’t.

These mountains have stopped
swallowing men & spitting
them back out
 
 
bruised by what
they’ve seen & done.
The men are gone
 
 
litany of used

I believe
in the body, not its resurrection.
 
 
while I want to die 
quickly, I want my body to linger as long as it can.
 
 
Make certain it’s safe enough, deep enough,
square enough to hold my eternity.
 
 
People are real friendly, but they’ll leave you alone, you know?
 
 
There is no way you can bury me
without entering the earth yourself.

Personification is inevitable. It goes hand 
-in-hand with reinventing the wheel.
It reeks of misfortune. Gives a mess 
its mass. Is why slime
never forgets 
its shapelessness,
while memory 
foam must, in what doesn’t leave
an impression. My memory spins 
our negative capabilities round,
round, like a record the dead 
once held, as if listening were human 
invention. Imagine someone who only touched
needle to vinyl. That generation who lost things 
as memories, while I run from thunder,
huddle inside a train long gone 
off the rails. I call for an Uber. A call
I did not even place. It’s all part 
of this new deal, for which I am the delay.
Oh, blissful ooze. Oh, quantum soldier 
of fortune. There will be an app for judgment
that we can’t delete. You correct me:  execution. Let’s get into this. That sentencing
is quite empty. The sentence is doubling 
down. Computerication is enviable. I’m pretty
beetles you’d like to stick a pin through 
& then trash can. Why care
for the shepherd tricked 
into the slaughter pen. Let’s get it out in the open.
Herds. Human. Break. Bliss. Silo. Haze. Quant- 
ify looking forward. To tomorrow, to block
me from negative space. Mince this 
tender. Say slime can be a crown
of onions & it cries into my eyes. 
Say chop away at wing & antenna.
Say leave me alone with my own 
device. Say I’ll refuse rubber shell
& puckered mutton. I try & reinvent 
new spin. It’s a table with too
many hands in it. It’s communal 
as plague. It’s that you were invented,
but came first. The wheel who’ll originate 
the hands that spin it. Say they only reach
a single herd so milky & sweet. Say it grazes 
from beneath the screen,
free of my cutting board, 
where you’re filtering all
of my chemical elements, 
until I’m a looted grave, a generic
greeting for the slaughterhouse & 
day of rest. Say until I press
the air 
like a switch
& ask: when. 
Say you keep all the bells
tolling & line every fence 
in the schoolyard with birds of prey.
Say no car can escape into spacecraft 
or credits.
& you cut 
to blank,
cursor still 
swarming over
whatever dares next.

When the wells dry up, my mother is taken
to search for extraterrestrials in the desert. 
The location, like her real age,
is undisclosed. No fake Prada 
stores, no high-
altitude balloon 
conspiracies & no reception. The call, in a sense,
ends the moment I try to claim the apple 
never fell, never fell at all, from either tree. Aba asserts: breathe & then warns me she doesn’t like the word alien. 
I know this well enough, how my mother knows
well enough, that deserts are not prophecy. Or 
a graveyard song for an animal
sanctuary, somewhere far-off, 
founded on second-guessing.
Like it ever mattered which 
side of a fence or war-
head to the last rhino 
left, when he’s blessed with two armed
guards to protect him from everything 
but thirst. Over static, I hiss it’s too late to save
face

If you want to know the answer to everything—
& by this I mean how to land on the moon 
styx, the smallest of pluto, just to stick
a wreath in its water-ice 
& leave, without even taking
a photo—then I can tell you 
I too got it wrong, giving all
my attention & ache & ardor 
to the electron, who’s too busy binding matter & clearly
too stable, holding our heads up & keeping our hearts 
in the dark. The electron looks after reality, keeps it going somewhere & doesn’t peacock with mystique, no, that’s you 
pitching salt as you cross the black cat
with a ladder. That’s you & another 
you who have so little belief
in each other that youronly 
bond is whispering Macbeth in the dark 
theatre & rattling
every full house 
for hours, every hand dropping a glass & turning
into the toss of a breath, sleep no more, no less 
than spinning a parasol indoors with one sock on, both shoes on a table.
That’s the unbinding of a human condition. That’s eyes straining to see 
less, before the mirror that breaks itself
every billion years. Think carefully now, 
how you2 are never in the same room & when “you”
are, it’s the only refuge & the other is intruding. 
It doesn’t matter who wins. It’s what can’t quite
end: what is not a thing at all, but a disturbance 
that does not exist
until it’s discovered, 
& yet when it appears,
it ceases to be? Because 
that’s everything, I promise. It’s just *you’ll  * never
have it, since the photon is not receptive or self- 
evident & yet the answer to yourtrillions
of moons that orbit swift disturbances. 
But look at you. Look how even
if {you} get the smallest bit 
close, {u} creep & cant
that they circle urown dust 
& hands, busy sticking everything
with cut flowers & wedding bands. 
As if a surface
digs itself deep 
into the light  u believe *u*
grasp. As if there’s no other 
evidence that life did,
at one time, flash before 
its own
divine.

Still, I keep myself, I take
to bed. One lung is red. Cut red
flowers hung in pink water. 
My other lung is out of  line.
From one lung, I tell the truth.
From the other lung, I lie.
Cut pink flowers hung in red water. 
Like a pain, the truth is mine.
The lie is that today I want to die.
Cut red water hung in pink flowers. 
The rest of it is stillness, rest.
A soft cough into a hard pan.
A hard cough into a soft plane.
Cut pink water hung in red flowers

The body, like a crowd, moves without a mind. Moves without
an ambit. Tilts without an axis. Pulls without a magnet. A school
of fish could tell you that: the wind is more a rudder than a mast.  2 
The body, like the mind, moves in crowds. [A worm, or wave,

[The wave, a solitary iteration of] the wind. [The kiln is thinking itself

The body moves with [a] crowded mind. A worm or wave could tell
you that. The worm [with the mind of a] fish. [The fish with the mind

There’s sunshine with blueberries each morning   I sing fortissimo most evenings while we cook   This is a poem
about joy   It’s not neat   My ex-husband had a rare condition
that made him feel fire ants were biting his face
eyebrows first   then the rest of his body
It flared up many times each day   The only way
to calm it was to wash   He had bottles of water
in the car for this purpose   He was convinced
that objects were cursed  because when he touched them
the itching started up   He wrapped these things
in plastic bags   phone   wallet   documents   I helped him
to hide the problem from clients   Our house
was a Turkish bath   steamed up from all the soaking
of  skin   clothing   backpacks   cameras
I tried to be kind but sometimes wasn’t   Paper and fabric
were breeding grounds for fire ants   My books were all cursed
We couldn’t hunt for second-hand gems
or browse antiques   My coats were a problem
Worst was my black Ted Baker one   thick wool
belted   bat-wing sleeves That  fucking coat   It’s in my new wardrobe   five years
since he walked out   —1 am—   but still it seems
polluted   Near the end   everything I owned
was infected   I couldn’t touch him and if  I did
in error   he’d flinch   as though a toxin
had brushed against him   get up with a spittled I swear to GOD and spin to the sink
He’d splash his face   because my hand
touched his   He told me three times in nine years
that he loved me   I had to ask   He wouldn’t go
to the doctor because when he did once try
in LA   the doctor thought it only dry skin   He was
sensitive to smells   He’d cover his mouth and nose
when he was next to me   It snowballed over years
so that secretly    —we were so good in public—
flopped on the sofa   I came to see myself
as a sort of slug   It was important
to pretend to be confident   There’s not enough here
about blueberries   And did he ever   once or twice
hit me?   Throw things?   Bruise?   I forgive it
or try to   He wasn’t sinister   not like
that other man   the one who tried to rape me   in a high room
an office   I’d thought   not an apartment
I’d been looking for work
when it happened   He threw me   rag doll down
and was unshiftable on top of me   A cannonball
on my pelvic mound   I’ve never been so aware
of that bone   I couldn’t kick or twist   Por favor
didn’t work   I thought he’d strangle me   saw
what a murder victim sees   I was a gnat
in his web   I sometimes think I’m still
as dispensable   I don’t know why
he allowed me to run   to that Catalan
backstreet sun   pulsing   clammy
and spinning   I still had the nous
to note his address   —33 San Vincenz—   but felt
stupid   Estupido    I looked up the translation
in the back of the police car   I thought
that the word would help   He wasn’t in the first
photo ID line-up   but was in the second
Ecuadorian   square faced   I took the Metro
to the far side of the city both times   and again to meet
his lawyer   The police had little English   My Spanish
was poor but I was trying   His lawyer asked me
how I ran from his apartment   Was the door unlocked?
And I knew that what she meant is “Was I free to leave whenever
I chose?”   Yes   she was a woman   his defense
I was free   not locked beneath him   not pinned
to the sofa   bone on bone   Our bodies aren’t legally
double bolts   I left when I chose to   left behind
his deep eyes   grizzly hair   Would I still
pick him out from a line-up?   There were photos of his wedding
on the mantelpiece   He had a toddler in a pram
a little girl   and wheeled her to a bedroom
She didn’t cry but must have listened   I think
I was lucky   Sometimes   I catch myself wondering
where he is now   if we’ll meet   This is not
about my ex-husband   his itching   It’s about
separate hurts balling together   a handful
of snowflakes that tumbled down a wintry hill
and after that another hill   another   until they were
a monstrous boulder   encrusted with clods
and rocks   blackened   besmirched   I came
to see myself as a slug   I wouldn’t lean in
to whisper with friends in case my breath was rank
He said it was   No one has agreed   Still
this is miles from blueberries   I sing  scherzando
unchained   when I cook with my partner   We laugh
at terrible wordplay   Nerdplay   Our life
is truer than this poem but I’m trying   Like most families
mine has tales of fierce women   who suffered
but had to get on with it   and kind   tender men   People
who coped and can’t tell me how   They must
have sung   gossiped   mucked in   There are many
ghosts in this poem   I’m one of them   As I write
there’s a dunnock on the bird feeder   It’s been flying
back and forth   from the hedge   I wonder how they manage
little birds like that   with sickness   Life’s cheap
A gnat in the web   Pointlessly
living each second in joy   The sun falls creamy
on the table at breakfast   Milk splashes up the sides
of my bowl   I think we should sing  fortissimo
even if it’s complicated   Lately
everyone’s been taking a stand   This poem
has given me nightmares   The room smells of coffee
cinnamon   blueberries   two and a half scoops.

After “Crush” and a line from “Pachinko”



                    
                    Every evening, history ruins you.
                               Every fallen leaf is your self-portrait where promises are made
             on yellow suicide notes, petal-soft when palmed, but we’re left with our hands
scattered between blurred centuries. Every evening is another chance
       to be gorgeous. To be human. But is it enough to be beautiful & never once
ask for forgiveness? What am I even saying? I’m saying
                     God forgets you & every lover you leave behind. This is the story we were
                                           given & so we make a maze out of each museum we pass by
& enter the gallery of our bones. This is the painting we step out of. The walls
                                                      we bury ourselves behind, hand-shoveling ourselves in
                until we taste the kissable dirt of a nation that has no choice
                                      but to nation us. The horses in our hometowns gallop headlong
into the backyards of crushed apples. The cities we built along the inner walls
                                                                     of our skin were never there—& here we are
planning the end of our lives. The aspen tree making a forest
      of its shade. Our Father Who Art in Heaven tossing bodies donning your face into my
dreams like bundled newspapers landing in morning mailboxes. Remains Found in an Unplugged
                               Freezer by Two Homeless Men is when they all refuse
             to witness human shadows & panic that countrywide American panic. Here we are
                                                    again at the gates of someone’s kingdom. You are a classified
homicide but they will call your body urgent & emerging. The wind also rises
                             to make the story interesting. To make His call to serve
     ever more divine. Remember how the morning will arrive. Just like every evening & those
                                                                                                         beautiful, lord-
laid leaves in the yard. Our memory rewinds the sky to see that rare, mid-autumn snow
                  reappear in the dark & lift back to the want left amid the stars. This is what happens
             to the boy who appears in your dream—like the shepherd,
                               lamb-like, he is back home with a shining black barrel in his mouth
as if to carve the name
                           of this country to the back of his throat. At last,
                  give him the title he earned: ’ácqa, or him’pe’ewyíin just to say he will survive
                               this episode unraveling into history repeats itself, so lie back down in the field
       broken by the names you forget over & over while the ghosts lift through you
& leave behind the trace of a snow angel lying facedown in its casket of night. Every evening
                        is this: the everlasting image of Him that you tear apart into confetti. Here
                                                 are your rights: your body with its limbs crossed out. Here are
       all the usual & accustomed places that claim you can return to lullaby our ghosts farewell
                  but fail to say who they are. Their glottals & uvular plosives that change táxc, táqc 
                               from táxs & t’áx. They will tell you a country isn’t a country until
it's written in a language only the living can pronounce. Handless prayers. Deliver me
          from the touch of a territory I have no real name for
                                                 but hawáawa because every story I want to tell
begins & ends with blood & us reaching for each other. They will say
                                                                                                     everything you are meant to
                                          understand. That your bones, our bones, His bones, glitter brightest
in the earliest seconds of daybreak. Rain. Here it is again—forgive me. The rain
                   of their Father Almighty, hear it speaking through
                                                              flesh & pinning you against the land. The bombs are
bursting in air this evening. Look how lovely this all is. History
                                          ruins your jaw for the next star-spangled life with a contract
     & enough ink for a single signature. Here’s your family in the register—all newer names
                       with newer terrors that leave them fleeing through the polished windows
            of America. You open the last window wide enough
to let me through. In one dream, I am making dinner for you—your favorite:
                                            stew & bread, but is joy enough to help us survive another night
like tonight? Another dream,
                        I’m talking to you like you
are really here. In your boyish, still-breathing voice. Your hand reaching up & out
                                                                                                                 of my throat as if
                              you climbed my ribs to escape drowning inside me. Last night,
we opened our eyes together, face-to-face, & saw only deer
                                                 leaping out of sight. Your footsteps smaller with each
passing season. The world crosses us
                                       out. Tomorrow, I will find you trapped underwater. I open my eyes &
                   I am right before you & we breathe like uncaught fish. But I wake
& wake & wake & that decade is already a bedroom clock behind me because
                               this evening is always today. The monster claims you—you swallow a god-
awful century of light & we are in slow-
              motion again in that October panorama—running to you
                                                                                            with all your life, in chokecherry red,
       bone-white, & that beautiful unbreakable blue, ’ilcwéew’cix a shard blossoming in the dark
of your skull like language measuring the worth of our
            lives—like your final Fourth of July. I’m as human as you made me
                                                      to be. Tonight, don’t I look as beautiful as you do
                         when dressed in every skinned animal gone missing
to translation? I lie down in bed to mimic you, dead & almost forever. tóota’, don’t I look
                   just gorgeous enough to devour?

the earth we mouthed it wound our vowels until
it fit, in fits the earth we mounted roused
& rocked we harped we yawned & tried to yawp
& tried to fix, affixed, we facted, felt.
we fattened fanfared anthemed hammered, felt
the words’ worth stagnate, snap in half in heat

after nameless meadow, I hear tekín’me c’íxc’ix  clearing away the remains of
    a summer’s harvest— 
___ 
a life: the fruiting shadow of a bitterroot seared to earth by your god mouthing
    líw líw— 
___ 
-’ce: the history of our bodies is proven wrong in the flicker of an eyelid— 
___ 
Holding steady, my fingerprints stain like cracks— 
___ 
like the briefest coffins opening their lids, revealing only— 
___ 
eyes that want nothing but the day- 
___ 
light now rimming around each shut door in the house— 
___ 
But here’s the poem again, my beloved: the poem will end, I promise, & life
    will—
___ 
go back to how it always was: before you— 
___ 
ever looked in the mirror & forgot me breathing behind its melting tile of
    winter— 
___ 
Look. The kitchen table is ready for you— 
___ 
Your son is in position— 
___ 
to smile as wide as the tire swing he lifts his legs up from to gather & thrust
    to the air— 
___ 
She leaps into the amber of an afternoon gashed with breathing holes— 
___ 
What, Lord, am I doing bearing the back of a mirror no one asked for? 
___ 
Tell me anything, like— 
___  hitxlic’áasa ’ee & these scraps of flame are landing on you, scattering over— 
___ 
you, exploding— 
___ 
Is this the sound of failure, the very beginning, or the faintest celebration
    of  forever? 
___ 
Say láatis. pipísnim c’íxc’ix. Say yoqóx like a distant spring in another
    version of this nation. Listen— 
___ 
Hear my fingerprints dissolve— 
___ 
into the unspeakable names of animals stampeding until— 
___ 
they vanish, until they are looking for you— 
___ 
God, I promised this poem would end— 
___ 
God, I’m only human enough to swallow what your season must offer— 
___ 
You walk toward me, the entrance wound between us still fresh as a welcome— 
___ 
but I am no longer there.

Walking through a cathedral of oak trees
and bristlecone pines, scolded by squirrels
in their priestly black, their white collars
wagging with the force of their scolding, I
was struck, simultaneously, in both eyes,
by some sort of flying detritus—pollen or seeds—
and stopped to lean against a rock
to scrub it (I thought) away. It was May, 
it was May, it was May, and the air was sweet
with pine and Island Mountain lilac. The squirrels,
I mentioned them already, etc, and the lizards
ran down the spines of rocks like a bad feeling. I
could see everything: red-headed hummingbirds
dipped their beaks into the little red hoods of penstemon,
and I, a redhead, could hear everything: a red-crested
woodpecker, who was not offended I did not know his name. 
And I could see everything: it was all green, really;
even the red was anti-green, and though my eyes
ached from everything-seeing, I could taste the granite
in the spring (oh yes, I drank water from the ground; I
was wild, even then, though the squirrels scolded
me and tried to convince me I was not). Soon I crested
a rise; the land spread itself greenly for me and I
wished I had seed to toss into that green, just to see 
what would root. My right eye would not close to this
view; why would it; but when I reached up to touch it, I
felt that there was a twig emerging, and another from my
other eye; that they were a part of my body I could not doubt;
they were living and enervated and jutting out. I
sat down, feeling the hairs on the back of my neck,
understanding for the first time they were not hairs, but roots.
I could see everything; it was all green; the twigs in my eyes 
tasted sunlight with my mouth; the roots drew the salt
from my sweat into their vacuum, and I was no longer hungry:
my metamorphosis had rendered me perfectly self-sufficient. I
could see everything; the roots in my skull shifted and I
lay down beneath my own branches. I had to wiggle a bit to
find a place to lay my head; the rock was very hard,
and I needed softer ground—yes, a place for the top
of my head to come off, to nuzzle into the earth, to drink.

For Phillip and for Marwa 
Featuring Robert Frost, William Cullen Bryant, and Alice Notley



Now darkness was not upon but was
the deep’s complete face 
and then was roof on the valley that
that which is not valley knocks. 
In darkness, mine was not a linear condition.
Mine was the express mission of uncountable spirits 
reaching in ceaselessly to relink their fingers.
I was architected like a multidimensional radial hemorrhage. 
I dilated on all axes like a dahlia
and was a field of this. 
And then fell the fallacy that the dirt
I worked and from which I ate 
and into which I was delivered
to be devoured could not possibly 
vibrate the notes of my brute living;
so spoke the beast out of the void 
in its god costume. In its compass
there was hematite. In my ears 
the blood murmured.
The protracted aftermath 
expanded as the universe expands—
from all coordinates, from the atomic core. 
Among what I abandoned: the belief
that there would ever again be 
postwar poetry, or a poet born other
-wise than in the time of war, or an alibi 
for where I was if not brutally living
in and off of war. I was impelled 
to create in an era of adept destruction.
I had to begin by deconstructing 
my creation. I saw the waiting peaks.
I knew what the snow was: overblown, 
footloose, excessive, feckless,
not white but a predilection for reflecting 
—absolutely—all light,
obsessed with possessing spectrum 
but impervious to access, and pitifully janused;
occupation was its solitary ache. 
I was a poet then. I lamented the lyric’s
optimism for a sympathetic ear. 
I tried to puzzle the ear, to jigsaw apart
for the snow the sound of snow, its one tenor 
of wind and its monuments to static—
but the ear merely clotted its wax. 
Darkness dampened there in the valley bottom.
I had to maculate the gleam in my eye. 
On either slope, sheer and utter eroded under
meters of endless nonce determined to condense 
a form even blue giants must derive from
but cut it out. I cut a cut of ear and ate of my form 
which was not mine but a fashion called humanity.
The poem’s pursuit was apparently to humanize 
and the poet’s to petition this universal experience.
I saw the universe. It was black and unbothered. 
I smudged the blue from the snow
and the blues from my beautiful jaw, 
their need to coax a cheek left to turn.
                             Cut it out. 
Eventide was over. I had chosen
lunar glamour’s ruptured pantoum 
as occasion to observe the world
sleeping in the dust of its birth. 
Its angsts and clattered growths combing
the trillion distant distant happenings 
that spilled into this bone-quiet basin in unison
hummed. One tongue slid along another. 
The glimpse of galaxy between the rocky shelves
was the scintilla of a velvet pocket pleasuring itself. 
I came to place my voyeurism under black gaze. 
How could I stand the pastoral, standing
on stolen land, propped like a rifle? 
The idyll was a metropole of violence. Verses from
the vantage point of frost were purely blank, not free. 
Suddenly the valley was disaster, every chasm
unconsenting. I could not recover a peace to rest in. 
When I was delivered into the dirt from which I ate
I did not lie down with kings nor wise nor good of ages past. 
I went down like the quarry-slave at night
and got up like the quarry-slave at night 
and, curved as the birch a boy swings,
raided the patriarchs’ rooms for tongues 
to put in my head, which was all jaw and beautiful.
When I was the snake I spake in subterfuge. 
I rolled out the higher register. It had a trapdoor.
I lined the stanzas of sestinas in trip wire and slippage 
but lying fanged on the break
and in the envoi bore no fruit: 
I was “a black” “snake. I had” “black sibilance.”
“I was” “built” “like a loco” “motive of” “blackackackackack.” 
As long as I shed a legible treasure trail of sufferings
my camouflaged linear contortions were of no concern. 
I returned to the valley on my belly, earless,
darkness divining the paper-slit chutes of my pupils 
on its way to stake me in the ground.
I coiled around it, asclepic. Ill with trusting 
nothing—neither what I had inherited nor
what I had imposed—I inhaled my tail 
and devolved into a helix of volta, a Möbius
beast, holding my inertia by the throat. 
It was easy to see from there how madness
could afflict the unwitting witnesses of jazz. 
What could pause emptily in the core
of this pressing omnipresence and resist 
and not be pulverized? Once,
when I was human, I hovered 
my pinhead eardrum within tipping range
of a speaker the breadth of two silverback gorillas 
and have listened to the will-less
rustle of dead leaves ever since. 
I felt it getting in, frenzied as the tremolo
sinuating Coltrane Quartet’s “Inch Worm.” 
So receptive was this life and that
of a mite on the back of a rat in an alley 
while the planet barreled down
its cosmic corridor, its futured birth canal 
—though because theirs simply were not
I had thought mine could not be. 
I hissed. I lifted the lock in the neck
to speak the name of my only in and of, 
to be named myself: 
low highness of sky,
wholly night, 
palette Polydectes,
have-it-all, 
Black. 
Here was the form: a preponderance
of intersecting improvisation, in each 
bereft moment a bequest, every shovel
in my back a new spade head. 
I had slithered hungrily after the end of me
to learn that all I’m made of is beginnings. 
I am the hydra of  I
and soon I will be the next thing. 
I was bred in an animal condition.
I am criminal by nation. 
I come rabidly available to cannibalize 
the traditions of the kings and the wise and good
citizens. Asylum never rested in the lyric. 
It is midnight in the bottom and the winter
is an embolism. Coverlets of frigid civility. 
I carry the seeds in my beautiful jaws
for the milkweed of malcontent. 
There will be no lily here, only venom. 
I will sow the music.
Its trumpets, they will ramify. 
When I arrive I will be always arriving.

forgive my geography, it’s true i’m obsessed
with maps. with flags. a Starbucks on the block
means migration. any restaurant with bulletproof glass
is a homecoming. underneath my gym shoes
is a trail of salt. that last sentence is a test.
does the poet mean:
(a) grief
(b) winter
(c) diaspora
(d) this is the wrong question
(e) all of the above
i’m always out south
of somewhere. i know the sun rises
in Lake Michigan and sets out west.
i got primos i’ve never met. there’s a word
for that. (where did they go?) all the steel mills shuttering up
like conquered forts. one day, there will be an urban tour
through South Chicago. picture the soy cappuccino-
sipping cool kids wearing Chicago Over Everything-
branded hoodies taking selfies in front of machines
that once breathed fire. pretending the bones
are the real thing.

                    Before the apocalypse, there was the apocalypse of boats:
boats of prisoners, boats cracking under sky-iron, boats making corpses
bloom like algae on the shore. Before the apocalypse, there was the apocalypse
of the bombed mosque. There was the apocalypse of the taxi driver warped
by flame. There was the apocalypse of the leaving, and the having left—
of my mother unsticking herself from her mother’s grave as the plane
barreled down the runway. Before the apocalypse, there was the apocalypse
of planes. There was the apocalypse of pipelines legislating their way
through sacred water, and the apocalypse of the dogs. Before which was
the apocalypse of the dogs and the hoses. Before which, the apocalypse
of dogs and slave catchers whose faces glowed by lantern-light.
Before the apocalypse, the apocalypse of bees. The apocalypse of  buses.
Border fence apocalypse. Coat hanger apocalypse. Apocalypse in
the textbooks’ selective silences. There was the apocalypse of the settlement
and the soda machine; the apocalypse of the settlement and
the jars of scalps; there was the bedlam of the cannery; the radioactive rain;
the chairless martyr demanding a name. I was born from an apocalypse
and have come to tell you what I know—which is that the apocalypse began
when Columbus praised God and lowered his anchor. It began when a continent
was drawn into cutlets. It began when Kublai Khan told Marco, Begin
at the beginning. By the time the apocalypse began, the world had already
ended. It ended every day for a century or two. It ended, and another ending
world spun in its place. It ended, and we woke up and ordered Greek coffees,
drew the hot liquid through our teeth, as everywhere, the apocalypse rumbled,
the apocalypse remembered, our dear, beloved apocalypse—it drifted
slowly from the trees all around us, so loud we stopped hearing it.

Some days you wake to the sound of smoke pouring through
the keyhole in the room. Open your eyes. This is only a test. The bluing of 
your hands can be anything you want. The bruised dawn
like a river rising to your windowsill. A purple forgetting how blood leaves 
the body in ruin. A forsaken lip smeared in thirst resting on your lip
as though your skin could salvage the dream of being 
so touched. Listen. I know you’re afraid—I am too. I know how the body
   prays
for beauty but remains a shipwreck you are building in my image. How
   many 
books are enough to tell you you’re alive today? How many days end
up all dark & the monsters of your childhood appear like saints erased 
of their mouths? How the mouth cradles a tongue carved by years
in exile until it’s ready to shape a word like a parting hand- 
ful of promised wildflowers: Happy Mother’s Day. This is you
at the edge of a paradise growing back after being scorched from the face 
of earth. This is us afraid of the men who fail to kiss us goodnight & step
   through
the walls. Some days you are living a nightmare. Some days a miracle as
   wide 
as a spared life. Listen to me. There will be a day when the world will need
   you
most—be alive on that day. I vow your father is as American as 
the bones your mother grew inside you. The gunshot
in your head is only a shadow puppet, a slow explosion of a field 
of qém’es in early June’s bloom. Look. Look at the colors like little gods
on fire—hurdling in & out of each other’s terrified skies. Are you still alone 
in bed? Is it morning yet where you are? The smoke turns
to rain as usual. Listen, my love. This year is just a visitor & next year’s 
ghost. Take care of it because yes—yes, you do deserve flowers for once
in your life. You will be the only one left. So hold my hand & call me  tomorrow. We are all here. It’s okay—it’s okay to be this
afraid. I am you. Can you feel that? Yes, that is the whole world outside 
moving without us. But listen to me. Listen. Here’s the light
an arm’s length away. The ceiling reforming 
above you, like another heaven after its own self-
destruction. Here’s my body & you stretching lifelong 
toward every hole in the house
left as warm as a father running from 
horizon to horizon. Don’t be afraid. Touch me here
where, some days, it hurts. Get up, get dressed, 
open the door.

The children of fugitives perhaps lust for nothing
so much as a country where we are faster
than everything else. Here I graceless bouquet
of dark whipping hard through a need
for electric. No one wants to be the negro swan,
the song like all songs    the surrogate
of a man. Above estate upon estate
of storm clouds, to the sides pine
and green and implication. Road
of isolated light, always a storm is possible, always
what I need to know the property of another
dark. No one wants to be the swan who cracks
the quiet, I have been waiting though, I think
all my life to siren like this     tonight
I sound to strike down the tether.
Crowned by elegy, crowned by escape; I am
so tired of ruling my sorrow this way. But
I am practiced, I father the bass
until each branch knows its sovereign
is less of a country than of a sound.
I am coming, toward something
I cannot name but still own. O, Mississippi;
bloodsong again has me singing you
past the curfew of the once-owned. Trust me,
not even the heat can save you now.
When I move like this I am certain nothing
for miles can touch me      I have never let a man
touch me.   Yet I live     in the fact of  touch.
I’m swerving   in the anthem   I play
when I am willing my lone exit into a palace
of doors.       I mean to stain everything
when the war comes. I intend to die
with a blade through every hunger.    What violences
me here, names the tether after love. What wants me
dead can’t decide which me to kill first. I learned
from the soft of the kudzu how to swallow the enemy
and call the color landscape. Let the lyric fool you,
dearest enemy      I kill best to the slow songs.

We plant seeds in the ground
And dreams in the sky,
 
Hoping that, someday, the roots of one
Will meet the upstretched limbs of the other.
 
It has not happened yet.
We share the sky, all of us, the whole world:
 
Together, we are a tribe of eyes that look upward,
Even as we stand on uncertain ground.
 
The earth beneath us moves, quiet and wild,
Its boundaries shifting, its muscles wavering.
 
The dream of sky is indifferent to all this,
Impervious to borders, fences, reservations.
 
The sky is our common home, the place we all live.
There we are in the world together.
 
The dream of sky requires no passport.
Blue will not be fenced. Blue will not be a crime.
 
Look up. Stay awhile. Let your breathing slow.
Know that you always have a home here.


^^EOP^^


Christmas Eves our dad would bring
Home from the farm real hay
For the reindeer that didn't exist
And after we were finally asleep
Would get out and take the slabs
Up in his arms and carry them
Back to the bed of his pickup,
Making sure to litter the snow
With chaff so he could show us
In the morning the place where
They'd stood eating, their harness
Bells dulled by the cold, their breath
Steam, all while we were dreaming.


^^EOP^^


you fit into me
like a hook into an eye 
a fish hook
an open eye

I'm the first car after the sander.
The cinnamon swirls of fresh sand are intact.
 
Except for that—the sand and the road—
 
The woods look as if they might have
a thousand years ago, except for
 
the absence of tracks.


^^EOP^^


Here you are forty years
later in a white coat
examining my ears.
 
All I can think
is how your tongue once
turned in the tunnel
 
you're peering into.  The
fault is not in my ears,
but between them!
 
No one can see that far.
But could we gaze back
through the years and dead stars
 
to the doorstep of my parents' house,
you bending down with your tall mouth
to make the softest landing on mine,
 
having thrown off my balance
so tenderly, can you explain,
good Doctor, how to regain it?

I saw this day coming         class would end       and it would be night
            time to attach         bike lights               tonight I lit my way
with a cigarette                   
                    I asked if petticoat ding a ling         was a fun bar
NO it’s a line from Clairvoyant Journal               YOU GUYS WANT

and I’m thrown into turmoil         I like parties
that I’m not invited to    best     lack of riposte similar to when Madeline

it would be the one on campus
with rhizomatic eyeball

I ALONE
am responsible for the content and decorum         of my PERSON
O well-ordered ulcer we live in
collectively pointing to a number
                                                                           on a pain chart

the smell of burning leaves      tonight and their presence         in the bird bath
           reminds me of New Berlin    where 2 old people instilled a work ethic
                        by connecting neat crayons and fear of a mouthful of soap
 
perpetuum mirum why would anyone                         WANT          
                                                                                    to hurt me???
I was at a perfect party      
            no you cannot give edibles         to everyone     where I smoked

                          with beads of red wine                 in his beard

                    I thought a tree dying was a sign of pestilence or terror or you’d done something wrong in your life and so your tree died. But no, sometimes, like a pet, they just go. Lifespan different than a dog, how unfair is that, you just get your dog for only this little finger of time and then move on. Whose pets are we? If the lifespan of a tree is significantly longer than ours, does that make us its pet? Like in the concentric circle of lifespans, who wins that contest and is that how you decided to make god a thing? Who am I asking all these questions of, my mother? I am the mother now and have to come up with answers like the way one letter from the word “now” to “not” changes everything: your breakfast is now ready, your breakfast is not ready. Why don’t we speak typos. At the level of the letter. It’s when I saw my hand holding the baby’s head I realized I wasn’t the baby anymore.

The river was deep & wide. 
                                           Wild girls grew along 
the riverbanks. Wild strawberries grew 
          among the wet grass. A girl tramped barefoot. 
Her tips arrowed. The tracks wept 
                                           in the distance. She scavenged 
            wild strawberries. The river water stung her mouth. 
The water turned her skin sky. Alone 
                                                              the girl knelt to sift water 
           through her fingers. There was once a dock 
                                                              with a wooden boat. Once a general. 
                                           Once a sister. Once a mother who hid 
behind the general. Once a machete. 
                                           Once a girl who swallowed the salt. 
She held the resonance of chromatic 
                                           harmony. The quiet of faded mist. 
The lines of riverbank made everything still. 
                    The girl understood the river’s undying blue. 
The river of uncut red flowers. The river 
                                                             flooded & 
                              drowned. Once a sodden hummingbird. 
Once a lone foal. The girl was not allowed 
                                         to speak Spanish. The girl wore a garland 
of speech. She found she was only half 
                                         of everything. Half of her mother. 
The general took her downriver. 
                                                    Scavenging. 
                                         The wild strawberries. It was spring. 
                               The strawberries were held below ice. 
It was winter. The general commanded 
                               her to lie down. The pain 
was a thud of a knife & boot blade 
                                         deep in the hull of her hips. 
The girl left her body. Her spirit rose. 
                                                    She herself  became the crumpled shape 
of a saturated bow. The river 
                              created a halo of sound. 
                                        She still held a strawberry in her hand. 
She looked like a perfect crumpled bow. 
                              She was lying on the ground. 
She thought she was lying on the sky. 
                              The quiet of the faded mist. 
                                                        The lines of riverbank made everything kill. 
                    The girl wanted to escape the undying blue. 
The girl was only half of her mother. The girl was 
                                          strong against tide. The girl learned
                                           
                     to forget. The girl was nothing but water. 
                                                               She lay on the sky.

Not books, but
a street opened my mouth like a doctor’s spatula.
One by one, streets introduced themselves
with the names of national
murderers.
In the State Archives, covers
hardened like scabs
over the ledgers. 
Inside a tiny apartment
I built myself
                     into a separate room,
peopled it
                           with the Calibans
of plans for the future. 
Future that runs on the schedule of public buses,
         from the zoo to the circus, what future;
what is your alibi for these ledgers, these streets, this apartment, this future? 
In the purse which held—
          through seven wars—
                     the birth certificates
of the dead, my grandmother
hid—from me—
chocolates. The purse opened like a screaming mouth.
Its two shiny buckles watched me
through doors, through walls, through jazz. 
Who has taught you to be a frightening face, purse?
I kiss your buckles, I swear myself your subject. 
August. Apples. I have nobody.
August. For me, a ripe apple is a little brother. 
For me, a four-legged table is a pet. 
In the temple of Supermarket
I stand
like a candle 
in the line to the priestesses who preserve
the knowledge of sausage prices, the virginity
of milk cartons. My future, small
change after buying necessities. 
Future that runs on the schedule of public buses,
streets introduced themselves with the names
of national murderers. I build myself
into a separate room, where memory—
the illegal migrant in time—cleans up
after imagination. 
In a room where memory strips the beds—
linens that hardened like scabs
on the mattresses—I kiss 
little apples—my brothers—I kiss the buckles
that watch us through walls, through years, through jazz;
chocolates from a purse that held—through seven wars—
birth certificates of the dead! 
Hold me, brother-apple.

But then four crows—no, maybe ravens—those large, black birds big as dogs, 
like gentlemen, crossed the path, looking up, contemplating something invisible, 
feathers on their crowns at attention, as if waxed into style, sun polishing each upright stalk, 
asphalt, grass visible between each black spear, the way, when younger, we spiked 
our hair before dancing all night at an after-hours club, but I don’t know
what it means now: Rocking gait: slow procession: pondering a shared question— 
unseen force drawing them across the road or a predator overhead
or walking away from despair hidden in the heart. She looks 
to be holding a miniature man in her lap, the Mary of Kells. He has
two left feet. And she stares, her face a mask of sorrow, eyes flattened, looking ahead. 
The messengers hover. They want to bear her away. They want to sing hosannas.
But they are cramped inside the box of the possible, heads bent sideways, thinking 
of what it means to think. They want to take responsibility. They want
to turn the tide. But they barely fit around her. 
When the angel came, Mary was sitting in time untimely. She was sitting, a creature
uncreaturely. She was sitting in the body maidenly. Her soul was deiform.

Cold sunlight tracked me down the moving sidewalk, the city busy with its market routine. It must have been a Saturday in March, the faraway towers gleaming. I was crossing the street of a refugee dream when someone spotted Angela Merkel. Hey look, they said. And a crowd formed around her. She was sweetly obliging. I reached out first to pat her on the back. Nice job, I said. Keep up the good work. Then I couldn’t get the camera on my phone to open. The screen was frozen, the filter slow to load. Around me people took their selfies and dispersed. Angela began to walk away, so I followed at a polite distance, trying to think of a question to ask her, something about her step-grandchildren or the future of democracy, all the while fiddling with my phone. A couple of blocks and she reached her doorstep, was about to slip inside a flower-trimmed townhouse when finally I managed to open the lens. I held out my arm and stood on the brick stairs below her, the tall stout figure of Angela Merkel. She leaned down to get inside the frame. She smiled sweetly. An informal clique gathered to watch Angela Merkel put her arm around my shoulder when someone in this sudden faction shot me with a water pistol. I laughed, but that laugh masked outrage that Chancellor Merkel might get splashed in the doorway of her very own house. And then without a word she slipped inside. The door clicked shut, and I started down the stairs, exceedingly pleased that I had met Angela Merkel. Someone else looming and vigilant patted me on the back. Let’s see, they said. I thumbed through the photos but there were only a few blurry shots of crossbars on windows and crows on streetlights. There was one of me on the brick stoop, gritting my teeth, biting back a laugh, my face wet with tears. But no Angela Merkel. She was nowhere to be seen. The crowd turned away, a slow murmur trailing down the street dissolving into ordinary traffic. Alone, I shuffled glumly toward my hotel. Oh Angela, where have you gone? On whose doorstep will we build our welcome now?

She looks at your papers.
She asks your husband to step out.
She asks you where your husband’s birthplace is.
She is testing you. You answer:            we were made in water in free-flowing 
          salt water rich with plankton 
          & we keep a fire 
          in our lungs it burns white 
          red in the center like a hibiscus 
          you must know we are all manic 
          you must know we are not ink

You pick me up late
a viscous outflow 
from the volcanic ledge
of my thinking. 
Me in my duplex-hunger,
in my firestorm-astonished 
dress, the pattern of crisp asphalt,
the pattern, simple condensed 
nuclei, against my dry
lightning ache. You pick me up late 
and we drive through
polyhedronated structures 
of sound and civics-minded lives,
lives bearing fruit with no regard 
for the termination-tables
recently made, vast ledgers 
of waste, of debits,
of human trees.  Debris is my name I say
as we drive past 
the decibels, the altostratusly
hung steeples, debris is 
my name

A phantom

said one tremendous
wave to the next tre-

came from thousands
of miles away, and
the first raised its voice,
as the second lowered
its voice and so on
and so forth and the waves
had a long conversation
with each other, talked
of what they had lost,
“Have you left anything
in the world you
didn’t wash away
by flood?” asked
the first wave.
“I have been burned
by the vapor
of many stars,” replied
the second. “It is
a sort of sensory
deprivation they
suffer from,” said
the first wave
and then the two waves
softly decayed
on the stretched
beach and they
could tell from the smell
of the sand
in the desert
that it is was spring 
the way sound
fluctuates almost
indefinitely
and they felt
the two sides of
water wrap
around the birds
and they could hear
the oranges
ripening on the trees
more inland
and the gentle
frenzy of bees
and the little
girl walking
toward a mirage,
passing the mirage
into real water
and they could
reach very far
into her little
iris and could
see the entire
ocean in the
background
which was the birthplace
of waves, the little
girl and the story,
a generative
repetition as
the little girl
picked the fruit
and ate it quietly
by herself.

He told the story of
a hang glider who lost
his arm in 1998
not flying but
rather hopping
freights full
of cattle, trains tremb-
ling with agitated
meat that would
not accept the adverse
conditions of their
demise, would not
accept their direction
of travel and when
the man returned home
several months later
to his northern town
of aurora borealis,
huckleberries,
and hang gliders,
all his hang glider
friends had died due
to the defective
wings the company
manufactured,
so we can see
this irony as mythos
on the fringe
of wind, that they
died in the latent
tower’s downdraft,
in the deep cyclonic
ice, in the super-
cooled remnants where
there remains a dense,
vigorous orb, an
iridescence, a cadence
that wraps the flagrant
urge eclipsed
by bites, a spectrum
of trauma-in-
duced reckoning.
Where was
the man’s arm?
He knocked on a hex-
agonal pat-
tern, I mean
he knocked on the door
of what falters,
I mean he knocked
on the door of the poly-
phonic, on what
cannot resonate or est-
ablish itself
in one eloquence,
their mouths, ears,
eyes full of graupel
and graupel on
their tongues as a
charm, as language
spiraling through
waves, fire, centuries
toward earth, turning
round and around
as mechanism, as
phenomenon, how
lucky I am thinks
the man, I would like
an omelet and coffee
thinks the man who
is now content to fade
unlike the others’
manifold omen, a lull
so turbulent—
I fold in
I fold in.

Ok, I’m gonna go ahead and ask ... have ya’ll ever seen floaters this clean. I’m
not trying to be an a$$ but I HAVE NEVER SEEN FLOATERS LIKE THIS,
could this be another edited photo. We’ve all seen the dems and liberal parties
do some pretty sick things.
—Anonymous post, “I’m 10-15” Border Patrol Facebook group



Like a beer bottle thrown into the river by a boy too drunk to cry,
like the shard of a Styrofoam cup drained of coffee brown as the river,
like the plank of a fishing boat broken in half by the river, the dead float.
And the dead have a name: floaters, say the men of the Border Patrol,
keeping watch all night by the river, hearts pumping coffee as they say
the word floaters, soft as a bubble, hard as a shoe as it nudges the body,
to see if it breathes, to see if it moans, to see if it sits up and speaks. 
And the dead have names, a feast day parade of names, names that
dress all in red, names that twirl skirts, names that blow whistles,
names that shake rattles, names that sing in praise of the saints:
Say Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez. Say Angie Valeria Martínez Ávalos.
See how they rise off the tongue, the calling of bird to bird somewhere
in the trees above our heads, trilling in the dark heart of the leaves. 
Say what we know of them now they are dead: Óscar slapped dough
for pizza with oven-blistered fingers. Daughter Valeria sang, banging
a toy guitar. He slipped free of the apron he wore in the blast of the oven,
sold the motorcycle he would kick till it sputtered to life, counted off
pesos for the journey across the river, and the last of his twenty-five
years, and the last of her twenty-three months. There is another name
that beats its wings in the heart of the trees: Say Tania Vanessa Ávalos,
Óscar’s wife and Valeria’s mother, the witness stumbling along the river. 
Now their names rise off her tongue: Say Óscar y Valeria. He swam
from Matamoros across to Brownsville, the girl slung around his neck,
stood her in the weeds on the Texas side of the river, swore to return
with her mother in hand, turning his back as fathers do who later say: I turned around and she was gone. In the time it takes for a bird to hop
from branch to branch, Valeria jumped in the river after her father.
Maybe he called out her name as he swept her up from the river;
maybe the river drowned out his voice as the water swept them away.
Tania called out the names of the saints, but the saints drowsed
in the stupor of birds in the dark, their cages covered with blankets.
The men on patrol would never hear their pleas for asylum, watching
for floaters, hearts pumping coffee all night on the Texas side of the river. 
No one, they say, had ever seen floaters so clean: Óscar’s black shirt
yanked up to the armpits, Valeria’s arm slung around her father’s
neck even after the light left her eyes, both face down in the weeds,
back on the Mexican side of the river. Another edited photo: See how
her head disappears in his shirt, the waterlogged diaper bunched
in her pants, the blue of the blue cans. The radio warned us about
the crisis actors we see at one school shooting after another; the man
called Óscar will breathe, sit up, speak, tug the black shirt over
his head, shower off the mud and shake hands with the photographer. 
Yet, the floaters did not float down the Río Grande like Olympians
showing off the backstroke, nor did their souls float up to Dallas,
land of rumored jobs and a president shot in the head as he waved
from his motorcade. No bubbles rose from their breath in the mud,
light as the iridescent circles of soap that would fascinate a two-year-old. 
And the dead still have names, names that sing in praise of the saints,
names that flower in blossoms of white, a cortege of names dressed
all in black, trailing the coffins to the cemetery. Carve their names
in headlines and gravestones they would never know in the kitchens
of this cacophonous world. Enter their names in the book of names.
Say Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez; say Angie Valeria Martínez Ávalos.
Bury them in a corner of the cemetery named for the sainted archbishop
of the poor, shot in the heart saying mass, bullets bought by the taxes
I paid when I worked as a bouncer and fractured my hand forty years
ago, and bumper stickers read: El Salvador Is Spanish for Vietnam. 
When the last bubble of breath escapes the body, may the men
who speak of floaters, who have never seen floaters this clean,
float through the clouds to the heavens, where they paddle the air
as they wait for the saint who flips through the keys on his ring
like a drowsy janitor, till he fingers the key that turns the lock and shuts
the gate on their babble-tongued faces, and they plunge back to earth,
a shower of hailstones pelting the river, the Mexican side of the river.

Wasn’t it the hidden folk
lived under the barn
that summer when
no one left them
their porridge and sweets
as they were wont to do
when everyone was in
good health and the cows
all sound and giving milk
but no one had asked
the hidden ones’ permission
to use their meadow
when the new folks
moved in and didn’t she say
it was the hidden man so handsome
and dressed better than any of us
with our poor sheepskin shoes
who seduced our daughter
when we were away
and then gave her a son 
And wasn’t it when the boy
whose own father teased him
and called him weak and ergi
who was left alone to watch the sheep
when he disappeared
for many years only to reappear
at his father’s deathbed
dressed in fine clothes
embroidered with gold
to claim his inheritance 
And wasn’t it on Christmas eve
as dark and foggy as it was
when we all went
to the Christian church
that the hidden ones
started a fire that burned the barn
and that same night
when riding home
our brother and neighbor
fell and was lost in a deep crevice
hidden by the snow
as dark and foggy as it was

It was summer in Hokkaido.
           The forest stole the wind
           and I swallowed my footsteps.
           Nobody came to the springs.
           Butt naked I sat halfway
           through my life measuring
           this, that.
In Hokkaido it was summer.
           Everything was halved or merged.
           Half-cut fingers, half-foxgloves,
           a marrowbone-cum-cabbage white.
           The daylight moon, split.
           I talked to nobody about
           this, that.
Hokkaido in summer it was.
           Ants were carrying a caterpillar
           home. No bird arguing.
           Nobody said missiles crossing
           so I stayed. The night trees
           stole the seas, canceling
           this, that.

At the front of the room I look out at the faces
The light is fluorescent, the faces are lit
The windows in the back of the room are dark
My mouth makes sounds like “ughh” and “thh” and “and”
My tongue shapes to the inside of my mouth and I am aware of it
At the front of the room I’m taller
I stand while others are seated
They look at me while I open my mouth, expectant, as if I will show them something
They ask a question:
The darkness comes in from outside
It seeps though the crack in the door
They ask a question
What it is about:
Behind me the white board feels uncertain, I can cover or uncover
Mosiac, I spell, “mosaic,” they say
I do not erase and replace
My mouth gets hot and makes a sound like “mo,” like “say,” like “this is where you might
second-guess yourself”
We all can hear metal being wiped in the restroom beyond the wall
We all know the cart outside waits for us to finish
They turn to the page or turn to the screen and write
I stand and write and I am aware of looking them over
My tongue folds to the edge of my mouth

It’s gone thirty years since this light steel disc
                                   warmed to his skin,
sixty and more since I laid my child’s ear
                                   closer to hear
what I could not read (for who goes there?
                                   to Babylon, hourly):
my play-time shortened by the whisper of a tick,
                                   its sprung mechanism,
light-tongued creature, touch-ing, touch-ing
                                   (so whose time is it?)
his wrist’s pale skin, my wondering ear,
                                   and I praying
for more time to play, as the calculating thing
                                   dialed the sunshine’s
livelong light and stole my day
                                   with three thin hands—
nothing like hands, but insect feelers
                                   that rounded up
my first garden’s early dream-time,
                                   snaffled away. 
Then, it was only play-time I’d save
                                   from the scuff of  its count,
its too smooth run of minutes, hours,
                                   its winning way;
now, finding it silent in a drawer,
                                   I bend my ear
and wind the tiny tractor wheel
                                   to hear it still touch-ing, touch-ing, after thirty years,
                                   his wasted wrist
raced to its ending, and the child’s child-wish,
                                   long vanished, dismissed,
to stay in a garden as light diminished.
                                   I strap its cold
close on my wrist-bone, the leather-worn eyelets
                                   stretched (almost torn)
to the buckle-tongue, till the fit’s my own,
                                   my anyone’s timing,
and listen—to the doomsday drummer in it—
                                   just for a tick.

in İskenderun or Cairo or God only knows
it fell from my name 
got trampled in dirt, wasn’t
scorpion-crunched but scrambled and scuttled and fashioned 
from dust a magnificent hopalong gung-ho
hop and went 
up
up 
up to a perch in the cleft of a spindly
twig 
not a halo as such nor legible
signage—construed as a fly or an optical 
blur, dashed-off-forever-unfinished notation
inscrutable 
scrap—a blink or a blip, caress, kiss, wince or
half of an upturned 
discarded moustache
who knows? 
but up there for years 
nonchalant
unattributable 
an ahem, an unnoticed notice-me-please 
elliptical 
in the olive trees
