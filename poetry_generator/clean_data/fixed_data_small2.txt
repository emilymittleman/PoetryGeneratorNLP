People sit nibbling before television's flicker watching ghosts chase balls and each other while the skunk is out risking grisly death to cross the highway to mate; while the fox scales the wire fence where it knows the shotgun lurks to taste the sweet blood of a hen. Birds are greedy little bombs bursting to give voice to appetite. I had a cat who died of love. Dogs trail their masters across con- tinents. We are far too busy to be starkly simple in passion.

As if, after a life of enchantment, hehad awakened, like Bottom, wearing the ears of an ass, and the only light was a lanthorn, an ersatz moon. It was not that the calendar hadn’t numbered the dayswith an orbital accuracy, its calculationsexact, but like a man who wants to hang a hammockin his yard, to let its bright net cradle him, but onlyhas one tree, so he—wild and aware of it—knewhe had lost the order he required, and with it, rest—his thoughts only a sagging bundle of loose ends,and the heart, a naked animal in search of a pelt, that once fell for every Large Meaning it could wrap itself in, as organs are packed in ice for transitfrom one ending to the next, an afterlife of parts—andthe whole?

Unnerved,he looks away, watches the last of his ice as it melts, the way some godlike eye might seethe mighty glaciers in a slow dissolve back into sea.He notes how incommensurate the simile, a lastattempt to dignify his shaking gaze, and reachesfor the bill; he’s damned if the goat will pay. \n', '\nI can only give you back what you imagine.I am a soulless man.

Verdelle\n\n\n\nThose mornings I traveled north on I91,passing below the basalt cliff of East Rockwhere the elms discussed their genealogies.I was a chaplain at Hartford Hospital,took the Myers-Briggs with Sister Margaret,learned I was an I drawn to Es.In small group I said, “I do not like it—the way so many young black men die hereunrecognized, their gurneys stripped,their belongings catalogued and unclaimed.”On the neonatal ICU, newborns breathed,blue, spider-delicate in a nest of tubes.A Sunday of themselves, their tissue purpled,their eyelids the film on old water in a well,their faces resigned in their see-through attics,their skin mottled mildewed wallpaper.It is correct to love even at the wrong time.On rounds, the newborns eyed me, each one like Orpheus in his dark hallway, saying:I knew I would find you, I knew I would lose you. ', '\nFirst there was Jim, clamping to my long black hair             that nine-pound Cleopatra wig              with nylon bands and bobbie pins.Meanwhile I was on fire for Chad, who coached me             a bit impatiently Tuesday nights             on my Joan-of-Arc inflection.Then Terence said I’d be perfect for the lounge-singer-             turned-whore, and as it turned out             that was a fairly easy gig.Max signed me on soon after, claiming I was a natural             for Eternally Aggrieved Girl,             which in hindsight hurts me deeply.So by the time you followed me back to the green room             to wait in the hallway—whistling!—             for my scrubbed face to emerge,naturally I was wary, waiting for the script              you never bothered to come up with.             It was damned awkward sitting there,nothing but milkshakes between us. Maybe, I thought,              you’d assumed I was the one with a script.               Finally I decided to give Terence a call.I didn’t like the way you looked at me so steadily             with your chin resting on one fist,             as if the table were a table, the boardsA floor. Listening there as if you meant it,              as if something I could say were true, and every             moment from now on would be my cue.\n', '\nI heard from people after the shootings. People I knew well or barely or not at all. Largely the same message: how horrible it was, how little there was to say about how horrible it was. People wrote, called, mostly e-mailed because they know I teach at Virginia Tech,to say, there’s nothing to say. Eventually I answered these messages: there’s nothing to say back except of course there’s nothing to say, thank you for your willingness to say it. Because this was about nothing. A boy who felt that he was nothing, who erased and entered that erasure, and guns that are good for nothing, and talk of guns that is good for nothing, and spring that is good for flowers, and Jesus for some, and scotch for others, and “and” for me in this poem, “and” that is good for sewing the minutes together, which otherwise go about going away, bereft of us and us of them. Like a scarf left on a train and nothing like a scarf left on a train. As if the train, empty of everything but a scarf, still opens its doors at every stop, because this is what a train does, this is what a man does with his hand on a lever, because otherwise, why the lever, why the hand, and then it was over, and then it had just begun.\n', '\nThere is so much sweetness in children’s voices,And so much discontent at the end of day,And so much satisfaction when a train goes by.I don’t know why the rooster keeps crying,Nor why elephants keep raising their trunks,Nor why Hawthorne kept hearing trains at night.A handsome child is a gift from God,And a friend is a vein in the back of the hand,And a wound is an inheritance from the wind.Some say we are living at the end of time,But I believe a thousand pagan ministersWill arrive tomorrow to baptize the wind.There’s nothing we need to do about John. The BaptistHas been laying his hands on earth for so longThat the well water is sweet for a hundred miles.It’s all right if we don’t know what the roosterIs saying in the middle of the night, nor why we feelSo much satisfaction when a train goes by.\n', '\n                    \n                    \n                    I remember she rented a room on the second floor from Jenny Holtzerman, an Austrian widow. The two women lived on Girard Avenue South, in Kenwood, an elegant suburb of Minneapolis. Any promise of husbands had disappeared long ago. From the kitchen I often remember the jelly smell of a linzer torte. I was in high school and often I eavesdropped. Once, quietly, she said to my mother, “I never knew the love of a man.” She had mentioned having a husband, but during the war they were separated in the chaos of Budapest, and later she lost track of him. Once she showed me her room: the walls were bare with cracks. Her daybed was narrow, barely slept-in. Her room resembled hundreds of scant little rooms around the world, the way it accepted blue and purple-violet detail—on her bureau, no family photographs, instead, playbills autographed by cast members, a calendar tattered, crossed, marked, no jewelry, some coins. Her window sashes warped, her wires shorted and the paint around her doorframe kept chipping off—“like in The Cherry Orchard,” she said, “by Chekhov.” She told a joke in Hungarian to Hannah Tamasek and even I, not knowing a word, laughed. She bowed gently in a mannerism distinctly Viennese and spoke on occasion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She loved the Guthrie Theater, where curtains rose on miniature worlds, preferring memorized dialogue and costumes to something truer. Five feet tall in orthopedic shoes, she limped. Time has a way of rearranging things and I could have most details wrong now, but there was this: during the war, she met a man, whom she gave money to, she did not know the man well, but had trusted him to smuggle her father across the border, the man pocketed the money, bought chocolates for his mistress from Belgium, and placed Margaret’s father on a train to Auschwitz. So it makes sense to me now that simple decisions baffled Margaret. It makes sense to me now that when news reached us of Primo Levi’s suicide, Margaret did not blink. It makes sense to me now that when Dr. Sikorski spoke of fighting in the Warsaw sewers, Margaret said, “I do not believe in God.” Those who saw what they saw grow fewer. Margaret has been dead a long time now. But perhaps you will understand why I chose her, why I have smudged the slow waltz of her smile and added only a few modest blue strokes—here and here. As you leave Margaret behind and turn the page, listen as the page falls back and your hand gently buries her. This is what the past sounds like.\n                ', '\nRoadlight licks the night ahead, licksthe white line on night’s new hide, licksthe undulating blacktop flat, sticks its end-less forking tongue out onward, flicksitself at culvert, tree, passing truck, a signinsisting heartbeats equal conscious life(it may be) of someone’s (maybe my) forever unborn child.

It’s the only thing they catch.No form, no pattern. Just the rolling diceOf idle talk.

No mystery more profoundThan how a melody soars from a stringOf syllables, and yet this much we know:Ronsard was right to emphasize it so,Even in his day. Now, it’s everything:The language falls apart before our eyes,But what it once was echoes in our earsAs poetry, whose gathered force defiesEven the drift of our declining years.A single lilting line, a single turnOf phrase: these always proved, at last we learn,Life cries for joy though it must end in tears.\n', '\nHow is it that you hold such influence over me:your practiced slouch, your porkpie hat at rakish angle,commending the dumpling-shaped lump atop your pelvis—as if we’ve one more thing to consider amidst the striptease of all your stanzas and all your lines—draws me down into the center of you: the prize peony,so that I’m nothing more than an ant whose singular laboris to gather the beading liquid inside you; bring it to light.I have never written a true poem, it seems.

Our sex was a little melodramatic, with a loopy grandeur. And afterwards we were so thirsty.\n\n   We watched the solar eclipse in Dad’s welding helmet, his crusader’s helm, wobbling and blind.\n\n   Our tongue always smarted with the astringent mint of the toothpaste when we moved to the bed, and she was always burning holes in her nylons with those goddamn Pell Mells.\n\n   Sunday night you were alone in the farmhouse, near sunset. It had been a hot day, with cicadas humming in the corn, the sound rising into the hot blue silver. You took a bath, and when you walked into the living room, still a little wet, the curtains planed horizontal, and you could hear distant thunder. The radio was low, playing classical music. The corn leaves were active, but discreet. That night you sat on the front porch steps drinking your son’s Hi-C citrus cooler. A special events floodlight examined the horizon.\n\n   Under a sky thick and like pewter, lying there reading with the window open, you heard a Brooklyn catbird imitate a car alarm, the series of warbles and chirps identical, and in the same sequence. The famous Car Alarm Bird.\n\n   You like the way the brushes sound over the car radio when the drummer plays with a small ensemble. As the station gets further away, the sound of the brushes mixes with static, as though some small bright particles were bunched there at the end of his hands. You worry about the car when you leave the tarmac because the bottom pings with small stones from the hardpan. The red radio towers blink far ahead, and off to the right. Soon you move up under them.\n                ', '\nThere is a wolf in me . . . fangs pointed for tearing gashes . . . a red tongue for raw meat . . . and the hot lapping of blood—I keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me and the wilderness will not let it go.

I sit, I can see other\nthings: a silver porcupine, pins\nstanding upright. It is a vanished tale of a\nvanished forest at the shore of a vanished ocean. \nI call the dead as often as I can. In the\nvaults, among mummies—this is pure\nmemorial. I am the girl in whose\neyes the name is written. \nI feel as if veiled, as if soon I\nshall get to know something. These are people\nwith encephalitis who cannot go\nforward, but can go backward, and can dance. \nIn this rough draft of my memoirs, my brother\ncomes toward me—frightened, skeletal—longing\nfor marvels. I cannot describe it better than by\ncomparing it to other figures, intoxication. \nMere reflexes, as for instance breathing, can become\nconscious. One of two rivals has his\nornamental tail bit off. In dying sounds, barely\nreaching our ears, a melody continues. \nNo end to it—an infinite progression. All this\nlove of a bygone age. Watch the track\nof a concentrated sunbeam through our lake ice:\npart of the beam is stopped, part goes through. \nNow the upper surface buckles, phantasmagoria of\nunchained passion—under which the land\nquakes, the ocean swells, and a myriad-years-\nold forest snaps and cracks. \nSurpassing all forms of experience, the wide, deep,\nfreshwater lake—on which the city\nis built—rises before us. Here a modern idea\ninterposes, a new body made from the elements. \nThen everything is forgotten. Sometimes thoughts\nare cut off and sometimes they are the\nblade which cuts. At the present gravel pit, electric\nlights in the evening cast their magic blue sheen. \nThere’s the sun, a crack above those\nhills, breaking the day. If the door open, who\ncomes in? If it close, what will interrupt\nmy train? \nThe staircase effect supplies strong evidence\nfor a subjective map. Downhill, the sun\ntrickles, unperturbed. Here trots a mammoth with\nred wool, through the black yew forest. \nThe tendency of elements to linger on: You say\nI dream of what I want, but what I\nwant now is to dream. The cold rind\nbroken, the same wind blows. \nThrough a lens of ice, the dark\nheat of the sun burns wood, fires gunpowder, melts\nlead. Perhaps a cloud of musk rises, such as\nissues from a crocodile in passion. \nUnless light falls properly upon these\nflowers, you cannot see them. All associations at\nthis level rain down from above. We\ntalk of word-pictures. \nWe observe vertigo. We reach the cleft\nby a steep gully or couloir—very dangerous, the\npath from the heights, the glory of\nthe prospect, the insight gained. \nWhat I mean is a disturbance in\nall the senses at once.

Dasher, now! Dancer, now! Prancer, and Vixen,“On! Comet, on! Cupid, on! Dunder and Blixem;“To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!“Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!”As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly,When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,With the sleigh full of Toys — and St. Nicholas too:And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.As I drew in my head, and was turning around,Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound:He was dress’d all in fur, from his head to his foot,And his clothes were all tarnish’d with ashes and soot;A bundle of toys was flung on his back,And he look’d like a peddler just opening his pack:His eyes — how they twinkled! his dimples how merry,His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow.And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.He had a broad face, and a little round bellyThat shook when he laugh’d, like a bowl full of jelly:He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,And I laugh’d when I saw him in spite of myself;A wink of his eye and a twist of his headSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,And fill’d all the stockings; then turn’d with a jerk,And laying his finger aside of his noseAnd giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.He sprung to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,And away they all flew, like the down of a thistle:But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight —Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night.\n', "\nDear love, where the red lillies blossomed and grew,The white snows are falling;And all through the wood, where I wandered with you,The loud winds are calling;And the robin that piped to us tune upon tune,Neath the elm—you remember,Over tree-top and mountain has followed the June,And left us—December.Has left, like a friend that is true in the sun,And false in the shadows.He has found new delights, in the land where he's gone,Greener woodlands and meadows.What care we? let him go! let the snow shroud the lea,Let it drift on the heather!We can sing through it all; I have you—you have me,And we’ll laugh at the weather.The old year may die, and a new one be bornThat is bleaker and colder;But it cannot dismay us; we dare it—we scorn,For love makes us bolder.Ah Robin! sing loud on the far-distant lea,Thou friend in fair weather;But here is a song sung, that’s fuller of glee,By two warm hearts together.\n", '\nIn the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,In the bleak midwinter, long ago.Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficedThe Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day,Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;Enough for Him, whom angels fall before,The ox and ass and camel which adore.Angels and archangels may have gathered there,Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.What can I give Him, poor as I am?If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.\n', '\nThe Poetry of earth is never dead:      When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,      And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run    From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;    That is the Grasshopper’s—he takes the lead         In summer luxury,—he has never done      With his delights; for when tired out with fun    He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.    The poetry of earth is ceasing never:      On a lone winter evening, when the frost          Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills    The Cricket’s song, in warmth increasing ever,      And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,        The Grasshopper’s among some grassy hills.\n', '\nChristmas Eve, and twelve of the clock.“Now they are all on their knees,”An elder said as we sat in a flockBy the embers in hearthside ease.We pictured the meek mild creatures whereThey dwelt in their strawy pen,Nor did it occur to one of us thereTo doubt they were kneeling then.So fair a fancy few would weaveIn these years! Yet, I feel,If someone said on Christmas Eve,“Come; see the oxen kneel,“In the lonely barton by yonder coombOur childhood used to know,”I should go with him in the gloom,Hoping it might be so.\n', '\n    See, Winter comes to rule the varied year,Sullen and sad, with all his rising train—Vapours, and clouds, and storms. Be these my theme,These, that exalt the soul to solemn thoughtAnd heavenly musing. Welcome, kindred glooms!Congenial horrors, hail! With frequent foot,Pleas’d have I, in my cheerful morn of life,When nurs’d by careless solitude I liv’dAnd sung of Nature with unceasing joy,Pleas’d have I wander’d through your rough domain;Trod the pure virgin-snows, myself as pure;Heard the winds roar, and the big torrent burst;Or seen the deep-fermenting tempest brew’dIn the grim evening-sky. Thus pass’d the time,Till through the lucid chambers of the southLook’d out the joyous Spring—look’d out and smil’d.     Now, when the cheerless empire of the skyTo Capricorn the Centaur-Archer yields,And fierce Aquarius stains th’ inverted year,Hung o’er the farthest verge of heaven, the sunScarce spreads o’er ether the dejected day.Faint are his gleams, and ineffectual shootHis struggling rays in horizontal linesThrough the thick air; as cloth’d in cloudy storm,Weak, wan, and broad, he skirts the southern sky;And, soon descending, to the long dark night,Wide-shading all, the prostrate world resigns.Nor is the night unwish’d; while vital heat,Light, life, and joy the dubious day forsake.Meantime, in sable cincture, shadows vast,Deep-ting’d and damp, and congregated clouds,And all the vapoury turbulence of heavenInvolve the face of things. Thus Winter falls,A heavy gloom oppressive o’er the world,Through Nature shedding influence malign,And rouses up the seeds of dark disease.The soul of man dies in him, loathing life,And black with more than melancholy views.The cattle droop; and o’er the furrow’d land,Fresh from the plough, the dun discolour’d flocks,Untended spreading, crop the wholesome root.Along the woods, along the moorish fens,Sighs the sad genius of the coming storm;And up among the loose disjointed cliffsAnd fractur’d mountains wild, the brawling brookAnd cave, presageful, sends a hollow moan,Resounding long in listening Fancy’s ear.     Nature! great parent! whose unceasing handRolls round the seasons of the changeful year,How mighty, how majestic are thy works!With what a pleasing dread they swell the soul,That sees astonish’d, and astonish’d sings!Ye too, ye winds! that now begin to blowWith boisterous sweep, I raise my voice to you.Where are your stores, ye powerful beings! say,Where your a{:e}rial magazines reserv’d,To swell the brooding terrors of the storm?In what far-distant region of the sky,Hush’d in deep silence, sleep you when ‘tis calm?     When from the pallid sky the sun descends,With many a spot, that o’er his glaring orbUncertain wanders, stain’d; red fiery streaksBegin to flush around. The reeling cloudsStagger with dizzy poise, as doubting yetWhich master to obey; while, rising slow,Blank in the leaden-colour’d east, the moonWears a wan circle round her blunted horns.Seen through the turbid, fluctuating air,The stars obtuse emit a shivering ray;Or frequent seem to shoot athwart the gloom,And long behind them trail the whitening blaze.Snatch’d in short eddies, plays the wither’d leaf;And on the flood the dancing feather floats.With broaden’d nostrils to the sky upturn’d,The conscious heifer snuffs the stormy gale.Even as the matron, at her nightly task,With pensive labour draws the flaxen thread,The wasted taper and the crackling flameForetell the blast. But chief the plumy race,The tenants of the sky, its changes speak.Retiring from the downs, where all day longThey pick’d their scanty fare, a black’ning trainOf clamorous rooks thick-urge their weary flight,And seek the closing shelter of the grove.Assiduous, in his bower, the wailing owlPlies his sad song. The cormorant on highWheels from the deep, and screams along the land.Loud shrieks the soaring hern; and with wild wingThe circling sea-fowl cleave the flaky clouds.Ocean, unequal press’d, with broken tideAnd blind commotion heaves; while from the shore,Eat into caverns by the restless wave,And forest-rustling mountain comes a voiceThat, solemn-sounding, bids the world prepare.Then issues forth the storm with sudden burst,And hurls the whole precipitated airDown in a torrent. On the passive mainDescends th’ ethereal force, and with strong gustTurns from its bottom the discolour’d deep.Through the black night that sits immense around,Lash’d into foam, the fierce-conflicting brineSeems o’er a thousand raging waves to burn.Meantime the mountain-billows, to the cloudsIn dreadful tumult swell’d, surge above surge,Burst into chaos with tremendous roar,And anchor’d navies from their stations drive,Wild as the winds across the howling wasteOf mighty waters: now th’ inflated waveStraining they scale, and now impetuous shootInto the secret chambers of the deep,The wintry Baltic thund’ring o’er their head.Emerging thence again, before the breathOf full-exerted heaven they wing their course,And dart on distant coasts, if some sharp rockOr shoal insidious break not their career,And in loose fragments fling them floating round.     Nor less at hand the loosen’d tempest reigns.The mountain thunders, and its sturdy sonsStoop to the bottom of the rocks they shade.Lone on the midnight steep, and all aghast,The dark wayfaring stranger breathless toils,And, often falling, climbs against the blast.Low waves the rooted forest, vex’d, and shedsWhat of its tarnish’d honours yet remain;Dash’d down and scatter’d, by the tearing wind’sAssiduous fury, its gigantic limbs.Thus struggling through the dissipated grove,The whirling tempest raves along the plain;And, on the cottage thatch’d or lordly roof,Keen-fastening, shakes them to the solid base.Sleep frighted flies; and round the rocking dome,For entrance eager, howls the savage blast.Then too, they say, through all the burden’d airLong groans are heard, shrill sounds, and distant sighs,That, utter’d by the demon of the night,Warn the devoted wretch of woe and death.     Huge uproar lords it wide. The clouds, commix’dWith stars swift-gliding, sweep along the sky.All Nature reels: till Nature’s King, who oftAmid tempestuous darkness dwells alone,And on the wings of the careering windWalks dreadfully serene, commands a calm;Then straight air, sea, and earth are hush’d at once.     As yet ‘tis midnight deep. The weary clouds,Slow-meeting, mingle into solid gloom.Now, while the drowsy world lies lost in sleep,Let me associate with the serious Night,And Contemplation, her sedate compeer;Let me shake off th’ intrusive cares of day,And lay the meddling senses all aside.     Where now, ye lying vanities of life!Ye ever-tempting, ever-cheating train!Where are you now? and what is your amount?Vexation, disappointment, and remorse.Sad, sick’ning thought! and yet deluded man,A scene of crude disjointed visions past,And broken slumbers, rises still resolv’d,With new-flush’d hopes, to run the giddy round.     Father of light and life! thou Good Supreme!O teach me what is good! teach me Thyself!Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,From every low pursuit; and feed my soulWith knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure,Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!     The keener tempests come; and, fuming dunFrom all the livid east or piercing north,Thick clouds ascend, in whose capacious wombA vapoury deluge lies, to snow congeal’d.Heavy they roll their fleecy world along,And the sky saddens with the gather’d storm.Through the hush’d air the whitening shower descends,At first thin-wavering; till at last the flakesFall broad and wide and fast, dimming the dayWith a continual flow. The cherish’d fieldsPut on their winter robe of purest white.‘Tis brightness all; save where the new snow meltsAlong the mazy current. Low the woodsBow their hoar head; and, ere the languid sun,Faint from the west, emits his evening ray,Earth’s universal face, deep-hid and chill,Is one wild dazzling waste, that buries wideThe works of man. Drooping, the labourer-oxStands cover’d o’er with snow, and then demandsThe fruit of all his toil. The fowls of heaven,Tam’d by the cruel season, crowd aroundThe winnowing store, and claim the little boonWhich Providence assigns them. One alone,The redbreast, sacred to the household gods,Wisely regardful of th’ embroiling sky,In joyless fields and thorny thickets leavesHis shivering mates, and pays to trusted manHis annual visit. Half-afraid, he firstAgainst the window beats; then, brisk, alightsOn the warm hearth; then hopping o’er the floor,Eyes all the smiling family askance,And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is;Till, more familiar grown, the table-crumbsAttract his slender feet. The foodless wildsPour forth their brown inhabitants. The hare,Though timorous of heart, and hard besetBy death in various forms, dark snares, and dogs,And more unpitying men, the garden seeks,Urg’d on by fearless want. The bleating kindEye the bleak heaven, and next the glistening earth,With looks of dumb despair; then, sad-dispers’d,Dig for the wither’d herb through heaps of snow.     Now, shepherds, to your helpless charge be kind;Baffle the raging year, and fill their pensWith food at will; lodge them below the storm,And watch them strict: for, from the bellowing east,In this dire season, oft the whirlwind’s wingSweeps up the burden of whole wintry plainsIn one wide waft, and o’er the hapless flocks,Hid in the hollow of two neighbouring hills,The billowy tempest whelms; till, upward urg’d,The valley to a shinning mountain swells,Tipp’d with a wreath high-curling in the sky.     Ah! little think the gay licentious proud,Whom pleasure, power, and affluence surround—They, who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth,And wanton, often cruel, riot waste—Ah! little think they, while they dance along,How many feel, this very moment, deathAnd all the sad variety of pain;How many sink in the devouring flood,Or more devouring flame; how many bleed,By shameful variance betwixt man and man;How many pine in want, and dungeon-glooms,Shut from the common air and common useOf their own limbs; how many drink the cupOf baleful grief, or eat the bitter breadOf misery; sore pierc’d by wintry winds,How many shrink into the sordid hutOf cheerless poverty; how many shakeWith all the fiercer tortures of the mind,Unbounded passion, madness, guilt, remorse;Whence, tumbled headlong from the height of life,They furnish matter for the tragic muse.Even in the vale, where wisdom loves to dwell,With friendship, peace, and contemplation join’d,How many, rack’d with honest passions, droopIn deep retir’d distress, how many standAround the death-bed of their dearest friends,And point the parting anguish! Thought fond manOf these, and all the thousand nameless illsThat one incessant struggle render life,One scene of toil, of suffering, and of fate,Vice in his high career would stand appall’d,And heedless rambling Impulse learn to think;The conscious heart of Charity would warm,And her wide wish Benevolence dilate;The social tear would rise, the social sigh;And, into clear perfection, gradual bliss,Refining still, the social passions work.     Now, all amid the rigours of the year,In the wild depth of winter, while withoutThe ceaseless winds blow ice, be my retreat,Between the groaning forest and the shore,Beat by the boundless multitude of waves,A rural, shelter’d, solitary scene;Where ruddy fire and beaming tapers joinTo cheer the gloom. There studious let me sit,And hold high converse with the mighty dead:Sages of ancient time, as gods rever’d,As gods beneficent, who bless’d mankindWith arts and arms, and humaniz’d a world.Rous’d at th’ inspiring thought, I throw asideThe long-liv’d volume, and deep-musing hailThe sacred shades that slowly rising passBefore my wandering eyes. First Socrates,Who, firmly good in a corrupted state,Against the rage of tyrants single stoodInvincible! calm reason’s holy law,That voice of God within th’ attentive mind,Obeying, fearless or in life or death:Great moral teacher! wisest of mankind!Solon the next, who built his commonwealOn equity’s wide base; by tender lawsA lively people curbing, yet undamp’dPreserving still that quick peculiar fire,Whence in the laurel’d field of finer arts,And of bold freedom, they unequal’d shone,The pride of smiling Greece and human-kind.Lycurgus then, who bow’d beneath the forceOf strictest discipline, severely wise,All human passions. Following him I see,As at Thermopylae he glorious fell,The firm devoted chief, who prov’d by deedsThe hardest lesson which the other taught.Then Aristides lifts his honest front;Spotless of heart, to whom th’ unflattering voiceOf freedom gave the noblest name of Just;In pure majestic poverty rever’d;Who, ev’n his glory to his country’s wealSubmitting, swell’d a haughty rival’s fame.Rear’d by his care, of softer ray appearsCimon, sweet-soul’d; whose genius, rising strong,Shook off the load of young debauch; abroadThe scourge of Persian pride, at home the friendOf every worth and every splendid art;Modest and simple in the pomp of wealth.     Of rougher front, a mighty people come,A race of heroes! in those virtuous timesWhich knew no stain, save that with partial flameTheir dearest country they too fondly lov’d.Her better founder first, the Light of Rome,Numa, who soften’d her rapacious sons;Servius the king, who laid the solid baseOn which o’er earth the vast republic spread.Then the great consuls venerable rise:The public father who the private quell’d,As on the dread tribunal, sternly sad;He, whom his thankless country could not lose,Camillus, only vengeful to her foes;Fabricius, scorner of all-conquering gold,And Cincinnatus, awful from the plough;Thy willing victim, Carthage! bursting looseFrom all that pleading Nature could oppose,From a whole city’s tears, by rigid faithImperious call’d, and honour’s dire command;Scipio, the gentle chief, humanely brave,Who soon the race of spotless glory ran,And, warm in youth, to the poetic shadeWith friendship and philosophy retir’d;Tully, whose powerful eloquence a whileRestrain’d the rapid fate of rushing Rome;Unconquer’d Cato, virtuous in extreme;And thou, unhappy Brutus, kind of heart,Whose steady arm, by awful virtue urg’d,Lifted the Roman steel against thy friend.Thousands besides the tribute of a verseDemand; but who can count the stars of heaven.Who sing their influence on this lower world?     Behold, who yonder comes! in sober state,Fair, mild, and strong as is a vernal sun:‘Tis Phoebus’ self, or else the Mantuan swain!Great Homer too appears, of daring wing,Parent of song! and equal by his side,The British Muse; join’d hand in hand they walk,Darkling, full up the middle steep to fame.Nor absent are those shades, whose skilful handPathetic drew th’ impassion’d heart, and charm’dTransported Athens with the moral scene;Nor those who, tuneful, wak’d th’ enchanting lyre.     First of your kind! society divine!Still visit thus my nights, for you reserv’d,And mount my soaring soul to thoughts like yours.Silence, thou lonely power! the door be thine;See on the hallow’d hour that none intrude,Save a few chosen friends, that sometimes deignTo bless my humble roof, with sense refin’d,Learning digested well, exalted faith,Unstudied wit, and humour ever gay.Or from the Muses’ hill will Pope descend,To raise the sacred hour, to bid it smile,And with the social spirit warm the heart;For, though not sweeter his own Homer sings,Yet is his life the more endearing song.     The city swarms intense. The public haunt,Full of each theme and warm with mix’d discourse,Hums indistinct. The sons of riot flowDown the loose stream of false enchanted joyTo swift destruction. On the rankled soulThe gaming fury falls; and in one gulfOf total ruin, honour, virtue, peace,Friends, families, and fortune headlong sink.Up-springs the dance along the lighted dome,Mix’d and evolv’d a thousand sprightly ways.The glitt’ring court effuses every pomp;The circle deepens; beam’d with gaudy robes,Tapers, and sparkling gems, and radiant eyes,A soft effulgence o’er the palace waves:While a gay insect in his summer shine,The fop, light-flutt’ring, spreads his mealy wings.     Dread o’er the scene the ghost of Hamlet stalks;Othello rages; poor Monimia mourns;And Belvidera pours her soul in love.Deep-thrilling terror shakes; the comely tearSteals o’er the cheek: or else the comic museHolds to the world a picture of itself,And raises sly the fair impartial laugh.Sometimes she lifts her strain, and paints the scenesOf beauteous life; whate’er can deck mankind,Or charm the heart, in generous Bevil show’d.     O thou, whose wisdom, solid yet refin’d,Whose patriot virtues, and consummate skillTo touch the finer springs that move the world,Join’d to whate’er the graces can bestow,And all Apollo’s animating fire,Give thee with pleasing dignity to shineAt once the guardian, ornament, and joyOf polish’d life; permit the rural muse,O Chesterfield, to grace thee with her song.Ere to the shades again she humbly flies,Indulge her fond ambition, in thy train(For every muse has in thy train a place)To mark thy various full-accomplish’d mind,To mark that spirit which with British scornRejects th’ allurements of corrupted power;That elegant politeness which excels,Ev’n in the judgment of presumptuous France,The boasted manners of her shining court;That wit, the vivid energy of sense,The truth of nature, which, with Attic pointAnd kind well-temper’d satire, smoothly keen,Steals through the soul and without pain corrects.Or, rising thence with yet a brighter flame,O let me hail thee on some glorious day,When to the listening senate ardent crowdBritannia’s sons to hear her pleaded cause!Then, dress’d by thee, more amiably fair,Truth the soft robe of mild persuasion wears;Thou to assenting reason giv’st againHer own enlighten’d thoughts; call’d from the heart,Th’ obedient passions on thy voice attend;     And ev’n reluctant party feels a whileThy gracious power, as through the varied mazeOf eloquence, now smooth, now quick, now strong,Profound and clear, you roll the copious flood.     To thy lov’d haunt return, my happy muse:For now, behold! the joyous Winter days,Frosty, succeed; and through the blue serene,For sight too fine, th’ ethereal nitre flies,Killing infectious damps, and the spent airStoring afresh with elemental life.Close crowds the shining atmosphere; and bindsOur strengthen’d bodies in its cold embrace,Constringent; feeds, and animates our blood;Refines our spirits, through the new-strung nervesIn swifter sallies darting to the brain;Where sits the soul, intense, collected, cool,Bright as the skies, and as the season keen.All nature feels the renovating forceOf Winter, only to the thoughtless eyeIn ruin seen. The frost-concocted glebeDraws in abundant vegetable soul,And gathers vigour for the coming year;A stronger glow sits on the lively cheekOf ruddy fire; and luculent alongThe purer rivers flow: their sullen deeps,Transparent, open to the shepherd’s gaze,And murmur hoarser at the fixing frost.     What art thou, frost? and whence are thy keen storesDeriv’d, thou secret all-invading power,Whom ev’n th’ illusive fluid cannot fly?Is not thy potent energy, unseen,Myriads of little salts, or hook’d, or shap’dLike double wedges, and diffus’d immenseThrough water, earth, and ether? Hence at eve,Steam’d eager from the red horizon round,With the fierce rage of Winter deep suffus’d,An icy gale, oft shifting, o’er the poolBreathes a blue film, and in its mid-careerArrests the bickering stream. The loosen’d ice,Let down the flood and half dissolv’d by day,Rustles no more; but to the sedgy bankFast grows, or gathers round the pointed stone,A crystal pavement, by the breath of heavenCemented firm; till, seiz’d from shore to shore,The whole imprison’d river growls below.Loud rings the frozen earth, and hard reflectsA double noise; while, at his evening watch,The village-dog deters the nightly thief;The heifer lows, the distant waterfallSwells in the breeze; and with the hasty treadOf traveller the hollow-sounding plainShakes from afar. The full ethereal round,Infinite worlds disclosing to the view,Shines out intensely keen, and, all one copeOf starry glitter, glows from pole to pole.From pole to pole the rigid influence fallsThrough the still night, incessant, heavy, strong,And seizes nature fast. It freezes on,Till morn, late-rising o’er the drooping world,Lifts her pale eye unjoyous. Then appearsThe various labour of the silent night:Prone from the dripping eave, and dumb cascade,Whose idle torrents only seem to roar,The pendant icicle; the frost-work fair,Where transient hues and fancy’d figures rise;Wide-spouted o’er the hill the frozen brook,A livid tract, cold-gleaming on the morn;The forest bent beneath the plumy wave;And by the frost refin’d the whiter snowIncrusted hard, and sounding to the treadOf early shepherd, as he pensive seeksHis pining flock, or from the mountain top,Pleas’d with the slippery surface, swift descends.     ‘Tis done! Dread Winter spreads his latest glooms,And reigns tremendous o’er the conquer’d year.How dead the vegetable kingdom lies!How dumb the tuneful! Horror wide extendsHis melancholy empire. Here, fond man!Behold thy pictur’d life; pass some few years,Thy flowering Spring, thy Summer’s ardent strength,Thy sober Autumn fading into age,And pale concluding Winter comes at lastAnd shuts the scene. Ah! whither now are fledThose dreams of greatness? those unsolid hopesOf happiness? those longings after fame?Those restless cares? those busy bustling days?Those gay-spent festive nights? those veering thoughts,Lost between good and ill, that shared thy life?All now are vanish’d! Virtue sole survives,Immortal, never-failing friend of man,His guide to happiness on high. And see!‘Tis come, the glorious morn! the second birthOf heaven and earth! awakening nature hearsThe new-creating word, and starts to lifeIn every heighten’d form, from pain and deathFor ever free. The great eternal scheme,Involving all, and in a perfect wholeUniting, as the prospect wider spreads,To reason’s eye refin’d clears up apace.Ye vainly wise! ye blind presumptuous! now,Confounded in the dust, adore that PowerAnd Wisdom oft arraign’d: see now the causeWhy unassuming worth in secret liv’dAnd died neglected: why the good man’s shareIn life was gall and bitterness of soul:Why the lone widow and her orphans pin’dIn starving solitude; while luxuryIn palaces lay straining her low thoughtTo form unreal wants: why heaven-born truthAnd moderation fair wore the red marksOf superstition’s scourge; why licens’d pain,That cruel spoiler, that embosom’d foe,Embitter’d all our bliss. Ye good distress’d!Ye noble few! who here unbending standBeneath life’s pressure, yet a little while,And what your bounded view, which only sawA little part, deem’d evil is no more:The storms of wintry time will quickly pass,And one unbounded Spring encircle all.\n', '\nJanuarie. Ægloga prima. ARGVMENT.    IN this fyrst Æglogue Colin clout a shepheardes boy complaineth him of his vnfortunate loue, being but newly (as semeth) enamoured of a countrie lasse called Rosalinde: with which strong affection being very sore traueled, he compareth his carefull case to the sadde season of the yeare, to the frostie ground, to the frosen trees, and to his owne winterbeaten flocke. And lastlye, fynding himselfe robbed of all former pleasaunce and delights, hee breaketh his Pipe in peeces, and casteth him selfe to the ground.COLIN Cloute.A Shepeheards boye (no better doe him call) when Winters wastful spight was almost spent, All in a sunneshine day, as did befall, Led forth his flock, that had been long ypent. So faynt they woxe, and feeble in the folde, That now vnnethes their feete could them vphold. All as the Sheepe, such was the shepeheards looke, For pale and wanne he was, (alas the while,) May seeme he lovd, or els some care he tooke: Well couth he tune his pipe, and frame his stile. Tho to a hill his faynting flocke he ledde, And thus him playnd, the while his shepe there fedde. Ye gods of loue, that pitie louers payne, (if any gods the paine of louers pitie:) Looke from aboue, where you in ioyes remaine, And bowe your eares vnto my doleful dittie. And Pan thou shepheards God, that once didst loue, Pitie the paines, that thou thy selfe didst proue. Thou barrein ground, whome winters wrath hath wasted, Art made a myrrhour, to behold my plight: Whilome thy fresh spring flowrd, and after hasted Thy sommer prowde with Daffadillies dight. And now is come thy wynters stormy state, Thy mantle mard, wherein thou mas-kedst late. Such rage as winters, reigneth in my heart, My life bloud friesing wtih vnkindly cold: Such stormy stoures do breede my balefull smarte, As if my yeare were wast, and woxen old. And yet alas, but now my spring begonne, And yet alas, yt is already donne. You naked trees, whose shady leaves are lost, Wherein the byrds were wont to build their bowre: And now are clothd with mosse and hoary frost, Instede of bloosmes, wherwith your buds did flowre: I see your teares, that from your boughes doe raine, Whose drops in drery ysicles remaine. All so my lustfull leafe is drye and sere, My timely buds with wayling all are wasted: The blossome, which my braunch of youth did beare, With breathed sighes is blowne away, & blasted, And from mine eyes the drizling teares descend, As on your boughes the ysicles depend. Thou feeble flocke, whose fleece is rough and rent, Whose knees are weak through fast and evill fare: Mayst witnesse well by thy ill gouernement, Thy maysters mind is ouercome with care. Thou weak, I wanne: thou leabe, I quite forlorne: With mourning pyne I, you with pyning mourne. A thousand sithes I curse that carefull hower, Wherein I longd the neighbour towne to see: And eke tenne thousand sithes I blesse the stoure, Wherein I sawe so fayre a sight, as shee. Yet all for naught: snch [such] sight hath bred my bane. Ah God, that loue should breede both ioy and payne. It is not Hobbinol, wherefore I plaine, Albee my loue he seeke with dayly suit: His clownish gifts and curtsies I disdaine, His kiddes, his cracknelles, and his early fruit. Ah foolish Hobbinol, thy gyfts bene vayne: Colin them gives to Rosalind againe. I loue thilke lasse, (alas why doe I loue?) And am forlorne, (alas why am I lorne?) Shee deignes not my good will, but doth reproue, And of my rurall musick holdeth scorne. Shepheards deuise she hateth as the snake, And laughes the songes, that Colin Clout doth make.

And they flew down a mightier force at night, As though in heaven there was revolt and riot, And they, frail things had taken panic flight Down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet. I went to bed and rose at early dawn To see them huddled together in a heap, Each merged into the other upon the lawn, Worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep. The sun shone brightly on them half the day, By night they stealthily had stol’n away.      II And suddenly my thoughts then turned to you Who came to me upon a winter’s night, When snow-sprites round my attic window flew, Your hair disheveled, eyes aglow with light. My heart was like the weather when you came, The wanton winds were blowing loud and long; But you, with joy and passion all aflame, You danced and sang a lilting summer song. I made room for you in my little bed, Took covers from the closet fresh and warm, A downful pillow for your scented head, And lay down with you resting in my arm. You went with Dawn. You left me ere the day, The lonely actor of a dreamy play. \n', '\nThe wintry west extends his blast,And hail and rain does blaw;Or, the stormy north sends driving forthThe blinding sleet and snaw:While tumbling brown, the burn comes down,And roars frae bank to brae;And bird and beast in covert rest,And pass the heartless day.The sweeping blast, the sky o’ercast,The joyless winter-day,Let others fear, to me more dearThan all the pride of May:The tempest’s howl, it soothes my soul,My griefs it seems to join;The leafless trees my fancy please,Their fate resembles mine!Thou Pow’r Supreme, whose mighty schemeThese woes of mine fulfil,Here, firm, I rest, they must be best,Because they are Thy will!Then all I want (O, do Thou grantThis one request of mine!)Since to enjoy Thou dost deny,Assist me to resign.\n', "\nCame the dread Archer up yonder lawn —Night is the time for the old to die —But woe for an arrow that smote the fawn,When the hind that was sick unscathed went by.Father lay moaning, Her fault was sore(Night is the time when the old must die),Yet, ah to bless her, my child, once more,For heart is failing: the end is nigh.Daughter, my daughter, my girl, I cried(Night is the time for the old to die)Woe for the wish if till morn ye bide —Dark was the welkin and wild the sky.Heavily plunged from the roof the snow —(Night is the time when the old will die),She answered, My mother, 'tis well, I go.Sparkled the north star, the wrack flew high.First at his head, and last at his feet(Night is the time when the old should die),Kneeling I watched till his soul did fleet,None else that loved him, none else were nigh.I wept in the night as the desolate weep(Night is the time for the old to die),Cometh my daughter? the drifts are deep,Across the cold hollows how white they lie.I sought her afar through the spectral trees(Night is the time when the old must die),The fells were all muffled, the floods did freeze,And a wrathful moon hung red in the sky.By night I found her where pent waves steal(Night is the time when the old should die),But she lay stiff by the locked mill-wheel,And the old stars lived in their homes on high.\n", '\nI went out at night alone; The young blood flowing beyond the seaSeemed to have drenched my spirit’s wings— I bore my sorrow heavily.But when I lifted up my head From shadows shaken on the snow,I saw Orion in the east Burn steadily as long ago.From windows in my father’s house, Dreaming my dreams on winter nights,I watched Orion as a girl Above another city’s lights.Years go, dreams go, and youth goes too, The world’s heart breaks beneath its wars,All things are changed, save in the east The faithful beauty of the stars.\n', '\nThe high school kids are so beautiful in their lavender blouses and crisp white shirts.  They open their mouths to sing with that far-off stare they had looking out from the crib.  Their voices lift up from the marble bed of the high altar to the blue endless ceiling  of heaven as depicted in the cloudy dome— and we—as the parents—crane our necks  to see our children and what is above us— and ahead of us—until the end when we  are invited up to sing with them—sopranos and altos—tenors and basses—to sing the great  Hallelujah Chorus—and I’m standing with the other stunned and gray fathers—holding our sheet music—  searching for our parts—and we realize— our voices are surprisingly rich—experienced—  For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth— and how do we all know to come in  at exactly the right moment?—Forever and ever— and how can it not seem that we shall reign  forever and ever—in one voice with our beautiful children—looking out into all those lights. \n', '\nThe food is on the table. Turkey tanned to a cowboy boot luster, potatoes mashed and mounded in a bowl whose lip is lined with blue flowers linked by grey vines faded from washing. Everyone’s heads have turned to elongate the table’s view—a last supper twisted toward a horizon where the Christmas tree, crowned by a window, sets into itself half inclined.   Each belly cries. Each pair of eyes admonished by Aunt Photographer. Look up. You’re wined and dined for the older folks who’ve pined to see your faces, your lives, lightly framed in this moment’s flash. Parents are moved, press their children’s heads up from the table, hide their hunger by rubbing lightly wrinkled hands atop their laps. They’ll hold the image as long as need be, seconds away from grace. \n', '\nWater rocks the hull of the ship and the dark night comes on the waves\n    against the dark wood taken from the forests on

Before the tall legs of my presence, he bristles and shakes his ruby comb.  Little man, I want to say the hens know who they are. I want to ease his mistaken burden, want him to crow with the plain ecstasy of morning light as it finds its winter way above the woods.  Poor outnumbered fellow, how did he come to believe that on his plumed shoulders lay the safety of an entire flock? I run my hand down the rippled brindle of his back, urge him to relax, drink in the female pleasures that surround him, of egg laying, of settling warm-breasted in the nest of this brief and feathered time. \n', '\n1. \nI am thirty this November.\nYou are still small, in your fourth year.\nWe stand watching the yellow leaves go queer,\nflapping in the winter rain,\nfalling flat and washed. And I remember\nmostly the three autumns you did not live here.\nThey said I’d never get you back again.\nI tell you what you’ll never really know:\nall the medical hypothesis\nthat explained my brain will never be as true as these\nstruck leaves letting go. \nI, who chose two times\nto kill myself, had said your nickname\nthe mewling months when you first came;\nuntil a fever rattled\nin your throat and I moved like a pantomime\nabove your head. Ugly angels spoke to me. The blame,\nI heard them say, was mine. They tattled\nlike green witches in my head, letting doom\nleak like a broken faucet;\nas if doom had flooded my belly and filled your bassinet,\nan old debt I must assume. \nDeath was simpler than I’d thought.\nThe day life made you well and whole\nI let the witches take away my guilty soul.\nI pretended I was dead\nuntil the white men pumped the poison out,\nputting me armless and washed through the rigamarole\nof talking boxes and the electric bed.\nI laughed to see the private iron in that hotel.\nToday the yellow leaves\ngo queer. You ask me where they go. I say today believed\nin itself, or else it fell. \nToday, my small child, Joyce,\nlove your self’s self where it lives.\nThere is no special God to refer to; or if there is,\nwhy did I let you grow\nin another place. You did not know my voice\nwhen I came back to call. All the superlatives\nof tomorrow’s white tree and mistletoe\nwill not help you know the holidays you had to miss.\nThe time I did not love\nmyself, I visited your shoveled walks; you held my glove.\nThere was new snow after this.  \n2. \nThey sent me letters with news\nof you and I made moccasins that I would never use.\nWhen I grew well enough to tolerate\nmyself, I lived with my mother. Too late,\ntoo late, to live with your mother, the witches said.\nBut I didn’t leave. I had my portrait\ndone instead. \nPart way back from Bedlam\nI came to my mother’s house in Gloucester,\nMassachusetts. And this is how I came\nto catch at her; and this is how I lost her.\nI cannot forgive your suicide, my mother said.\nAnd she never could. She had my portrait\ndone instead. \nI lived like an angry guest,\nlike a partly mended thing, an outgrown child.\nI remember my mother did her best.\nShe took me to Boston and had my hair restyled.\nYour smile is like your mother’s, the artist said.\nI didn’t seem to care. I had my portrait\ndone instead. \nThere was a church where I grew up\nwith its white cupboards where they locked us up,\nrow by row, like puritans or shipmates\nsinging together. My father passed the plate.\nToo late to be forgiven now, the witches said.\nI wasn’t exactly forgiven. They had my portrait\ndone instead.  \n3. \nAll that summer sprinklers arched\nover the seaside grass.\nWe talked of drought\nwhile the salt-parched\nfield grew sweet again. To help time pass\nI tried to mow the lawn\nand in the morning I had my portrait done,\nholding my smile in place, till it grew formal.\nOnce I mailed you a picture of a rabbit\nand a postcard of Motif number one,\nas if it were normal\nto be a mother and be gone. \nThey hung my portrait in the chill\nnorth light, matching\nme to keep me well.\nOnly my mother grew ill.\nShe turned from me, as if death were catching,\nas if death transferred,\nas if my dying had eaten inside of her.\nThat August you were two, but I timed my days with doubt.\nOn the first of September she looked at me\nand said I gave her cancer.\nThey carved her sweet hills out\nand still I couldn’t answer.  \n4. \nThat winter she came\npart way back\nfrom her sterile suite\nof doctors, the seasick\ncruise of the X-ray,\nthe cells’ arithmetic\ngone wild. Surgery incomplete,\nthe fat arm, the prognosis poor, I heard\nthem say. \nDuring the sea blizzards\nshe had her\nown portrait painted.\nA cave of mirror\nplaced on the south wall;\nmatching smile, matching contour.\nAnd you resembled me; unacquainted\nwith my face, you wore it. But you were mine\nafter all. \nI wintered in Boston,\nchildless bride,\nnothing sweet to spare\nwith witches at my side.\nI missed your babyhood,\ntried a second suicide,\ntried the sealed hotel a second year.\nOn April Fool you fooled me. We laughed and this\nwas good.  \n5. \nI checked out for the last time\non the first of May;\ngraduate of the mental cases,\nwith my analyst’s okay,\nmy complete book of rhymes,\nmy typewriter and my suitcases. \nAll that summer I learned life\nback into my own\nseven rooms, visited the swan boats,\nthe market, answered the phone,\nserved cocktails as a wife\nshould, made love among my petticoats \nand August tan. And you came each\nweekend. But I lie.\nYou seldom came. I just pretended\nyou, small piglet, butterfly\ngirl with jelly bean cheeks,\ndisobedient three, my splendid \nstranger. And I had to learn\nwhy I would rather\ndie than love, how your innocence\nwould hurt and how I gather\nguilt like a young intern\nhis symptoms, his certain evidence. \nThat October day we went\nto Gloucester the red hills\nreminded me of the dry red fur fox\ncoat I played in as a child; stock-still\nlike a bear or a tent,\nlike a great cave laughing or a red fur fox. \nWe drove past the hatchery,\nthe hut that sells bait,\npast Pigeon Cove, past the Yacht Club, past Squall’s\nHill, to the house that waits\nstill, on the top of the sea,\nand two portraits hung on the opposite walls.  \n6. \nIn north light, my smile is held in place,\nthe shadow marks my bone.\nWhat could I have been dreaming as I sat there,\nall of me waiting in the eyes, the zone\nof the smile, the young face,\nthe foxes’ snare. \nIn south light, her smile is held in place,\nher cheeks wilting like a dry\norchid; my mocking mirror, my overthrown\nlove, my first image. She eyes me from that face,\nthat stony head of death\nI had outgrown. \nThe artist caught us at the turning;\nwe smiled in our canvas home\nbefore we chose our foreknown separate ways.\nThe dry red fur fox coat was made for burning.\nI rot on the wall, my own\nDorian Gray. \nAnd this was the cave of the mirror,\nthat double woman who stares\nat herself, as if she were petrified\nin time — two ladies sitting in umber chairs.\nYou kissed your grandmother\nand she cried.  \n7. \nI could not get you back\nexcept for weekends. You came\neach time, clutching the picture of a rabbit\nthat I had sent you. For the last time I unpack\nyour things. We touch from habit.\nThe first visit you asked my name.\nNow you stay for good. I will forget\nhow we bumped away from each other like marionettes\non strings. It wasn’t the same\nas love, letting weekends contain\nus. You scrape your knee. You learn my name,\nwobbling up the sidewalk, calling and crying.\nYou call me mother and I remember my mother again,\nsomewhere in greater Boston, dying. \nI remember we named you Joyce\nso we could call you Joy.\nYou came like an awkward guest\nthat first time, all wrapped and moist\nand strange at my heavy breast.\nI needed you. I didn’t want a boy,\nonly a girl, a small milky mouse\nof a girl, already loved, already loud in the house\nof herself. We named you Joy.\nI, who was never quite sure\nabout being a girl, needed another\nlife, another image to remind me.\nAnd this was my worst guilt; you could not cure\nnor soothe it. I made you to find me.\n', '\nMy dear, it was a moment\nto clutch at for a moment\nso that you may believe in it\nand believing is the act of love, I think,\neven in the telling, wherever it went. \nIn the false New England forest\nwhere the misplanted Norwegian trees\nrefused to root, their thick synthetic\nroots barging out of the dirt to work on the air,\nwe held hands and walked on our knees.\nActually, there was no one there. \nFor forty years this experimental\nwoodland grew, shaft by shaft in perfect rows\nwhere its stub branches held and its spokes fell.\nIt was a place of parallel trees, their lives\nfiled out in exile where we walked too alien to know\nour sameness and how our sameness survives. \nOutside of us the village cars followed\nthe white line we had carefully walked\ntwo nights before toward our single beds.\nWe lay halfway up an ugly hill and if we fell\nit was here in the woods where the woods were caught\nin their dying and you held me well. \nAnd now I must dream the forest whole\nand your sweet hands, not once as frozen\nas those stopped trees, nor ruled, nor pale,\nnor leaving mine. Today, in my house, I see\nour house, its pillars a dim basement of men\nholding up their foreign ground for you and me. \nMy dear, it was a time,\nbutchered from time\nthat we must tell of quickly\nbefore we lose the sound of our own\nmouths calling mine, mine, mine.\n', '\nSomebody left this white T-shirt\nlike a hangman’s hood on the new parking meter—\nthe magic marks upon its back say: I QUIT METH 4-EVER. \nA declaration to the sky, whose angels all wear seagull wings\nswooping over this street with its torn scratch tickets\nand Big Gulp cups dropped by the curb. \nExtra large, it has been customized\nwith a pocketknife or a canine tooth\nto rough the armholes where my boobs wobble out\nas I roam these rooms lit by twilight’s bulb,\nfeeling half like Bette Davis in a wheelchair\nand half like that Hell’s Angels kingpin with the tracheotomy. \nDear reader, do you know that guy?\nI didn’t think so.

Iowa was covered by twenty-five hundred feet of ice. No one knows why the glaciers formed and spread, or why they eventually retreated.\n\nI blinked and you were gone.\n\nAs a boy, he loved the idea of the ice age. Lumbering woolly mammoths and giant sloths. Outside, a vast white edict erasing the landscape. Inside his head, cave paintings of bison leapt in the firelight, their horns spiraling upward, the tips smoking.\n\nMen on skis came to dig you out. Though they worked all night, they were too late.\n\nWaking every day the frost reasserts itself. Its relentlessness a tedium, a closure. The earth must have looked more familiar when all was water. We don’t recognize ourselves amidst this overwhelming winter: static that censors newscasts, cold that burns, incessant dripping as icicles perfect themselves. The night skies are a riot of Chinese silk: bolts of crimson and shadow-blue. The radio crackles faintly.\n\nMedical refuse litters the beaches, spews into the water from a backed up sewer under the pier. Bacteria cavort in the seawater. The weather’s gone haywire all over the globe. The more sensitive you are the earlier you’ll die. Just hold your breath a little longer, dear.\n\nOnce you start this medication, you can’t stop. Your life changes. You decide, based on a dearth of information, which force you want to submit to: nature, now less maternal than ever, or her idiot son—modern medicine.\n\nYou make an effort to find some grand design in this blindness. If you can’t see well enough anymore to edit your film, perhaps you can still do the music. You set an example.\n\nLemme outa here.\n\nAs a boy, before his mother found out and made him stop, he’d bury the frozen birds he found on the porch after big storms by warming the earth first with his father’s blowtorch.\n\nBeing human, we can’t help attempting to arrange events into patterns—the way a sick man sees faces in the stains on his bedroom ceiling. He names them. Months later, they all converse.\n\nThe men in the ice-covered radio station play cards and drink bourbon.\n\nWhat defense can one mount against an avalanche?\n\nSpotless beakers, pipettes, rows of small cages. Welcome to the lab. Here’s the chamber where we run preliminary screenings. Better don these gloves. Why not use two pair, like me? The new man on the night shift nods off over his work, with the radio playing. Its tinny strands of music enter his dream disguised as a dead friend’s hair. He had short coarse hair, like a terrier’s, pleasantly stiff to the touch. The lab is brightly lit to ward off the backwash of night. Under the table the research assistant’s feet twitch spasmodically in his sleep.\n\nA series of blurry black-and-white newsreels flickers on the screen. Martian canals overflow their banks. A lake in Africa exhales a cloud of poison gas, killing thousands of villagers on its shores. Venice sinks. Anchorage, Alaska, is leveled by earthquakes. Pompeii is breaded and fried by its volcano. The swamp swallows another sand bar, then coughs up a tiny island. Subzero temperatures paralyze Acapulco. There have been several ice ages, a female narrator intones. The most recent lasted 90,000 years. A timer goes off and the lab assistant jerks awake. In about the time it takes to drink a glass of water, he remembers where he is.\n\n“This is probably the last time I will write to you . . .”   \n\nThe rocks applaud. Summers turn short and cool.

Deafened, hears\nA Gettysburg of breakfast food explode\nAgainst the surd tympanum of the air.\nThe roads outside to No-and-Any Where\nTrigger all space-time to a zero Now.\nThe punctual goddess blossoms on his brow—\nPragmatic emblem of the daylit need. \n3. \nNow with his thought the rank and maundy world\n(That lost between quanta and mechanic wave\nAll pulp and passion sprawls around the globe).\nHe stiffens, as a hand informs a glove,\nAnd drags each lank potential into form.\nThus the hieratic arrow of his glance\nCreates St. Sebastian Avenue Street Place—\nAll of sublunary circumstance\nCrowds on the casual platform of his gaze. \n4. \nLike money sealed in a pneumatic tube\nHe whirls beneath the city’s stony floor\nTo where the cold coordinates of work\nAdvance their cross-hairs on the target hour.\nThere surplus value’s mathematic flower\n(All X squared Y squared like a tesseract\nOr ghostly dirigible) grows unseen\nAcross the lean dimension of in fact. \n5. \nGrows all unseen as Jason Quint pursues\nThe windy hazard of the Absolute\nThrough icy tundras, farther than the Horn,\nVaster than Asia in their wuthering snows.\nThe sweat of progress and humanity\nColors no litmus in those latitudes;\nIn a rustle of banknotes and casualty lists\nThe Bomb is shaken from the wrath-bearing tree. \n6. \nThe quitting whistle lofts a flag of truce,\nAnd all hope’s flutes and harpsichords compound\nThe lonely leisure. The Great Nocturnal Drift\nSets to its Deep. He walks the park. Profound\nUnease returns to Quint. The sleepy lathes\nOf hummingbirds machine the emerald\nOf garden silence which his feet confuse.\nThe statues hoist, on labyrinthine paths,\nThe mineral grandeur of a public smile. \n7. \nAnd the world goes blank, and heavy as a stone\nRolls into night. It is the human hour.\nImperfect. Lovers, food and politics\nCommand the air, and Jason Quint alone,\nClothed in abstraction, like a bush that burns\nIn the blind frequencies where none may pass,\nStalks through that only country of the poor—\nThe lamplit hour the quitting whistle mourns. \n8. \nImperfect. The stability of dextrous stars\nOffers him comfort, but their light is cold.\nA storm of sentiment, sudden as a cloud\nOf migrant birds, sings in his head.

On the banks of the Xenil the dark Spanish maiden Comes up with the fruit of the tangled vine laden; And the Creole of Cuba laughs out to behold Through orange-leaves shining the broad spheres of gold; Yet with dearer delight from his home in the North, On the fields of his harvest the Yankee looks forth, Where crook-necks are coiling and yellow fruit shines, And the sun of September melts down on his vines. Ah! on Thanksgiving day, when from East and from West, From North and from South come the pilgrim and guest, When the gray-haired New Englander sees round his board The old broken links of affection restored, When the care-wearied man seeks his mother once more, And the worn matron smiles where the girl smiled before, What moistens the lip and what brightens the eye? What calls back the past, like the rich Pumpkin pie? Oh, fruit loved of boyhood! the old days recalling, When wood-grapes were purpling and brown nuts were falling! When wild, ugly faces we carved in its skin, Glaring out through the dark with a candle within! When we laughed round the corn-heap, with hearts all in tune, Our chair a broad pumpkin,—our lantern the moon, Telling tales of the fairy who travelled like steam, In a pumpkin-shell coach, with two rats for her team! Then thanks for thy present! none sweeter or better E'er smoked from an oven or circled a platter! Fairer hands never wrought at a pastry more fine, Brighter eyes never watched o'er its baking, than thine! And the prayer, which my mouth is too full to express, Swells my heart that thy shadow may never be less, That the days of thy lot may be lengthened below, And the fame of thy worth like a pumpkin-vine grow, And thy life be as sweet, and its last sunset sky Golden-tinted and fair as thy own Pumpkin pie!\n", '\nno poem here\n', "\nSoon I shall take more\nI will get more light\nand I'll know what I think\nabout that \nDriving down Second Ave. in a car\nthe frieze of my hand\nlike a grandmother\ncaptured in an institution\nI know I'll never live here again etc.\nmany many long years ago\nMillions of peeps in the scrawl\nthe regular trees\nthe regular dog snort &\ndig.

When she heard his step, She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage To meet him in the doorway with the news And put him on his guard. ‘Silas is back.’She pushed him outward with her through the door And shut it after her. ‘Be kind,’ she said. She took the market things from Warren’s arms And set them on the porch, then drew him down To sit beside her on the wooden steps.  ‘When was I ever anything but kind to him? But I’ll not have the fellow back,’ he said. ‘I told him so last haying, didn’t I? If he left then, I said, that ended it. What good is he? Who else will harbor him At his age for the little he can do? What help he is there’s no depending on. Off he goes always when I need him most. He thinks he ought to earn a little pay, Enough at least to buy tobacco with, So he won’t have to beg and be beholden.“All right,” I say, “I can’t afford to pay Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.”“Someone else can.” “Then someone else will have to.”I shouldn’t mind his bettering himself If that was what it was. You can be certain, When he begins like that, there’s someone at him Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,— In haying time, when any help is scarce. In winter he comes back to us. I’m done.’  ‘Sh! not so loud: he’ll hear you,’ Mary said.  ‘I want him to: he’ll have to soon or late.’  ‘He’s worn out. He’s asleep beside the stove. When I came up from Rowe’s I found him here, Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep, A miserable sight, and frightening, too— You needn’t smile—I didn’t recognize him— I wasn’t looking for him—and he’s changed. Wait till you see.’                            ‘Where did you say he’d been?’  ‘He didn’t say. I dragged him to the house, And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke. I tried to make him talk about his travels. Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.’  ‘What did he say? Did he say anything?’  ‘But little.’                  ‘Anything? Mary, confess He said he’d come to ditch the meadow for me.’ ‘Warren!’                ‘But did he? I just want to know.’  ‘Of course he did. What would you have him say? Surely you wouldn’t grudge the poor old man Some humble way to save his self-respect. He added, if you really care to know, He meant to clear the upper pasture, too. That sounds like something you have heard before? Warren, I wish you could have heard the way He jumbled everything. I stopped to look Two or three times—he made me feel so queer— To see if he was talking in his sleep. He ran on Harold Wilson—you remember— The boy you had in haying four years since. He’s finished school, and teaching in his college. Silas declares you’ll have to get him back. He says they two will make a team for work: Between them they will lay this farm as smooth! The way he mixed that in with other things. He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft On education—you know how they fought All through July under the blazing sun, Silas up on the cart to build the load, Harold along beside to pitch it on.’  ‘Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.’  ‘Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream. You wouldn’t think they would. How some things linger! Harold’s young college boy’s assurance piqued him. After so many years he still keeps finding Good arguments he sees he might have used. I sympathize. I know just how it feels To think of the right thing to say too late. Harold’s associated in his mind with Latin. He asked me what I thought of Harold’s saying He studied Latin like the violin Because he liked it—that an argument! He said he couldn’t make the boy believe He could find water with a hazel prong— Which showed how much good school had ever done him. He wanted to go over that. But most of all He thinks if he could have another chance To teach him how to build a load of hay—’  ‘I know, that’s Silas’ one accomplishment. He bundles every forkful in its place, And tags and numbers it for future reference, So he can find and easily dislodge it In the unloading. Silas does that well. He takes it out in bunches like big birds’ nests. You never see him standing on the hay He’s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.’  ‘He thinks if he could teach him that, he’d be Some good perhaps to someone in the world. He hates to see a boy the fool of books. Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk, And nothing to look backward to with pride, And nothing to look forward to with hope, So now and never any different.’  Part of a moon was falling down the west, Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills. Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw itAnd spread her apron to it. She put out her hand Among the harp-like morning-glory strings, Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves, As if she played unheard some tenderness That wrought on him beside her in the night. ‘Warren,’ she said, ‘he has come home to die: You needn’t be afraid he’ll leave you this time.’  ‘Home,’ he mocked gently.                                         ‘Yes, what else but home? It all depends on what you mean by home. Of course he’s nothing to us, any more Than was the hound that came a stranger to us Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.’  ‘Home is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in.’                                        ‘I should have called it Something you somehow haven’t to deserve.’  Warren leaned out and took a step or two, Picked up a little stick, and brought it back And broke it in his hand and tossed it by. ‘Silas has better claim on us you think Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles As the road winds would bring him to his door. Silas has walked that far no doubt today. Why didn’t he go there? His brother’s rich, A somebody—director in the bank.’  ‘He never told us that.’                                    ‘We know it though.’  ‘I think his brother ought to help, of course. I’ll see to that if there is need. He ought of right To take him in, and might be willing to— He may be better than appearances. But have some pity on Silas. Do you think If he’d had any pride in claiming kin Or anything he looked for from his brother, He’d keep so still about him all this time?’  ‘I wonder what’s between them.’                                                  ‘I can tell you. Silas is what he is—we wouldn’t mind him— But just the kind that kinsfolk can’t abide. He never did a thing so very bad. He don’t know why he isn’t quite as good As anyone. Worthless though he is,He won’t be made ashamed to please his brother.’  ‘I can’t think Si ever hurt anyone.’  ‘No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back. He wouldn’t let me put him on the lounge. You must go in and see what you can do. I made the bed up for him there tonight. You’ll be surprised at him—how much he’s broken. His working days are done; I'm sure of it.’  ‘I’d not be in a hurry to say that.’  ‘I haven’t been. Go, look, see for yourself. But, Warren, please remember how it is: He’s come to help you ditch the meadow. He has a plan. You mustn’t laugh at him. He may not speak of it, and then he may. I’ll sit and see if that small sailing cloud Will hit or miss the moon.’                                        It hit the moon. Then there were three there, making a dim row, The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.

He asked with the eyes more than the lips    For a shelter for the night, And he turned and looked at the road afar    Without a window light. The bridegroom came forth into the porch    With, ‘Let us look at the sky, And question what of the night to be,    Stranger, you and I.’The woodbine leaves littered the yard,    The woodbine berries were blue, Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;    ‘Stranger, I wish I knew.’Within, the bride in the dusk alone    Bent over the open fire, Her face rose-red with the glowing coal    And the thought of the heart’s desire. The bridegroom looked at the weary road,    Yet saw but her within, And wished her heart in a case of gold    And pinned with a silver pin. The bridegroom thought it little to give    A dole of bread, a purse, A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God,    Or for the rich a curse; But whether or not a man was asked    To mar the love of two By harboring woe in the bridal house,    The bridegroom wished he knew.\n', '\nThere was never a sound beside the wood but one,And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound—And that was why it whispered and did not speak.It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weakTo the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.\n', '\nO hushed October morning mild,Thy leaves have ripened to the fall;Tomorrow’s wind, if it be wild,Should waste them all.The crows above the forest call;Tomorrow they may form and go.O hushed October morning mild,Begin the hours of this day slow.Make the day seem to us less brief.Hearts not averse to being beguiled,Beguile us in the way you know.Release one leaf at break of day;At noon release another leaf;One from our trees, one far away.Retard the sun with gentle mist;Enchant the land with amethyst.Slow, slow!For the grapes’ sake, if they were all,Whose leaves already are burnt with frost,Whose clustered fruit must else be lost—For the grapes’ sake along the wall.\n', '\nThe buzz saw snarled and rattled in the yardAnd made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.And from there those that lifted eyes could countFive mountain ranges one behind the otherUnder the sunset far into Vermont.And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,As it ran light, or had to bear a load.And nothing happened: day was all but done.Call it a day, I wish they might have saidTo please the boy by giving him the half hourThat a boy counts so much when saved from work.His sister stood beside him in her apronTo tell them ‘Supper.’ At the word, the saw,As if to prove saws knew what supper meant,Leaped out at the boy’s hand, or seemed to leap—He must have given the hand. However it was, Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!The boy’s first outcry was a rueful laugh,As he swung toward them holding up the handHalf in appeal, but half as if to keepThe life from spilling. Then the boy saw all—Since he was old enough to know, big boyDoing a man’s work, though a child at heart— He saw all spoiled. ‘Don’t let him cut my hand off—The doctor, when he comes. Don’t let him, sister!’So. But the hand was gone already.The doctor put him in the dark of ether.He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.And then—the watcher at his pulse took fright.No one believed. They listened at his heart.Little—less—nothing!—and that ended it. No more to build on there. And they, since theyWere not the one dead, turned to their affairs.\n', '\nI wonder about the trees.Why do we wish to bearForever the noise of theseMore than another noiseSo close to our dwelling place?We suffer them by the dayTill we lose all measure of pace,And fixity in our joys,And acquire a listening air.They are that that talks of goingBut never gets away;And that talks no less for knowing,As it grows wiser and older,That now it means to stay.My feet tug at the floorAnd my head sways to my shoulderSometimes when I watch trees sway,From the window or the door.I shall set forth for somewhere,I shall make the reckless choiceSome day when they are in voiceAnd tossing so as to scareThe white clouds over them on.I shall have less to say,But I shall be gone.\n', '\n\n\n\n“That God is colouring Newton doth shew”—William Blake\n\n\n\n          Erecting beyond the boundaries of all government his grand Station and Customs, I find what I have made there a Gate, a staking out of his art in Inconsequence.

The temple, sleek at the top, smiled with music—it might’ve lifted for a second.I was just there. The priests wore such tall hats, heavenly bodies dropped behind their eyes. The mothers of Jerusalem suggested curtains tattering down from the markets that whirred with the songs of bargaining, parting one from the other, laughing home.The dust lifted into the hair of the peaceful citizens and was shaken out. The land was socializing.

So, as I enter here from day to day,       And leave my burden at this minster gate,       Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray, The tumult of the time disconsolate       To inarticulate murmurs dies away,       While the eternal ages watch and wait.  II How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers!       This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves       Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves       Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers, And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!       But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves       Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,       And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers! Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain,       What exultations trampling on despair,       What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong, What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,       Uprose this poem of the earth and air,       This mediæval miracle of song!  I enter, and I see thee in the gloom       Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine!       And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine.       The air is filled with some unknown perfume; The congregation of the dead make room       For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine;       Like rooks that haunt Ravenna\'s groves of pine       The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb. From the confessionals I hear arise       Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies,       And lamentations from the crypts below; And then a voice celestial that begins       With the pathetic words, "Although your sins       As scarlet be," and ends with "as the snow."  With snow-white veil and garments as of flame,       She stands before thee, who so long ago       Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe       From which thy song and all its splendors came; And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name,       The ice about thy heart melts as the snow       On mountain heights, and in swift overflow       Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame. Thou makest full confession; and a gleam,       As of the dawn on some dark forest cast,       Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase; Lethe and Eunoë — the remembered dream       And the forgotten sorrow — bring at last       That perfect pardon which is perfect peace.  I lift mine eyes, and all the windows blaze       With forms of Saints and holy men who died,       Here martyred and hereafter glorified;       And the great Rose upon its leaves displays Christ\'s Triumph, and the angelic roundelays,       With splendor upon splendor multiplied;       And Beatrice again at Dante\'s side       No more rebukes, but smiles her words of praise. And then the organ sounds, and unseen choirs       Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love       And benedictions of the Holy Ghost; And the melodious bells among the spires       O\'er all the house-tops and through heaven above       Proclaim the elevation of the Host!  O star of morning and of liberty!       O bringer of the light, whose splendor shines       Above the darkness of the Apennines,       Forerunner of the day that is to be! The voices of the city and the sea,       The voices of the mountains and the pines,       Repeat thy song, till the familiar lines       Are footpaths for the thought of Italy! Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights,       Through all the nations, and a sound is heard,       As of a mighty wind, and men devout, Strangers of Rome, and the new proselytes,       In their own language hear thy wondrous word,       And many are amazed and many doubt. \n', '\n“Take me with you” my mother says standing in her nightgown as, home from college, I prepare to leave before dawn.

Helpe then, O holy Virgin chiefe of nine, Thy weaker Novice to performe thy will, Lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne The antique rolles, which there lye hidden still, Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill, Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long Sought through the world, and suffered so much ill, That I must rue his undeserved wrong: O helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull tong. And thou most dreaded impe of highest Jove, Faire Venus sonne, that with thy cruell dart At that good knight so cunningly didst rove, That glorious fire it kindled in his hart, Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart, And with thy mother milde come to mine ayde: Come both, and with you bring triumphant Mart, In loves and gentle jollities arrayd, After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd. And with them eke, O Goddesse heavenly bright, Mirrour of grace and Majestie divine, Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose light Like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine, Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne, And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile, To thinke of that true glorious type of thine, The argument of mine afflicted stile: The which to heare, vouchsafe, O dearest dred a-while.  i A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine, Y cladd in mightie armes and silver shielde, Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine, The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde; Yet armes till that time did he never wield: His angry steede did chide his foming bitt, As much disdayning to the curbe to yield: Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt, As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.  ii But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore, The deare remembrance of his dying Lord, For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore, And dead as living ever him ador'd: Upon his shield the like was also scor'd, For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had: Right faithfull true he was in deede and word, But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad; Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad.  iii Upon a great adventure he was bond, That greatest Gloriana to him gave, That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond, To winne him worship, and her grace to have, Which of all earthly things he most did crave; And ever as he rode, his hart did earne To prove his puissance in battell brave Upon his foe, and his new force to learne; Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.  iv A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside, Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow, Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide Under a vele, that wimpled was full low, And over all a blacke stole she did throw, As one that inly mournd: so was she sad, And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow; Seemed in heart some hidden care she had, And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.  v So pure an innocent, as that same lambe, She was in life and every vertuous lore, And by descent from Royall lynage came Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore, And all the world in their subjection held; Till that infernall feend with foule uprore Forwasted all their land, and them expeld: Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far compeld.  vi Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag, That lasie seemd in being ever last, Or wearied with bearing of her bag Of needments at his backe. Thus as they past, The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast, And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast, That every wight to shrowd it did constrain, And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain.  vii Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand, A shadie grove not far away they spide, That promist ayde the tempest to withstand: Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride, Did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide, Not perceable with power of any starre: And all within were pathes and alleies wide, With footing worne, and leading inward farre: Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.  viii And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led, Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony, Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred, Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky. Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy, The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall, The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar never dry, The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all, The Aspine good for staves, the Cypresse funerall.  ix The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still, The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours, The Eugh obedient to the benders will, The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill, The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound, The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill, The fruitfull Olive, and the Platane round, The carver Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.  x Led with delight, they thus beguile the way, Untill the blustring storme is overblowne; When weening to returne, whence they did stray, They cannot find that path, which first was showne, But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne, Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene, That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne: So many pathes, so many turnings seene, That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been.  xi At last resolving forward still to fare, Till that some end they finde or in or out, That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare, And like to lead the labyrinth about; Which when by tract they hunted had throughout, At length it brought them to a hollow cave, Amid the thickest woods. The Champion stout Eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave, And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave.  xii Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde, Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke: The danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde, Breeds dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke, And perill without show: therefore your stroke Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made. Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to revoke The forward footing for an hidden shade: Vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.  xiii Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place I better wot then you, though now too late To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace, Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate, To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate. This is the wandring wood, this Errours den, A monster vile, whom God and man does hate: Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth then The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for living men.  xiv But full of fire and greedy hardiment, The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide, But forth unto the darksome hole he went, And looked in: his glistring armor made A litle glooming light, much like a shade, By which he saw the ugly monster plaine, Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide, But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine, Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.  xv And as she lay upon the durtie ground, Her huge long taile her den all overspred, Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound, Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there bred A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed, Sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone Of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored: Soone as that uncouth light upon them shone, Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.  xvi Their dam upstart, out of her den effraide, And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile About her cursed head, whose folds displaid Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile. She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe; For light she hated as the deadly bale, Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine, Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.  xvii Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd, he lept As Lyon fierce upon the flying pray, And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept From turning backe, and forced her to stay: Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray, And turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst, Threatning her angry sting, him to dismay: Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst: The stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst.  xviii Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd, Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round, And all attonce her beastly body raizd With doubled forces high above the ground: Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd, Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine All suddenly about his body wound, That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine: God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine.  xix His Lady sad to see his sore constraint, Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee, Add faith unto your force, and be not faint: Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee. That when he heard, in great perplexitie, His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine, And knitting all his force got one hand free, Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine, That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.  xx Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw A floud of poyson horrible and blacke, Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw, Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe: Her vomit full of bookes and papers was, With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke, And creeping sought way in the weedy gras: Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.  xxi As when old father Nilus gins to swell With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale, His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell, And overflow each plaine and lowly dale: But when his later spring gins to avale, Huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male And partly female of his fruitfull seed; Such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed.  xxii The same so sore annoyed has the knight, That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke, His forces faile, ne can no longer fight. Whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke, She poured forth out of her hellish sinke Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small, Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke, Which swarming all about his legs did crall, And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.  xxiii As gentle Shepheard in sweete even-tide, When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west, High on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide, Markes which do byte their hasty supper best; A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest, All striving to infixe their feeble stings, That from their noyance he no where can rest, But with his clownish hands their tender wings He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.  xxiv Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame, Then of the certaine perill he stood in, Halfe furious unto his foe he came, Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win, Or soone to lose, before he once would lin; And strooke at her with more then manly force, That from her body full of filthie sin He raft her hatefull head without remorse; A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse.  xxv Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare They saw so rudely falling to the ground, Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare, Gathred themselves about her body round, Weening their wonted entrance to have found At her wide mouth: but being there withstood They flocked all about her bleeding wound, And sucked up their dying mothers blood, Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.  xxvi That detestable sight him much amazde, To see th'unkindly Impes of heaven accurst, Devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd, Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst, Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst, And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst; Now needeth him no lenger labour spend, His foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend.  xxvii His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre Approcht in hast to greet his victorie, And said, Faire knight, borne under happy starre, Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye: Well worthy be you of that Armorie, Wherein ye have great glory wonne this day, And proov'd your strength on a strong enimie, Your first adventure: many such I pray, And henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may.  xxviii Then mounted he upon his Steede againe, And with the Lady backward sought to wend; That path he kept, which beaten was most plame, Ne ever would to any by-way bend, But still did follow one unto the end, The which at last out of the wood them brought. So forward on his way (with God to frend) He passed forth, and new adventure sought; Long way he travelled, before he heard of ought.  xxix At length they chaunst to meet upon the way An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad, His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray, And by his belt his booke he hanging had; Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad, And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent, Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad, And all the way he prayed, as he went, And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.  xxx He faire the knight saluted, louting low, Who faire him quited, as that courteous was: And after asked him, if he did know Of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas. Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas, Silly old man, that lives in hidden cell, Bidding his beades all day for his trespas, Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell? With holy father sits not with such things to mell.  xxxi But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell, And homebred evill ye desire to heare, Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell, That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare. Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere, And shall you well reward to shew the place, In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare: For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace, That such a cursed creature lives so long a space.  xxxii Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse His dwelling is, by which no living wight May ever passe, but thorough great distresse. Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night, And well I wote, that of your later fight Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong, But wanting rest will also want of might? The Sunne that measures heaven all day long, At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waves emong.  xxxiii Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest, And with new day new worke at once begin: Untroubled night they say gives counsell best. Right well Sir knight ye have advised bin, (Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win Is wisely to advise: now day is spent; Therefore with me ye may take up your In For this same night. The knight was well content: So with that godly father to his home they went.  xxxiv A little lowly Hermitage it was, Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side, Far from resort of people, that did pas In travell to and froe: a little wyde There was an holy Chappell edifyde, Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say His holy things each morne and eventyde: Thereby a Christall streame did gently play, Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.  xxxv Arrived there, the little house they fill, Ne looke for entertainement, where none was: Rest is their feast, and all things at their will; The noblest mind the best contentment has. With faire discourse the evening so they pas: For that old man of pleasing wordes had store, And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas; He told of Saintes and Popes, and evermore He strowd an Ave-Mary after and before.  xxxvi The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast, And the sad humour loading their eye liddes, As messenger of Morpheus on them cast Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes. Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes: Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes, He to his study goes, and there amiddes His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes, He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes.  xxxvii Then choosing out few wordes most horrible, (Let none them read) thereof did verses frame, With which and other spelles like terrible, He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame, And cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame Of highest God, the Lord of life and light; A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night, At which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight.  xxxviii And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred Legions of Sprights, the which like little flyes Fluttring about his ever damned hed, A-waite whereto their service he applyes, To aide his friends, or fray his enimies: Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo, And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes; The one of them he gave a message too, The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.  xxxix He making speedy way through spersed ayre, And through the world of waters wide and peepe, To Morpheus house doth hastily repaire. Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe, And low, where dawning day doth never peepe, His dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed Doth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe In silver deaw his ever-drouping hed, Whiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred.  xl Whose double gates he findeth locked fast, The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory, The other all with silver overcast; And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye Watching to banish Care their enimy, Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe. By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly, And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.  xli And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft, A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe And ever-drizling raine upon the loft, Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne: No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes, As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne, Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes, Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.  xlii The messenger approching to him spake, But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine: So sound he slept, that nought mought him awake. Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine, Whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe Shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake. As one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine In tost with troubled sights and fancies weake, He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.  xliii The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake, And threatned unto him the dreaded name Of Hecate: whereat he gan to quake, And lifting up his lumpish head, with blame Halfe angry asked him, for what he came. Hither (quoth he) me Archimago sent, He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame, He bids thee to him send for his intent A fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.  xliv The God obayde, and calling forth straight way A diverse dreame out of his prison darke, Delivered it to him, and downe did lay His heavie head, devoide of carefull carke, Whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke. He backe returning by the Yvorie dore, Remounted up as light as chearefull Larke, And on his litle winges the dreame he bore In hast unto his Lord, where he him left afore.  xlv Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes, Had made a Lady of that other Spright, And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes So lively, and so like in all mens sight, That weaker sence it could have ravisht quight: The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt, Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight: Her all in white he clad, and over it Cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Una fit.  xlvi Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought, Unto that Elfin knight he bad him fly, Where he slept soundly void of evill thought And with false shewes abuse his fantasy, In sort as he him schooled privily: And that new creature borne without her dew, Full of the makers guile, with usage sly He taught to imitate that Lady trew, Whose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew.  xlvii Thus well instructed, to their worke they hast, And comming where the knight in slomber lay, The one upon his hardy head him plast, And made him dreame of loves and lustfull play, That nigh his manly hart did melt away, Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy: Then seemed him his Lady by him lay, And to him playnd, how that false winged boy, Her chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.  xlviii And she her selfe of beautie soveraigne Queene, Faire Venus seemde unto his bed to bring Her, whom he waking evermore did weene, To be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring On earthly braunch, the daughter of a king, Now a loose Leman to vile service bound: And eke the Graces seemed all to sing, Hymen {i}{_o} Hymen, dauncing all around, While freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd.  xlix In this great passion of unwonted lust, Or wonted feare of doing ought amis, He started up, as seeming to mistrust Some secret ill, or hidden foe of his: Lo there before his face his Lady is, Under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke, And as halfe blushing offred him to kis, With gentle blandishment and lovely looke, Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.  l All cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight, And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise, He thought have slaine her in his fierce despight: But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise, He stayde his hand, and gan himselfe advise To prove his sense, and tempt her faigned truth. Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise, Tho can she weepe, to stirre up gentle ruth, Both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth.  li And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my love, Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate, And mightie causes wrought in heaven above, Or the blind God, that doth me thus amate, For hoped love to winne me certaine hate? Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die. Die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state You, whom my hard avenging destinie Hath made judge of my life or death indifferently.  lii Your owne deare sake forst me at first to leave My Fathers kingdome, There she stopt with teares; Her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereave, And then againe begun, My weaker yeares Captiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares, Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde: Let me not dye in languor and long teares. Why Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd? What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?  liii Love of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint Lets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night In secret anguish and unpittied plaint, Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight. Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight Suspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he knew, Her fawning love with foule disdainefull spight He would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew, That for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you grew.  liv Assure your selfe, it fell not all to ground; For all so deare as life is to my hart, I deeme your love, and hold me to you bound; Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart, Where cause is none, but to your rest depart. Not all content, yet seemd she to appease Her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art, And fed with words, that could not chuse but please, So slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.  lv Long after lay he musing at her mood, Much griev'd to think that gentle Dame so light, For whose defence he was to shed his blood. At last dull wearinesse of former fight Having yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright, That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine, With bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight: But when he saw his labour all was vaine, With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe. \n", '\nI was conceived in the cruelest monthin whatever spring California could muster.A little rain—with some more likely.And the buckeyes were they yet on the ground?Damn my father’s smooth stone eyes,other prevailing enticements and what Eliot calledthe ', '\nAn old man with a new hat\nis running out of pride.\nI want to tell the truth\nbut I don’t know how.\nThe wind is our best pen\nand it blows poetry out of the water. \nI wait for days and weeks to enter\na feeling that’s had years to leave.\nThe ocean keeps throwing questions\nit has all the answers to.\nA candle lights a room\nand dims the stars. \nWhen all that consoled consoles no longer\nloneliness finds a room inside the one it knows.\nI am shrinking from the light\nand turning into space.\nAn old man with a new hat\nwears his smile in the dark.', '\nShe dances only in her necklace,scotch-lit surely.

II“Like rock or stone, it is o’ergrown,With lichens to the very top,And hung with heavy tufts of moss,A melancholy crop:Up from the earth these mosses creep,And this poor Thorn they clasp it roundSo close, you’d say that they are bentWith plain and manifest intentTo drag it to the ground;And all have joined in one endeavourTo bury this poor Thorn for ever.                             III“High on a mountain’s highest ridge,Where oft the stormy winter galeCuts like a scythe, while through the cloudsIt sweeps from vale to vale;Not five yards from the mountain path,This Thorn you on your left espy;And to the left, three yards beyond,You see a little muddy pondOf water—never dry,Though but of compass small, and bareTo thirsty suns and parching air.                             IV“And, close beside this aged Thorn,There is a fresh and lovely sight,A beauteous heap, a hill of moss,Just half a foot in height.All lovely colours there you see,All colours that were ever seen;And mossy network too is there,As if by hand of lady fairThe work had woven been;And cups, the darlings of the eye,So deep is their vermilion dye.                              V“Ah me! what lovely tints are thereOf olive green and scarlet bright,In spikes, in branches, and in stars,Green, red, and pearly white!This heap of earth o’ergrown with moss,Which close beside the Thorn you see,So fresh in all its beauteous dyes,Is like an infant’s grave in size,As like as like can be:But never, never any where,An infant’s grave was half so fair.                             VI“Now would you see this aged Thorn,This pond, and beauteous hill of moss,You must take care and choose your timeThe mountain when to cross.For oft there sits between the heap,So like an infant’s grave in size,And that same pond of which I spoke,A Woman in a scarlet cloak,And to herself she cries,‘\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!Oh woe is me! oh misery!’\ufeff                             VII“At all times of the day and nightThis wretched Woman thither goes;And she is known to every star,And every wind that blows;And there, beside the Thorn, she sitsWhen the blue daylight’s in the skies,And when the whirlwind’s on the hill,Or frosty air is keen and still,And to herself she cries,‘\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!Oh woe is me! oh misery!’ ”                            VIII“Now wherefore, thus, by day and night,In rain, in tempest, and in snow,Thus to the dreary mountain-topDoes this poor Woman go?And why sits she beside the ThornWhen the blue daylight’s in the skyOr when the whirlwind’s on the hill,Or frosty air is keen and still,And wherefore does she cry?—O wherefore? wherefore? tell me whyDoes she repeat that doleful cry?”                             IX“I cannot tell; I wish I could;For the true reason no one knows:But would you gladly view the spot,The spot to which she goes;The hillock like an infant’s grave,The pond—and Thorn, so old and grey;Pass by her door—’tis seldom shut—And if you see her in her hut—Then to the spot away!I never heard of such as dareApproach the spot when she is there.”                              X“But wherefore to the mountain-topCan this unhappy Woman go,Whatever star is in the skies,Whatever wind may blow?”“Full twenty years are past and goneSince she (her name is Martha Ray)Gave with a maiden’s true good-willHer company to Stephen Hill;And she was blithe and gay,While friends and kindred all approvedOf him whom tenderly she loved.                             XI“And they had fixed the wedding day,The morning that must wed them both;But Stephen to another MaidHad sworn another oath;And, with this other Maid, to churchUnthinking Stephen went— Poor Martha! on that woeful dayA pang of pitiless dismayInto her soul was sent;A fire was kindled in her breast,Which might not burn itself to rest.                             XII“They say, full six months after this,While yet the summer leaves were green,She to the mountain-top would go,And there was often seen.What could she seek?—or wish to hide?Her state to any eye was plain;She was with child, and she was mad;Yet often was she sober sadFrom her exceeding pain.O guilty Father—would that deathHad saved him from that breach of faith!                            XIII“Sad case for such a brain to holdCommunion with a stirring child!Sad case, as you may think, for oneWho had a brain so wild!Last Christmas-eve we talked of this,And grey-haired Wilfred of the glenHeld that the unborn infant wroughtAbout its mother’s heart, and broughtHer senses back again:And, when at last her time drew near,Her looks were calm, her senses clear.                             XIV“More know I not, I wish I did,And it should all be told to you;For what became of this poor childNo mortal ever knew;Nay—if a child to her was bornNo earthly tongue could ever tell;And if ’twas born alive or dead,Far less could this with proof be said;But some remember well,That Martha Ray about this timeWould up the mountain often climb.                             XV“And all that winter, when at nightThe wind blew from the mountain-peak,’Twas worth your while, though in the dark,The churchyard path to seek:For many a time and oft were heardCries coming from the mountain head:Some plainly living voices were;And others, I’ve heard many swear,Were voices of the dead:I cannot think, whate’er they say,They had to do with Martha Ray.                             XVI“But that she goes to this old Thorn,The Thorn which I described to you,And there sits in a scarlet cloak,I will be sworn is true.For one day with my telescope,To view the ocean wide and bright,When to this country first I came,Ere I had heard of Martha’s name,I climbed the mountain’s height:—A storm came on, and I could seeNo object higher than my knee.                            XVII“ ’Twas mist and rain, and storm and rain:No screen, no fence could I discover;And then the wind! in sooth, it wasA wind full ten times over.I looked around, I thought I sawA jutting crag,—and off I ran,Head-foremost, through the driving rain,The shelter of the crag to gain;And, as I am a man,Instead of jutting crag, I foundA Woman seated on the ground.                            XVIII“I did not speak—I saw her face;Her face!—it was enough for me;I turned about and heard her cry,‘\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!’\ufeffAnd there she sits, until the moonThrough half the clear blue sky will go;And when the little breezes makeThe waters of the pond to shake,As all the country know,She shudders, and you hear her cry,‘\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!’ ”                             XIX“But what’s the Thorn? and what the pond?And what the hill of moss to her?And what the creeping breeze that comesThe little pond to stir?”“I cannot tell; but some will sayShe hanged her baby on the tree;Some say she drowned it in the pond,Which is a little step beyond:But all and each agree,The little Babe was buried there,Beneath that hill of moss so fair.                             XX“I’ve heard, the moss is spotted redWith drops of that poor infant’s blood;But kill a new-born infant thus,I do not think she could!Some say, if to the pond you go,And fix on it a steady view,The shadow of a babe you trace,A baby and a baby’s face,And that it looks at you;Whene’er you look on it, ’tis plainThe baby looks at you again.                             XXI“And some had sworn an oath that sheShould be to public justice brought;And for the little infant’s bonesWith spades they would have sought.But instantly the hill of mossBefore their eyes began to stir!And, for full fifty yards around,The grass—it shook upon the ground!Yet all do still averThe little Babe lies buried there,Beneath that hill of moss so fair.                            XXII“I cannot tell how this may be,But plain it is the Thorn is boundWith heavy tufts of moss that striveTo drag it to the ground;And this I know, full many a time,When she was on the mountain high,By day, and in the silent night,When all the stars shone clear and bright,That I have heard her cry,‘\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!Oh woe is me! oh misery!’ ”\n", '\n\n\n\n‘They toil not, neither do they spin.’\n\n\n\nOne morn before me were three figures seen,     With bowèd necks, and joinèd hands, side-faced; And one behind the other stepp’d serene,     In placid sandals, and in white robes graced;         They pass’d, like figures on a marble urn,     When shifted round to see the other side; They came again; as when the urn once more         Is shifted round, the first seen shades return;     And they were strange to me, as may betide With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore.How is it, Shadows! that I knew ye not?     How came ye muffled in so hush a mask? Was it a silent deep-disguisèd plot     To steal away, and leave without a task         My idle days? Ripe was the drowsy hour;     The blissful cloud of summer-indolence Benumb’d my eyes; my pulse grew less and less;         Pain had no sting, and pleasure’s wreath no flower:     O, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense Unhaunted quite of all but—nothingness?A third time pass’d they by, and, passing, turn’d     Each one the face a moment whiles to me; Then faded, and to follow them I burn’d     And ached for wings, because I knew the three;         The first was a fair Maid, and Love her name;     The second was Ambition, pale of cheek, And ever watchful with fatiguèd eye;         The last, whom I love more, the more of blame     Is heap’d upon her, maiden most unmeek,— I knew to be my demon Poesy.They faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings:     O folly! What is Love? and where is it? And for that poor Ambition! it springs     From a man’s little heart’s short fever-fit;         For Poesy!—no,—she has not a joy,—     At least for me,—so sweet as drowsy noons, And evenings steep’d in honey’d indolence;         O, for an age so shelter’d from annoy,     That I may never know how change the moons, Or hear the voice of busy common-sense! And once more came they by:—alas! wherefore?      My sleep had been embroider’d with dim dreams;  My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o’er      With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams:         The morn was clouded, but no shower fell,      Tho’ in her lids hung the sweet tears of May; The open casement press’d a new-leaved vine,      Let in the budding warmth and throstle’s lay;         O Shadows! ’twas a time to bid farewell! Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine. So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise     My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass; For I would not be dieted with praise,     A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce!         Fade softly from my eyes, and be once more     In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn; Farewell!

Why should we be organized to defend the kingdom\nOf dullness? There are so many slimy people connected with poetry,\nToo, and people who know nothing about it!\nI am not recommending that poets like each other and organize to fight them,\nBut simply that lightning should strike them.”\nThen the assembled mediocrities shot arrows at the blond-haired man.\nThe chairman stood up on the platform, oh he was physically ugly!\nHe was small-limbed and –boned and thought he was quite seductive,\nBut he was bald with certain hideous black hairs,\nAnd his voice had the sound of water leaving a vaseline bathtub,\nAnd he said, “The subject for this evening’s discussion is poetry\nOn the subject of love between swans.” And everyone threw candy hearts\nAt the disgusting man, and they stuck to his bib and tucker,\nAnd he danced up and down on the platform in terrific glee\nAnd recited the poetry of his little friends—but the blond man stuck his head\nOut of a cloud and recited poems about the east and thunder,\nAnd the black-haired man moved through the stratosphere chanting\nPoems of the relationships between terrific prehistoric charcoal whales,\nAnd the slimy man with candy hearts sticking all over him\nWilted away like a cigarette paper on which the bumblebees have urinated,\nAnd all the professors left the room to go back to their duty,\nAnd all that were left in the room were five or six poets\nAnd together they sang the new poem of the twentieth century\nWhich, though influenced by Mallarmé, Shelley, Byron, and Whitman,\nPlus a million other poets, is still entirely original\nAnd is so exciting that it cannot be here repeated.\nYou must go to the Poem Society and wait for it to happen.\nOnce you have heard this poem you will not love any other,\nOnce you have dreamed this dream you will be inconsolable,\nOnce you have loved this dream you will be as one dead,\nOnce you have visited the passages of this time’s great art!  \n                                                      2 \n“Oh to be seventeen years old\nOnce again,” sang the red-haired man, “and not know that poetry\nIs ruled with the sceptre of the dumb, the deaf, and the creepy!”\nAnd the shouting persons battered his immortal body with stones\nAnd threw his primitive comedy into the sea\nFrom which it sang forth poems irrevocably blue.\n \nWho are the great poets of our time, and what are their names?\nYeats of the baleful influence, Auden of the baleful influence, Eliot of the baleful influence\n(Is Eliot a great poet? no one knows), Hardy, Stevens, Williams (is Hardy of our time?),\nHopkins (is Hopkins of our time?), Rilke (is Rilke of our time?), Lorca (is Lorca of our time?), who is still of our time?\nMallarmé, Valéry, Apollinaire, Éluard, Reverdy, French poets are still of our time,\nPasternak and Mayakovsky, is Jouve of our time?\n \nWhere are young poets in America, they are trembling in publishing houses and universities,\nAbove all they are trembling in universities, they are bathing the library steps with their spit,\nThey are gargling out innocuous (to whom?) poems about maple trees and their children,\nSometimes they brave a subject like the Villa d’Este or a lighthouse in Rhode Island,\nOh what worms they are! they wish to perfect their form.\nYet could not these young men, put in another profession,\nSucceed admirably, say at sailing a ship? I do not doubt it, Sir, and I wish we could try them.\n(A plane flies over the ship holding a bomb but perhaps it will not drop the bomb,\nThe young poets from the universities are staring anxiously at the skies,\nOh they are remembering their days on the campus when they looked up to watch birds excrete,\nThey are remembering the days they spent making their elegant poems.)\n \nIs there no voice to cry out from the wind and say what it is like to be the wind,\nTo be roughed up by the trees and to bring music from the scattered houses\nAnd the stones, and to be in such intimate relationship with the sea\nThat you cannot understand it?

Madeleine Reierbacher says,\n“If you are happy, there is no one to keep you from being happy;\nDon’t let them!” Madeleine Reierbacher went into the racing car.\nThe racing car was orange and red. Madeleine Reierbacher drove to Beale Street.\nThere Maddy doffed her garments to get into some more comfortable clothes.\nJazz was already playing in Beale Street when Madeleine Reierbacher arrived there.\nMadeleine Reierbacher picked up the yellow horn and began to play.\nNo one had ever heard anything comparable to the playing of Madeleine Reierbacher.\nWhat a jazz musician! The pianist missed his beats because he was so excited.\nThe drummer stared out the window in ecstasy at the yellow wooden trees.\nThe orchestra played “September in the Rain,” “Mugging,” and “I’m Full of Love.”\nMadeleine Reierbacher rolled up her sleeves; she picked up her horn; she played “Blues in the Rain.”\nIt was the best jazz anyone had ever heard. It was mentioned in the newspapers. St. Louis!\nMadeleine Reierbacher became a celebrity. She played with Pesky Summerton and Muggsy Pierce.\nMadeleine cut numerous disks. Her best waxings are “Alpha Beta and Gamma”\nAnd “Wing Song.” One day Madeleine was riding on a donkey\nWhen she came to a yellow light; the yellow light did not change.\nMadeleine kept hoping it would change to green or red. She said, “As long as you have confidence,\nYou need be afraid of nothing.” Madeleine saw the red smokestacks, she looked at the thin trees,\nAnd she regarded the railroad tracks. The yellow light was unchanging. Madeleine’s donkey dropped dead\nFrom his mortal load. Madeleine Reierbacher, when she fell to earth,\nPicked up a blade of grass and began to play. “The Blues!” cried the workmen of the vicinity,\nAnd they ran and came in great numbers to where Madeleine Reierbacher was.\nThey saw her standing in that simple field beside the railroad track\nPlaying, and they saw that light changing to green and red, and they saw that donkey stand up\nAnd rise into the sky; and Madeleine Reierbacher was like a clot of blue\nIn the midst of the blue of all that sky, and the young farmers screamed\nIn excitement, and the workmen dropped their heavy boards and stones in their excitement,\nAnd they cried, “O Madeleine Reierbacher, play us the ‘Lead Flint Blues’ once again!” \nO railroad stations, pennants, evenings, and lumberyards!\nWhen will you ever bring us such a beautiful soloist again?\nAn argent strain shows on the reddish face of the sun.\nMadeleine Reierbacher stands up and screams, “I am getting wet!

Come back and sing to us!  \n                                                      2 \nDick looked up from his blackboard.\nHad he really written a history of the jazz age?\nHe stared at his television set; the technicolor jazz program was coming on.\nThe program that day was devoted to pictures of Madeleine Reierbacher\nPlaying her saxophone in the golden age of jazz.\nDick looked at his blackboard. It was a mass of green and orange lines.\nHere and there a red chalk line interlaced with the others.\nHe stared attentively at the program. \nIt was a clear and blue white day. Amos said, “The calibration is finished. Now there need be no more jazz.” \nIn his mountain home old Lucas Dog laughed when he heard what Amos had said.\nHe smilingly picked up his yellow horn to play, but all that came out of it was steam.\n', '\n\n                                           I \nO what a physical effect it has on me\nTo dive forever into the light blue sea\nOf your acquaintance!

They love me so much, he thought, they have imagined me dead because they fear the loss of my genius above all else. So he put on his hat, combed his goatee to a waxed point, and sauntered out of his flat to attend his own funeral. How literary, he thought, like Huck Finn, and Everyone will be weeping.\n       He was perturbed, however, when he found that the funeral home was in a bad section of town, next to a tattoo parlor named The Desultory Slut. He walked in past the unmanned front desk, to a back room of frayed velvet and gilt columns, where his coffin was on display, a faux mahogany monstrosity with painted pewter handles. The only people in attendance were four young professors from the local college, with leather patches on the elbows of their ill-fitting tweed jackets and long cruel faces of foxes and rats. He recognized one of them, a gangly fellow with pimply cheeks who had shaken his hand after his last reading and reverently asked for his signature.\n       Do you have one of my books to sign? the author had asked.\n       Oh no, the young professor had cried, baring his hairless chest, can you please sign here?\n       Now the pimply fellow was sitting in a pew, whispering loudly to his neighbor, Isn’t it great, he said, The old bastard finally kicked.\n       His neighbor nodded silently.\n       Deeply disturbed, but well aware of the dramatic potential of the moment, the author took this as his cue to step boldly into the room, with a loud Ta daaa!\n       For some reason, the professors ignored him, and continued their whispering.\n       For a moment, he was afflicted with a strange vertigo, and stood like a clay golem, without a will of his own. Then a sudden rage took him, and the author snapped out of the spell and strode to the front of the room, waving his arms. Wait, I’m not dead at all. Here I am. It was all a mistake, he cried.\n       But the professors did not see him. In fact one walked right through him, as if he were merely a ghost or spirit, and rushed up to the coffin. Do you realize what this means? the professor cried, This means we’re free, and he grabbed the body in the coffin and dragged it to the floor. The shocked author saw in the body his own likeness, lips and cheeks rouged into a grotesque semblance of life.\n       He’s dead, he’s dead.

How oft upon yon eminence our pace Has slacken’d to a pause, and we have borne The ruffling wind, scarce conscious that it blew, While admiration, feeding at the eye, And still unsated, dwelt upon the scene. Thence with what pleasure have we just discern’d The distant plough slow-moving, and beside His lab’ring team, that swerv’d not from the track, The sturdy swain diminish’d to a boy! Here Ouse, slow winding through a level plain Of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o’er, Conducts the eye along its sinuous course Delighted.  There, fast rooted in his bank, Stand, never overlook’d, our fav’rite elms, That screen the herdsman’s solitary hut; While far beyond, and overthwart the stream That as with molten glass inlays the vale, The sloping land recedes into the clouds; Displaying on its varied side the grace Of hedge-row beauties numberless, square tow’r, Tall spire, from which the sound of cheerful bells Just undulates upon the list’ning ear, Groves, heaths, and smoking villages remote. Scenes must be beautiful which daily view’d Please daily, and whose novelty survives Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years. Praise justly due to those that I describe.  . . .   But though true worth and virtue, in the mild And genial soil of cultivated life Thrive most, and may perhaps thrive only there, Yet not in cities oft.  In proud and gay And gain-devoted cities; thither flow, As to a common and most noisome sewer, The dregs and fæculence of ev’ry land. In cities foul example on most minds Begets its likeness.  Rank abundance breeds In gross and pamper’d cities sloth and lust, And wantonness and gluttonous excess. In cities, vice is hidden with most ease, Or seen with least reproach; and virtue, taught By frequent lapse, can hope no triumph there Beyond th’ atchievement of successful flight. I do confess them nurs’ries of the arts, In which they flourish most: where, in the beams Of warm encouragement, and in the eye Of public note, they reach their perfect size. Such London is, by taste and wealth proclaim’d The fairest capital of all the world, By riot and incontinence the worst. There, touch’d by Reynolds, a dull blank becomes A lucid mirror, in which Nature sees All her reflected features.  Bacon there Gives more than female beauty to a stone, And Chatham’s eloquence to marble lips.  . . .   God made the country, and man made the town: What wonder then, that health and virtue, gifts That can alone make sweet the bitter draught That life holds out to all, should most abound And least be threaten’d in the fields and groves? Possess ye therefore, ye who, borne about In chariots and sedans, know no fatigue But that of idleness, and taste no scenes But such as art contrives, possess ye still Your element; there only ye can shine, There only minds like yours can do no harm. Our groves were planted to console at noon The pensive wand’rer in their shades.  At eve The moon-beam, sliding softly in between The sleeping leaves, is all the light they wish, Birds warbling all the music.  We can spare The splendour of your lamps, they but eclipse Our softer satellite. Your songs confound Our more harmonious notes: the thrush departs Scar’d, and th’ offended nightingale is mute. There is a public mischief in your mirth, It plagues your country.  Folly such as your’s, Grac’d with a sword, and worthier of a fan, Has made, which enemies could ne’er have done, Our arch of empire, steadfast but for you, A mutilated structure, soon to fall.\n', '\n\n\n\n(excerpt)\n\n\n\nEngland, with all thy faults, I love thee stillMy country! and while yet a nook is left Where English minds and manners may be found, Shall be constrain’d to love thee.  Though thy clime Be fickle, and thy year, most part, deform’d With dripping rains, or wither’d by a frost, I would not yet exchange thy sullen skies And fields without a flow’r, for warmer France With all her vines; nor for Ausonia’s groves Of golden fruitage and her myrtle bow’rs. To shake thy senate, and from heights sublime Of patriot eloquence to flash down fire Upon thy foes, was never meant my task: But I can feel thy fortunes, and partake Thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart As any thund’rer there.  And I can feel Thy follies too, and with a just disdain Frown at effeminates, whose very looks Reflect dishonour on the land I love. How, in the name of soldiership and sense, Should England prosper, when such things, as smooth And tender as a girl, all essenc’d o’er With odors, and as profligate as sweet, Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath, And love when they should fight; when such as these Presume to lay their hand upon the ark Of her magnificent and awful cause? Time was when it was praise and boast enough In ev’ry clime, and travel where we might, That we were born her children.  Praise enough To fill th’ ambition of a private man, That Chatham’s language was his mother tongue, And Wolfe’s great name compatriot with his own. Farewell those honors, and farewell with them The hope of such hereafter!  They have fall’n Each in his field of glory: one in arms, And one in council.  Wolfe upon the lap Of smiling victory that moment won, And Chatham, heart-sick of his country’s shame. They made us many soldiers.  Chatham still Consulting England’s happiness at home, Secur’d it by an unforgiving frown If any wrong’d her.  Wolfe, where’er he fought, Put so much of his heart into his act, That his example had a magnet’s force, And all were swift to follow whom all loved. Those suns are set.  Oh rise some other such! Or all that we have left is empty talk Of old achievements, and despair of new. . . .    There is a pleasure in poetic pains Which only poets know.  The shifts and turns, Th’ expedients and inventions multiform To which the mind resorts, in chase of terms Thought apt, yet coy, and difficult to win— T’ arrest the fleeting images that fill The mirror of the mind, and hold them fast, And force them sit, ’till he has pencill’d off A faithful likeness of the forms he views; Then to dispose his copies with such art That each may find its most propitious light, And shine by situation, hardly less, Than by the labor and the skill it cost, Are occupations of the poet’s mind So pleasing, and that steal away the thought With such address from themes of sad import, That lost in his own musings, happy man! He feels th’ anxieties of life, denied Their wonted entertainment, all retire. Such joys has he that sings.  But ah! not such, Or seldom such, the hearers of his song. Fastidious, or else listless, or perhaps Aware of nothing arduous in a task They never undertook, they little note His dangers or escapes, and haply find There least amusement where he found the most. But is amusement all?  studious of song, And yet ambitious not to sing in vain, I would not trifle merely, though the world Be loudest in their praise who do no more. Yet what can satire, whether grave or gay? It may correct a foible, may chastise The freaks of fashion, regulate the dress, Retrench a sword-blade, or displace a patch; But where are its sublimer trophies found? What vice has it subdu’d? whose heart reclaim’d By rigour, or whom laugh’d into reform? Alas! Leviathan is not so tam’d:Laugh’d at, he laughs again; and, stricken hard, Turns to the stroke his adamantine scales, That fear no discipline of human hands.   The pulpit, therefore (and I name it, fill’d With solemn awe, that bids me well beware With what intent I touch that holy thing)The pulpit (when the sat’rist has at last, Strutting and vap’ring in an empty school, Spent all his force and made no proselyte) I say the pulpit (in the sober use Of its legitimate, peculiar pow’rs) Must stand acknowledg’d, while the world shall stand, The most important and effectual guard, Support and ornament of virtue’s cause.\n', '\n\n\n\n(excerpt)\n\n\n\nHark! ’tis the twanging horn! o’er yonder bridge,That with its wearisome but needful length Bestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright; He comes, the herald of a noisy world, With spatter’d boots, strapp’d waist, and frozen locks, News from all nations lumb’ring at his back. True to his charge, the close-pack’d load behind, Yet careless what he brings, his one concern Is to conduct it to the destin’d inn: And having dropp’d th’ expected bag—pass on. He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch, Cold and yet cheerful: messenger of grief Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some, To him indiff’rent whether grief or joy. Houses in ashes, and the fall of stocks, Births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet With tears, that trickled down the writer’s cheeks, Fast as the periods from his fluent quill, Or charg’d with am’rous sighs of absent swains, Or nymphs responsive, equally affect His horse and him, unconscious of them all. But oh th’ important budget! usher’d in With such heart-shaking music, who can say What are its tidings? have our troops awak’d? Or do they still, as if with opium drugg’d, Snore to the murmurs of th’ Atlantic wave? Is India free? and does she wear her plum’d And jewell’d turban with a smile of peace, Or do we grind her still? The grand debate, The popular harangue, the tart reply, The logic, and the wisdom, and the wit, And the loud laugh—I long to know them all; I burn to set th’ imprison’d wranglers free, And give them voice and utt’rance once again.   Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast, Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round, And, while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn Throws up a steamy column, and the cups, That cheer but not inebriate, wait on each, So let us welcome peaceful ev’ning in. Not such his ev’ning, who with shining face Sweats in the crowded theatre, and squeez’d And bor’d with elbow-points through both his sides, Out-scolds the ranting actor on the stage: Nor his, who patient stands till his feet throb, And his head thumps, to feed upon the breath Of patriots, bursting with heroic rage, Or placemen, all tranquility and smiles. This folio of four pages, happy work! Which not ev’n critics criticise; that holds Inquisitive attention, while I read, Fast bound in chains of silence, which the fair, Though eloquent themselves, yet fear to break; What is it but a map of busy life, Its fluctuations, and its vast concerns? . . .    Oh Winter! ruler of th’ inverted year, Thy scatter’d hair with sleet like ashes fill’d, Thy breath congeal’d upon thy lips, thy cheeks Fring’d with a beard made white with other snows Than those of age; thy forehead wrapt in clouds, A leafless branch thy sceptre, and thy throne A sliding car, indebted to no wheels, But urg’d by storms along its slipp’ry way;I love thee, all unlovely as thou seem’st, And dreaded as thou art!  Thou hold’st the sun A pris’ner in the yet undawning East, Short’ning his journey between morn and noon, And hurrying him, impatient of his stay, Down to the rosy West; but kindly still Compensating his loss with added hours Of social converse and instructive ease, And gathering at short notice, in one group, The family dispers’d, and fixing thought, Not less dispers’d by day-light and its cares. I crown thee King of intimate delights, Fire-side enjoyments, home-born happiness, And all the comforts that the lowly roof Of undisturb’d retirement, and the hours Of long uninterrupted evening, know. No ratt’ling wheels stop short before these gates; No powder’d pert proficient in the art Of sounding an alarm, assaults these doors Till the street rings; no stationary steeds Cough their own knell, while, heedless of the sound, The silent circle fan themselves, and quake: But here the needle plies its busy task, The pattern grows, the well-depicted flow’r,Wrought patiently into the snowy lawn, Unfolds its bosom; buds, and leaves, and sprigs, And curling tendrils, gracefully dispos’d, Follow the nimble finger of the fair; A wreath that cannot fade, or flow’rs that blow With most success when all besides decay. The poet’s or historian’s page, by one Made vocal for th’ amusement of the rest; The sprightly lyre, whose treasure of sweet sounds The touch from many a trembling chord shakes out; And the clear voice symphonious, yet distinct, And in the charming strife triumphant still, Beguile the night, and set a keener edge On female industry; the threaded steel Flies swiftly, and unfelt the task proceeds. The volume clos’d, the customary rites Of the last meal commence.  A Roman meal; Such as the mistress of the world once found Delicious, when her patriots of high note, Perhaps by moonlight, at their humble doors, And under an old oak’s domestic shade, Enjoy’d, spare feast! a radish and an egg. Discourse ensues, not trivial, yet not dull, Nor such as with a frown forbids the play Of fancy, or proscribes the sound of mirth: Nor do we madly, like an impious world, Who deem religion frenzy, and the God That made them an intruder on their joys, Start at his awful name, or deem his praise A jarring note.  Themes of a graver tone, Exciting oft our gratitude and love, While we retrace with mem’ry’s pointing wand, That calls the past to our exact review, The dangers we have ’scap’d, the broken snare, The disappointed foe, deliv’rance found Unlook’d for, life preserv’d and peace restor’d, Fruits of omnipotent eternal love. Oh ev’nings worthy of the Gods! exclaim’d The Sabine bard.  Oh ev’nings, I reply, More to be priz’d and coveted than yours, As more illumin’d, and with nobler truths, That I and mine, and those we love, enjoy.\n', '\n\n\n\n(excerpt)\n\n\n\n’Tis morning; and the sun with ruddy orb Ascending, fires the horizon: while the clouds That crowd away before the driving wind, More ardent as the disk emerges more, Resemble most some city in a blaze, Seen through the leafless wood.  His slanting ray Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale, And tinging all with his own rosy hue, From ev’ry herb and ev’ry spiry blade Stretches a length of shadow o’er the field. Mine, spindling into longitude immense, In spite of gravity, and sage remark That I myself am but a fleeting shade, Provokes me to a smile.  With eye askance I view the muscular proportion’d limb Transform’d to a lean shank.  The shapeless pair, As they design’d to mock me, at my side Take step for step; and as I near approach The cottage, walk along the plaster’d wall, Prepost’rous sight! the legs without the man. The verdure of the plain lies buried deep Beneath the dazzling deluge; and the bents, And coarser grass upspearing o’er the rest, Of late unsightly and unseen, now shine Conspicuous, and in bright apparel clad, And fledg’d with icy feathers, nod superb. The cattle mourn in corners where the fence Screens them, and seem half petrified to sleep In unrecumbent sadness.  There they wait Their wonted fodder; not like hung’ring man Fretful if unsupply’d, but silent, meek, And patient of the slow-pac’d swain’s delay. He from the stack carves out th’ accustom’d load, Deep-plunging, and again deep plunging oft His broad keen knife into the solid mass; Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands, With such undeviating and even force He severs it away: no needless care Lest storms should overset the leaning pile Deciduous, or its own unbalanc’d weight.  . . .   ’Tis liberty alone that gives the flow’r Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume, And we are weeds without it.  All constraint, Except what wisdom lays on evil men, Is evil; hurts the faculties, impedes Their progress in the road of science; blinds The eyesight of discov’ry, and begets, In those that suffer it, a sordid mind Bestial, a meagre intellect, unfit To be the tenant of man’s noble form. Thee therefore still, blame-worthy as thou art, With all thy loss of empire, and though squeez’d By public exigence till annual food Fails for the craving hunger of the state, Thee I account still happy, and the chief Among the nations, seeing thou art free! My native nook of earth! . . .     But there is yet a liberty unsung By poets, and by senators unprais’d, Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the powers Of earth and hell confed’rate take away. A liberty, which persecution, fraud, Oppression, prisons, have no pow’r to bind, Which whoso tastes can be enslav’d no more. ’Tis liberty of heart, deriv’d from heav’n, Bought with HIS blood who gave it to mankind, And seal’d with the same token.  It is held By charter, and that charter sanction’d sure By th’ unimpeachable and awful oath And promise of a God.  His other gifts All bear the royal stamp that speaks them his, And are august, but this transcends them all. \n', '\n\n\n\n(excerpt)\n\n\n\nThus heav’n-ward all things tend. For all were once Perfect, and all must be at length restor’d. So God has greatly purpos’d; who would else In his dishonour’d works himself endure Dishonour, and be wrong’d without redress. Haste then, and wheel away a shatter’d world, Ye slow-revolving seasons! we would see, (A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet) A world that does not dread and hate his laws, And suffer for its crime; would learn how fair The creature is that God pronounces good, How pleasant in itself what pleases him. Here ev’ry drop of honey hides a sting, Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flow’rs, And ev’n the joy that haply some poor heart Derives from heav’n, pure as the fountain Is sully’d in the stream; taking a taint From touch of human lips, at best impure. Oh for a world in principle as chaste As this is gross and selfish! over which Custom and prejudice shall bear no sway, That govern all things here, should’ring aside The meek and modest truth, and forcing her To seek a refuge from the tongue of strife In nooks obscure, far from the ways of men: Where violence shall never lift the sword, Nor cunning justify the proud man’s wrong, Leaving the poor no remedy but tears: Where he that fills an office, shall esteem Th’ occasion it presents of doing good More than the perquisite: Where law shall speak Seldom, and never but as wisdom prompts And equity; not jealous more to guard A worthless form, than to decide aright: Where fashion shall not sanctify abuse, Nor smooth good-breeding (supplemental grace) With lean performance ape the work of love.  . . .   He is the happy man, whose life ev’n now Shows somewhat of that happier life to come; Who, doom’d to an obscure but tranquil state, Is pleas’d with it, and, were he free to chuse, Would make his fate his choice; whom peace, the fruit Of virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith, Prepare for happiness; bespeak him one Content indeed to sojourn while he must Below the skies, but having there his home. The world o’erlooks him in her busy search Of objects more illustrious in her view; And, occupy’d as earnestly as she, Though more sublimely, he o’erlooks the world. She scorns his pleasures, for she knows them not; He seeks not hers, for he has prov’d them vain. He cannot skim the ground like summer birds Pursuing gilded flies, and such he deems Her honors, her emoluments, her joys. Therefore in contemplation is his bliss, Whose pow’r is such, that whom she lifts from earth She makes familiar with a heav’n unseen, And shows him glories yet to be reveal’d. . . . So life glides smoothly and by stealth away, More golden than that age of fabled gold Renown’d in ancient song; not vex’d with care Or stain’d with guilt, beneficent, approv’d Of God and man, and peaceful in its end. So glide my life away! and so at last, My share of duties decently fulfill’d, May some disease, not tardy to perform Its destin’d office, yet with gentle stroke, Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat, Beneath a turf that I have often trod. It shall not grieve me, then, that once, when call’d To dress a Sofa with the flow’rs of verse, I play’d awhile, obedient to the fair, With that light task; but soon, to please her more Whom flow’rs alone I knew would little please, Let fall th’ unfinish’d wreath, and rov’d for fruit; Rov’d far, and gather’d much: some harsh, ’tis true, Pick’d from the thorns and briars of reproof, But wholesome, well-digested; grateful some To palates that can taste immortal truth, Insipid else, and sure to be despis’d.

How do you say: In my country\nthey buried me alive for six months?\nAnd so you lie and tell yourself this is love.\nI am protecting the world from my rage. \nRabab tells me: We know how to build graves\nhere. I nod. I know. It is the same all over Africa. \nDo you have a knife? Do you have one?\nthe guards at the museum ask Breyten and me,\nsearching us. We call this on ourselves. We\nare clearly political criminals. \nI trace the glyphs chipped into stone.\nAs a writer I am drawn to this. If I could\nI too would carve myself into eternity.\nBreyten watching me says: Don’t tell me\nyou’ve found a spelling mistake in it! \nA line of miniature statues is placed\ninto the tomb to serve the pharaoh.\nOne for each day of the year. Four hundred.\nThe overseers are a plus. I think\neven death will not ease\nthe lot of the poor here. \nStatues: it seems the more I search the world\nfor differences the more I find it all the same.\nPerhaps the Buddha was a jaded traveler too\nwhen he said we are all one. \nMona argues about who should pay\nto see the mummies. It isn’t often I can\ntreat a girl to a dead body, Breyten insists. \nA woman nearby tells her husand she can see\ndead bodies at work. Why pay?\nDo you think she works in a hospital? I ask.\nThat or the U.S. State Department, Breyten agrees. \nFrom the top of Bab Zwelia, flat rooftops\nspread out like a conference of coffee tables.\nBroken walls, furniture, pots, litter the roofs\nlike family secrets sunning themselves.\nTwo white goats on a roof chew\ntheir way through the debris. \nOn the Nile, Rabab sings in Arabic, tells me\nshe wants to be Celine Dion.\nShe is my sister calling me home to Egypt.\nPerhaps one day I will be ready.\nFor now it is enough to know I can\nbe at home here.\n', '\nAll of the Indians must have tragic features: tragic noses, eyes, and arms.\nTheir hands and fingers must be tragic when they reach for tragic food. \nThe hero must be a half-breed, half white and half Indian, preferably\nfrom a horse culture. He should often weep alone. That is mandatory. \nIf the hero is an Indian woman, she is beautiful. She must be slender\nand in love with a white man. But if she loves an Indian man \nthen he must be a half-breed, preferably from a horse culture.\nIf the Indian woman loves a white man, then he has to be so white \nthat we can see the blue veins running through his skin like rivers.\nWhen the Indian woman steps out of her dress, the white man gasps \nat the endless beauty of her brown skin. She should be compared to nature:\nbrown hills, mountains, fertile valleys, dewy grass, wind, and clear water. \nIf she is compared to murky water, however, then she must have a secret.\nIndians always have secrets, which are carefully and slowly revealed. \nYet Indian secrets can be disclosed suddenly, like a storm.\nIndian men, of course, are storms. They should destroy the lives \nof any white women who choose to love them. All white women love\nIndian men. That is always the case. White women feign disgust \nat the savage in blue jeans and T-shirt, but secretly lust after him.\nWhite women dream about half-breed Indian men from horse cultures. \nIndian men are horses, smelling wild and gamey. When the Indian man\nunbuttons his pants, the white woman should think of topsoil. \nThere must be one murder, one suicide, one attempted rape.\nAlcohol should be consumed. Cars must be driven at high speeds. \nIndians must see visions. White people can have the same visions\nif they are in love with Indians. If a white person loves an Indian \nthen the white person is Indian by proximity. White people must carry\nan Indian deep inside themselves. Those interior Indians are half-breed \nand obviously from horse cultures. If the interior Indian is male\nthen he must be a warrior, especially if he is inside a white man. \nIf the interior Indian is female, then she must be a healer, especially if she is inside\na white woman. Sometimes there are complications. \nAn Indian man can be hidden inside a white woman. An Indian woman\ncan be hidden inside a white man. In these rare instances, \neverybody is a half-breed struggling to learn more about his or her horse culture.\nThere must be redemption, of course, and sins must be forgiven. \nFor this, we need children. A white child and an Indian child, gender\nnot important, should express deep affection in a childlike way. \nIn the Great American Indian novel, when it is finally written,\nall of the white people will be Indians and all of the Indians will be ghosts.\n', '\nThe body is a nation I have not known.\nThe pure joy of air: the moment between leaping\nfrom a cliff into the wall of blue below. Like that.\nOr to feel the rub of tired lungs against skin-\ncovered bone, like a hand against the rough of bark.\nLike that. “The body is a savage,” I said.\nFor years I said that: the body is a savage.\nAs if this safety of the mind were virtue\nnot cowardice. For years I have snubbed\nthe dark rub of it, said, “I am better, Lord,\nI am better,” but sometimes, in an unguarded\nmoment of sun, I remember the cowdung-scent\nof my childhood skin thick with dirt and sweat\nand the screaming grass.\nBut this distance I keep is not divine,\nfor what was Christ if not God’s desire\nto smell his own armpit? And when I\nsee him, I know he will smile,\nfingers glued to his nose, and say, “Next time\nI will send you down as a dog\nto taste this pure hunger.”\n', '\n1. \nGod love you now, if no one else will ever,\nCorpse in the paddy, or dead on a high hill\nIn the fine and ruinous summer of a war\nYou never wanted. All your false flags were\nOf bravery and ignorance, like grade school maps:\nColors of countries you would never see—\nUntil that weekend in eternity\nWhen, laughing, well armed, perfectly ready to kill\nThe world and your brother, the safe commanders sent\nYou into your future. Oh, dead on a hill,\nDead in a paddy, leeched and tumbled to\nA tomb of footnotes. We mourn a changeling: you:\nHandselled to poverty and drummed to war\nBy distinguished masters whom you never knew. \n2. \nThe bee that spins his metal from the sun,\nThe shy mole drifting like a miner ghost\nThrough midnight earth—all happy creatures run\nAs strict as trains on rails the circuits of\nBlind instinct. Happy in your summer follies,\nYou mined a culture that was mined for war:\nThe state to mold you, church to bless, and always\nThe elders to confirm you in your ignorance.\nNo scholar put your thinking cap on nor\nWarned that in dead seas fishes died in schools\nBefore inventing legs to walk the land.\nThe rulers stuck a tennis racket in your hand,\nAn Ark against the flood. In time of change\nCourage is not enough: the blind mole dies,\nAnd you on your hill, who did not know the rules. \n3. \nWet in the windy counties of the dawn\nThe lone crow skirls his draggled passage home:\nAnd God (whose sparrows fall aslant his gaze,\nLike grace or confetti) blinks and he is gone,\nAnd you are gone. Your scarecrow valor grows\nAnd rusts like early lilac while the rose\nBlooms in Dakota and the stock exchange\nFlowers. Roses, rents, all things conspire\nTo crown your death with wreaths of living fire.\nAnd the public mourners come: the politic tear\nIs cast in the Forum. But, in another year,\nWe will mourn you, whose fossil courage fills\nThe limestone histories: brave: ignorant: amazed:\nDead in the rice paddies, dead on the nameless hills.\n', '\nThe telephone never rings.

the god of the feed bucket and serveth him.\nFor she worships the god in him and the secret of his pail in her way.\nFor this is done by screams of incantation at the appointed hour and lusty bites of daily communion.\nFor she stands with forelegs upon the top rail of the wooden fence in supplication.\nFor she grunts her thanks while she eats.\nFor she stands for the red boar with closed eyes at the appointed hour.\nFor having done she lies in the mud to consider herself.\nFor this she performs in ten degrees.\nFor first she rolls in her wallow to cover her body.\nFor secondly she lies still to feel the wet.\nFor thirdly she stretches her length and casts her belly to the sun.\nFor fourthly she exhales God’s air in huge sighs.\nFor fifthly she rises and examines her feed trough that replenishment might miraculously appear.\nFor sixthly she scratches her side against the fence.\nFor seventhly she scratches her jowl with delicate pastern swipe.\nFor eighthly she smells the breeze to ascertain the red boar’s presence.\nFor ninthly she returns to her mud and plows large holes in the earth.\nFor tenthly she lies again in the wallow to cool her frame.\nFor having considered her world she will sleep and dream dreams of herself and her god and the red boar.\nFor like Eve for softness she and sweet attractive Grace was formed.\nFor the red boar lusteth mightily and foameth at the mouth for her.\nFor he might escape and enter her pen.\nFor if he does this in a nonappointed hour she will scream loudly and discourage his kisses.\nFor her belly is full and needeth no more.\nFor in one month she will bring forth life in abundance.\nFor in her last litter she farrowed eight piglets of the red boar.\nFor three were black and five were red.\nFor she raised them all and laid on none.\nFor one in eight is normally crushed by the sow.\nFor she is exceedingly good in all that she does.\nFor she is surely of the tribe of Elephant and forgetteth not.\nFor she weighs near six hundred pounds.\nFor she has ears of tremendous size.\nFor she is heavy.\nFor a large sow is a term of the Titan Elephant.\nFor she has the appetite of a bird and would eat the day long which in debt her master suppresses.\nFor he would not have her too fat or his checkbook hollow.\nFor he keeps her well-fed and she breaks no fence.\nFor she grunts in pleasure from the mud when he scratches her ears.\nFor she is a tool of God to temper his mind.\nFor when she eats her corn she turns and shits in her trough.\nFor her master is provoked but hereby learns patience.\nFor she is an instrument for him to learn bankruptcy upon.\nFor he lost but four dollars each on the last litter of pigs.\nFor this is admirable in the world of the bank.\nFor every man is incomplete without one serious debt or loss.\nFor she provides this with her good faith.\nFor every farm is a skeleton without a mortgage.\nFor the Lord admonished black sows when he said lay up no stores of treasure on earth.\nFor she prohibits this daily.\nFor she is a true child of God and creature of the universe.\nFor she is called Blackula which is a derivative of the Devil, but false.\nFor she does worship her God and Savior.\nFor she was given her name for breaking a fence and eating Jan’s garden beets.\nFor when Jan came with a stick and wrath she lifted her head and smiled.\nFor her teeth and mouth were stained with red beet pulp.\nFor Jan dropped the stick and laughed.\nFor she looked like a six-hundred-pound vampire.\nFor she was called Blackula.\nFor we feed her red beets daily to watch her smile.\nFor she is humble when well-fed.\nFor she makes her point well when she is hungry.\nFor there is nothing swifter than a sow breaking fence when she desires.\nFor there is nothing more beautiful than a sow in full run when being chased through a garden.\nFor there is no sound more pure than her scream when she is hit with a stick.\nFor she is meek in all aspects when satisfied.\nFor when John Sims saw her lying in mud he proclaimed her majesty.\nFor he whistled and called her a pretty sonofabitch.\nFor he offered to trade his beat-up truck for her straight across.\nFor she has divine spirit and is manifest as a complete pig.\nFor she is tame and can be taught.\nFor she can run and walk and sleep and drink and eat.\nFor she can scream at the red boar.\nFor she allows her ears and belly to be scratched.\nFor she allows small children to ride her back.\nFor she sleeps in mounds of straw at night.\nFor she produces litters of healthy black and red pigs.\nFor she can root the earth.\nFor she can carry sticks in her mouth.\nFor she will grunt when she is addressed.\nFor she can jump not far but hard.\nFor dried earth cracks in the places where she walks.\nFor she is hated by the breeders of cattle and sheep.\nFor the former loses more money than I do on his stock.\nFor the latter fears her mind.\nFor she has no wool and will not blindly follow his steps.\nFor he carries no bucket of feed.\nFor she litters twice per year.\nFor he litters but once.\nFor her belly is firm and can take much abuse.\nFor from this proceeds her worth.\nFor I perceive God’s mystery by stroking her teats.\nFor I felt tiny lumps of flesh within and knew they were alive.\nFor the life is the physical substance which God sends from Heaven to sustain the appetites of men.\nFor God has blessed her womb and the red boar’s seed.\nFor they multiply in ecstasy at the appointed time.\nFor God has blessed her in many ways.\nFor God has given her the red beets to eat.\nFor God has given the water for her to drink.\nFor God has allowed the water to run to mud in a place for her to lay.\nFor she cannot fly to the mountain streams, though she walks well upon the earth.\nFor she walks the earth heavy upon tiny feet.\nFor she treads all the rows of the summer garden.\nFor she can jump the fence.\nFor she can push it down.\nFor she can eat.\n', '\nPyongyang, if you’ll please,

What if it really was\ninstead of the place of rotting sandbags,\nincoming heavy artillery, rats and mud. \nWhat if the angels were Ames and Ski,\nor the lady, the man, and the boy,\nand they lifted Gaffney out of the mud\nand healed his shattered knee? \nWhat if none of it happened the way I said?\nWould it all be a lie?\nWould the wreckage be suddenly beautiful?\nWould the dead rise up and walk?\n', '\nStill half drunk, after a night at cards,\nwith the grey dawn taking us unaware\namong our guilty kings and queens, we drove\nfar North in the morning, winners, losers,\nto a stream in the high hills, to climb up to a place\none of us knew, with some vague view\nof cutting losses or consolidating gains\nby the old standard appeal to the wilderness,\nthe desert, the empty places of our exile,\nbringing only the biblical bread and cheese\nand cigarettes got from a grocer’s on the way,\nexpecting to drink only the clear cold water\namong the stones, and remember, or forget.\nThough no one said anything about atonement,\nthere was still some purgatorial idea\nin all those aching heads and ageing hearts\nas we climbed the giant stair of the stream,\nreaching the place around noon. \nIt was as promised, a wonder, with granite walls\nenclosing ledges, long and flat, of limestone,\nor, rolling, of lava; within the ledges\nthe water, fast and still, pouring its yellow light,\nand green, over the tilted slabs of the floor,\nblackened at shady corners, falling in a foam\nof crystal to a calm where the waterlight\ndappled the ledges as they leaned\nagainst the sun; big blue dragonflies hovered\nand darted and dipped a wing, hovered again\nagainst the low wind moving over the stream,\nand shook the flakes of light from their clear wings.\nThis surely was it, was what we had come for,\nwas nature, though it looked like art with its\ngrey fortress walls and laminated benches\nas in the waiting room of some petrified station.\nBut we believed; and what it was we believed\nmade of the place a paradise\nfor ruined poker players, win or lose,\nwho stripped naked and bathed and dried out on the rocks\nlike gasping trout (the water they drank\nmaking them drunk again), lit cigarettes and lay back\nwaiting for nature to say the last word\n—as though the stones were Memnon stones,\nwhich, caught in a certain light, would sing. \nThe silence (and even the noise of the waters\nwas silence) grew pregnant; that is the phrase,\ngrew pregnant; but nothing else did.\nThe mountains brought forth not a mouse, and the rocks,\nunlike the ones you would expect to find\non the slopes of Purgatory or near Helicon,\nmollified by muses and with a little give to ’em,\nwere modern American rocks, and hard as rocks.\nOur easy bones groaned, our flesh baked\non one side and shuddered on the other; and each man\nthought bitterly about primitive simplicity\nand decadence, and how he had been ruined\nby civilization and forced by circumstances\nto drink and smoke and sit up all night\ninspecting those perfectly arbitrary cards\nuntil he was broken-winded as a trout on a rock\nand had no use for the doctrines of Jean Jacques\nRousseau, and could no longer afford\na savagery whether noble or not; some\nwould never batter that battered copy of Walden\nagain. \n         But all the same,\nthe water, the sunlight, and the wind\ndid something; even the dragonflies\ndid something to the minds full of telephone\nnumbers and flushes, to the flesh\nsweating bourbon on one side and freezing on the other.\nAnd the rocks, the old and tumbling boulders\nwhich formed the giant stair of the stream,\ninduced (again) some purgatorial ideas\nconcerning humility, concerning patience\nand enduring what had to be endured,\nwinning and losing and breaking even;\nideas of weathering in whatever weather,\nbeing eroded, or broken, or ground down into pebbles\nby the stream’s necessitous and grave currents.\nBut to these ideas did any purgatory\nrespond? Only this one: that in a world\nwhere even the Memnon stones were carved in soap\none might at any rate wash with the soap. \nAfter a time we talked about the War,\nabout what we had done in the War, and how near\nsome of us had been to being drowned, and burned,\nand shot, and how many people we knew\nwho had been drowned, or burned, or shot;\nand would it have been better to have died\nin the War, the peaceful old War, where we were young?\nBut the mineral peace, or paralysis, of those\ngreat stones, the moving stillness of the waters,\nentered our speech; the ribs and blood\nof the earth, from which all fables grow,\nestablished poetry and truth in us,\nso that at last one said, “I shall play cards\nuntil the day I die,” and another said,\n“in bourbon whisky are all the vitamins\nand minerals needed to sustain man’s life,”\nand still another, “I shall live on smoke\nuntil my spirit has been cured of flesh.” \nClimbing downstream again, on the way home\nto the lives we had left empty for a day,\nwe noticed, as not before, how of three bridges\nnot one had held the stream, which in its floods\nhad twisted the girders, splintered the boards, hurled\nboulder on boulder, and had broken into rubble,\nsmashed practically back to nature,\nthe massive masonry of span after span\nwith its indifferent rage; this was a sight\nthat sobered us considerably, and kept us quiet\nboth during the long drive home and after,\ntill it was time to deal the cards.\n', '\nI the people\nto the things that are were &\n      come to be.\nWe were once what we know\n      when we\nmake love    When we go away\n      from each other because\nwe have been created\n      at 10th & A, in winter &\nof trees & of the history of houses\n      we hope we are\nnotes of the musical scale of\n      heaven—I the\npeople so repetitious, & my\n      vision of\nto hold the neighbors loose-\n      ly here in\nlight of gel, my gel, my vision\n      come out of\nmy eyes to hold you sur-\n      round you in\ngold & you don’t know it\n      ever.

Of these he spins\nRelation out, he weaves its fabric up\nSo that it speaks darkly, as music does\nSinging the secret history of the mind.\nAnd when in this the visible world appears,\nAs it does do, mountain, flower, cloud, and tree,\nAll haunted here and there with the human face,\nIt happens as by accident, although\nThe accident is of design. It is because\nLanguage first rises from the speechless world\nThat the painterly intelligence\nCan say correctly that he makes his world,\nNot imitates the one before his eyes.\nHence the delightsome gardens, the dark shores,\nThe terrifying forests where nightfall\nEnfolds a lost and tired traveler. \nAnd hence the careless crowd deludes itself\nBy likening his hieroglyphic signs\nAnd secret alphabets to the drawing of a child.\nThat likeness is significant the other side\nOf what they see, for his simplicities\nAre not the first ones, but the furthest ones,\nFinal refinements of his thought made visible.\nHe is the painter of the human mind\nFinding and faithfully reflecting the mindfulness\nThat is in things, and not the things themselves. \nFor such a man, art is an act of faith:\nPrayer the study of it, as Blake says,\nAnd praise the practice; nor does he divide\nMaking from teaching, or from theory.\nThe three are one, and in his hours of art\nThere shines a happiness through darkest themes,\nAs though spirit and sense were not at odds.  \nII \nThe painter as an allegory of the mind\nAt genesis. He takes a burlap bag,\nTears it open and tacks it on a stretcher.\nHe paints it black because, as he has said,\nEverything looks different on black. \nSuppose the burlap bag to be the universe,\nAnd black because its volume is the void\nBefore the stars were. At the painter’s hand\nVolume becomes one-sidedly a surface,\nAnd all his depths are on the face of it. \nAgainst this flat abyss, this groundless ground\nOf zero thickness stretched against the cold\nDark silence of the Absolutely Not,\nMaterial worlds arise, the colored earths\nAnd oil of plants that imitate the light. \nThey imitate the light that is in thought,\nFor the mind relates to thinking as the eye\nRelates to light. Only because the world\nAlready is a language can the painter speak\nAccording to his grammar of the ground. \nIt is archaic speech, that has not yet\nDivided out its cadences in words;\nIt is a language for the oldest spells\nAbout how some thoughts rose into the mind\nWhile others, stranger still, sleep in the world. \nSo grows the garden green, the sun vermilion.\nHe sees the rose flame up and fade and fall\nAnd be the same rose still, the radiant in red.\nHe paints his language, and his language is\nThe theory of what the painter thinks.  \nIII \nThe painter’s eye attends to death and birth\nTogether, seeing a single energy\nMomently manifest in every form,\nAs in the tree the growing of the tree\nExploding from the seed not more nor less\nThan from the void condensing down and in,\nSummoning sun and rain. He views the tree,\nThe great tree standing in the garden, say,\nAs thrusting downward its vast spread and weight,\nGrowing its green height from the dark watered earth,\nAnd as suspended weightless in the sky,\nHaled forth and held up by the hair of its head.\nHe follows through the flowing of the forms\nFrom the divisions of the trunk out to\nThe veinings of the leaf, and the leaf’s fall.\nHis pencil meditates the many in the one\nAfter the method in the confluence of rivers,\nThe running of ravines on mountainsides,\nAnd in the deltas of the nerves; he sees\nHow things must be continuous with themselves\nAs with whole worlds that they themselves are not,\nIn order that they may be so transformed.\nHe stands where the eternity of thought\nOpens upon perspective time and space;\nHe watches mind become incarnate; then\n               He paints the tree.  \nIV \nThese thoughts have chiefly been about the painter Klee,\nAbout how he in our hard time might stand to us\nEspecially whose lives concern themselves with learning\nAs patron of the practical intelligence of art,\nAnd thence as model, modest and humorous in sufferings,\nFor all research that follows spirit where it goes. \nThat there should be much goodness in the world,\nMuch kindness and intelligence, candor and charm,\nAnd that it all goes down in the dust after a while,\nThis is a subject for the steadiest meditations\nOf the heart and mind, as for the tears\nThat clarify the eye toward charity. \nSo may it be to all of us, that at some times\nIn this bad time when faith in study seems to fail,\nAnd when impatience in the street and still despair at home\nDivide the mind to rule it, there shall be some comfort come\nFrom the remembrance of so deep and clear a life as his\nWhom I have thought of, for the wholeness of his mind,\nAs the painter dreaming in the scholar’s house,\nHis dream an emblem to us of the life of thought,\nThe same dream that then flared before intelligence\nWhen light first went forth looking for the eye.\n', '\n\n\n\n“painting has no air . . .”\n          —Gertrude Stein\n\n\n\nThat there should never be air\nin a picture surprises me.\nIt would seem to be only a picture\nof a certain kind, a portrait in paper\nor glue, somewhere a stickiness\nas opposed to a stick-to-it-ness\nof another genre. It might be\nquite new to do without\nthat air, or to find oxygen\non the landscape line\nlike a boat which is an object\nor a shoe which never floats\nand is stationary. \n                              Still there\nare certain illnesses that require\nair, lots of it. And there are nervous\npeople who cannot manufacture\nenough air and must seek\nfor it when they don’t have plants,\nin pictures.

Stage right, enter twit:“Mr. Ashbery, I’m your biggest campus fan.” We hit it offAnd talked about “The Skaters” and my preference for “Clepsydra” Vs. “Fragment.” Later on that night John asked me to a party in New York, And Saturday, after dinner and a panel on the artist’s role as something (And a party), driving Lewis’s Austin-Healey through the rain I sealed our friendship with an accident. The party was on Broadway,An apartment (white of course, with paintings) just downstairsFrom Frank O’Hara’s, who finally wandered down. I talked to himA little about Love Poems (Tentative Title), which pleased him,And quoted a line from “Poem” about the rain, which seemed to please him too.The party ended, John and I went off to Max’s, ordered steaks And talked about our mothers. All that talking!—poems and paintings,Parents, all those parties, and the age of manifestos still to come!I started coming to New York for lunch. We’d meet at Art News,Walk to Fifty-sixth Street to Larre’s, a restaurant filled with French expatriates,Have martinis and the prix fixe for $2.50 (!), drink rose de ProvenceAnd talk (of course) about Genet and James and words like “Coca-Cola.”It was an afternoon in May when John brought up a playThat he and Kenneth Koch and Frank O’Hara—Holy Trinity!(Batman was in vogue)—had started years ago and never finished.There was a dictator named Edgar and some penicillin,But that’s all I remember. They hadn’t actually been togetherIn years, but planned to finish it that night at John’s new apartmentOn Ninety-fifth Street, and he said to come by for a drinkBefore they ate and got to work. It was a New York dreamCome true: a brownstone floor-through, white and full of paintings(Naturally), “with a good library and record collection.”John had procured a huge steak, and as I helped him set the tableThe doorbell rang and Frank O’Hara, fresh from the museumAnd svelte in a hound’s tooth sports coat entered, followed shortlyBy “excitement-prone Kenneth Koch” in somber gray,And I was one with my immortals. In the small mythologiesWe make up out of memories and the flow of timeA few moments remain frozen, though the feel of them is lost,The feel of talk. It ranged from puns to gossip, always coming back To poems and poets. Frank was fiercely loyal to young poets(Joe Ceravolo’s name came up I think), and when I mentioned LewisIn a way that must have sounded catty, he leapt to his defense,Leaving me to backtrack in embarrassment and have another drink,Which is what everyone had. I think you see where it was going:Conversation drifting into dinner, then I stayed for dinnerAnd everyone forgot about the play, which was never finished(Though I think I’ve seen a fragment of it somewhere). I see a tableIn a cone of light, but there’s no sound except for Kenneth’s Deadpan “Love to see a boy eat” as I speared a piece of steak;And then the only voice I’m sure I hear is mine,As those moments that had once seemed singular and clearDissolve into a “general mess of imprecision of feeling”And images, augmented by line breaks. There were phone calls,Other people arrived, the narrative of the night dissolvedAnd finally everyone went home. School and spring wound down.The semester ended, then the weekend that I wrote about in “Sally’s Hair”Arrived and went, and then a late-night cruise around Manhattan for a rich friend’sParents’ anniversary bash, followed by an Upper East Side preppie barThat left me looking for a place to crash, and so I rang John’s bell at 2 AMAnd failed (thank God) to rouse him, caught a plane to San DiegoThe next day, worked at my summer job and worked on poemsAnd started reading Proust, and got a card one afternoonFrom Peter Schjeldahl telling me that Frank O’Hara had been killed.Ninety-fifth Street soldiered on for several years.I remember a cocktail party (the symposium of those days),Followed by dinner just around the corner at Elaine’s,Pre-Woody Allen. It was there I learned of R.F.K.’s assassinationWhen I woke up on the daybed in the living room, and whereJohn told me getting married would ruin me as a poet(I don’t know why—most of his friends were married), a judgmentHe revised when he met Susan and inscribed The Double Dream of Spring“If this is all we need fear from spinach, then I don’t mind so much”(Which was probably premature—watering his plants one dayShe soaked his landlord, Giorgio Cavallon, dozing in the garden below).It was where Peter Delacorte late one night recited an entire sideOf a Firesign Theatre album from memory, and set John on that path,To his friends’ subsequent dismay, and where he blessed me with his extra copyOf The Poems, and next day had second thoughts (though I kept it anyway). Sometimes a vague, amorphous stretch of years assumes a shape,And then becomes an age, and then a golden age alive with possibilities,When change was in the air and you could wander through its streetsAs though through Florence and the Renaissance. I know it sounds ridiculous,But that’s the way life flows: in stages that take form in retrospect,When all the momentary things that occupy the mind from day to dayHave vanished into time, and something takes their place that wasn’t there,A sense of freedom—one which gradually slipped away. The centerOf the conversation moved downtown, the Renaissance gave way to mannerismAs the junior faculty took charge, leaving the emeriti alone and out of itOf course, lying on the fringes, happily awake; but for the rest The laws proscribing what you couldn’t do were clear. I got so tiredOf writing all those New York poems (though by then I’d moved to Boston—To Siena, you might say) that led to nowhere but the next one,So I started writing poems about whatever moved me: what it’s likeTo be alive within a world that holds no place for you, yet seems so beautiful;The feeling of the future, and its disappointments; the trajectory of a life,That always brought me back to time and memory (I’d finished Proust by then),And brings me back to this. John finally moved downtown himself,Into a two-story apartment at Twenty-fifth and Tenth, with a spiral staircase Leading to a library, the locus of the incident of Susan, Alydar and John And the pitcher of water (I’ll draw a veil over it), and Jimmy Schuyler sighing“It’s so beautiful,” as Bernadette Peters sang “Raining in My Heart” from Dames at Sea.The poetry still continued—mine and everyone’s. I’d added Jimmy To my pantheon (as you’ve probably noticed), but the night in nineteen sixty-six Seemed more and more remote: I never saw Kenneth anymore,And there were new epicenters, with new casts of characters, like Madoo, Bob Dash’s garden in Sagaponack, and Bill and Willy’s loft in Soho.John moved again, to Twenty-second Street, and Susan and I moved to Milwaukee,Where our son was born. I stopped coming to New York, and writing poems, For several years, while I tried to dream enough philosophy for tenure.One afternoon in May I found myself at Ninth and Twenty-second,And as though on cue two people whom I hadn’t seen in years—David Kalstone, Darragh Park—just happened by, and then I took a taxi down to SohoTo the loft, and then a gallery to hear Joe Brainard read from I Remember,Back to John’s and out to dinner—as though I’d never been away, Though it was all too clear I had. Poems were in the air, but theory too, And members of the thought police department (who must have also gotten tenure) Turned up everywhere, with arguments that poetry was called upon to prove.It mattered, but in a different way, as though it floated free from poemsAnd wasn’t quite the point. I kept on coming back, as I still do.Half my life was still to come, and yet the rest was mostly personal:I got divorced, and Willy killed himself, and here I am now, ready to retire.There was an obituary in the Times last week for Michael Goldberg,A painter you’ll recall from Frank O’Hara’s poems (“Why I Am Not a Painter,”“Ode to Michael Goldberg (’s Birth and Other Births)”). I didn’t know him,But a few months after the soiree on Ninety-fifth Street I was at a partyIn his studio on the Bowery, which was still his studio when he died.The New York art world demimonde was there, including nearly everyoneWho’s turned up in this poem. I remember staring at a guy whoLooked like something from the Black Lagoon, dancing with a gorgeousWoman half his age. That’s my New York: an island dreamOf personalities and evenings, nights where poetry was second natureAnd their lives flowed through it and around it as it gave them life.O brave new world (now old) that had such people in’t!\n*     *     *\n“The tiresome old man is telling us his life story.” I guess I am, but that’s what poets do—not always Quite as obviously as this, and usually more by indirectionAnd omission, but beneath the poetry lies the singular reality And unreality of an individual life. I see it as a long,Illuminated tunnel, lined with windows giving on the scenes outside—On Ninety-fifth Street forty years ago. As life goes onYou start to get increasingly distracted by your own reflectionAnd the darkness gradually becoming visible at the end. I try not to look too far ahead, but just to stay here— Quick now, here, now, always—only something pulls meBack (as they say) to the day, when poems were more like secrets,With their own vernacular, and you could tell your friends By who and what they read. And now John’s practically become A national treasure, and whenever I look up I think I see him Floating in the sky like the Cheshire Cat. I don’t knowWhat to make of it, but it makes me happy—like seeing Kenneth Just before he died (“I’m going west John, I’m going west”) In his apartment on a side street near Columbia, or rememberingOnce again that warm spring night in nineteen sixty-six. I like to think of them together once again, at the cocktail partyAt the end of the mind, where I could blunder in and ruin it one last time.Meanwhile, on a hillside in the driftless region to the west,A few miles from the small town where The Straight Story ends,I’m building a house on a meadow, if I’m permitted to return,Behind a screen of trees above a lower meadow, with some apple treesIn which the fog collects on autumn afternoons, and a vistaOf an upland pasture without heaviness. I see myselfSitting on the deck and sipping a martini, as I used to at Larre’s, In a future that feels almost like a past I’m positive is there— But where? I think my life is still all conversation,Only now it’s with myself. I can see it continuing forever,Even in my absence, as I close the windows and turn off the lightsAnd it begins to rain. And then we’re there together In the house on the meadow, waiting for whatever’s left to comeIn what’s become the near future—two versions of myself And of the people that we knew, each one an otherTo the other, yet both indelibly there: the twit of twentyAnd the aging child of sixty-two, still separateAnd searching in the night, listening through the nightTo the noise of the rain and memories of rainAnd evenings when we’d wander out into the Renaissance,When I could see you and talk to you and it could still change;And still there in the morning when the rain has stopped,And the apples are all getting tinted in the cool light. \n', '\n\n\n\nFrom "Shorter Chaucer Tales" (2006)\n\n\n\nThe great labour of appearanceServed the making of the pyre.

On the nightstand a basket with peanut butter crackers, a vivid and unnatural orange, a crinkly wrap. A knee-high fridge stocked with icy juices, foil boxes, straws glued on. A female voice next door claimed she was still a human being, though I could not hear the reasons. When it was my turn, I answered right away, saying I knew where I was and why. No, I would not harm myself, surprised to be asked as I had never had the thought. Yes I knew where I was going next. Out the window and through shadow and streetlight, I saw how this building connected to the next. I was to follow a stripe painted on the wall. Someone would walk with me as well.

Such is thy pow'r, nor are thine orders vain,O thou the leader of the mental train:In full perfection all thy works are wrought,And thine the sceptre o'er the realms of thought.Before thy throne the subject-passions bow,Of subject-passions sov'reign ruler thou;At thy command joy rushes on the heart,And through the glowing veins the spirits dart.    Fancy might now her silken pinions tryTo rise from earth, and sweep th' expanse on high:From Tithon's bed now might Aurora rise,Her cheeks all glowing with celestial dies,While a pure stream of light o'erflows the skies.The monarch of the day I might behold,And all the mountains tipt with radiant gold,But I reluctant leave the pleasing views,Which Fancy dresses to delight the Muse;Winter austere forbids me to aspire,And northern tempests damp the rising fire;They chill the tides of Fancy's flowing sea,Cease then, my song, cease the unequal lay.\n", "\nFamilies when a child is born\nHope it will turn out intelligent.\nI, through intelligence\nHaving wrecked my whole life,\nOnly hope that the baby will prove\nIgnorant and stupid.\nThen he'll be happy all his days\nAnd grow into a cabinet minister.\n", "\nMy father at the dictionary-stand   \nTouches the page to fully understand   \nThe lamplit answer, tilting in his hand \nHis slowly scanning magnifying lens,   \nA blurry, glistening circle he suspends\nAbove the word “Carnation.” Then he bends \nSo near his eyes are magnified and blurred,   \nOne finger on the miniature word,   \nAs if he touched a single key and heard \nA distant, plucked, infinitesimal string,   \n“The obligation due to every thing   \nThat’s smaller than the universe.” I bring \nMy sewing needle close enough that I\nCan watch my father through the needle’s eye,   \nAs through a lens ground for a butterfly \nWho peers down flower-hallways toward a room   \nShadowed and fathomed as this study’s gloom   \nWhere, as a scholar bends above a tomb \nTo read what’s buried there, he bends to pore   \nOver the Latin blossom.

For the butterfly slept, as such thoughtless ones will,    At ease, and reclining on flowers, If ever they study, ’t is how they may kill    The best of their mid-summer hours.  And the butterfly dreamed, as is often the case    With indolent lovers of change, Who, keeping the body at ease in its place,    Give fancy permission to range.  He dreamed that he saw, what he could but despise,    The swarm from a neighbouring hive; Which, having come out for their winter supplies,    Had made the whole garden alive.  He looked with disgust, as the proud often do,    On the diligent movements of those, Who, keeping both present and future in view,    Improve every hour as it goes. As the brisk little alchymists passed to and fro,    With anger the butterfly swelled; And called them mechanics – a rabble too low    To come near the station he held.  ‘Away from my presence!’ said he, in his sleep,    ‘Ye humbled plebeians! nor dare Come here with your colorless winglets to sweep    The king of this brilliant parterre!’  He thought, at these words, that together they flew,    And, facing about, made a stand; And then, to a terrible army they grew,    And fenced him on every hand.  Like hosts of huge giants, his numberless foes    Seemed spreading to measureless size: Their wings with a mighty expansion arose,    And stretched like a veil o’er the skies.  Their eyes seemed like little volcanoes, for fire,—      Their hum, to a cannon-peal grown,— Farina to bullets was rolled in their ire,    And, he thought, hurled at him and his throne.  He tried to cry quarter! his voice would not sound,    His head ached – his throne reeled and fell; His enemy cheered, as he came to the ground,    And cried, ‘King Papilio, farewell!’  His fall chased the vision – the sleeper awoke,    The wonderful dream to expound; The lightning’s bright flash from the thunder-cloud broke,    And hail-stones were rattling around.  He’d slumbered so long, that now, over his head,    The tempest’s artillery rolled; The tulip was shattered – the whirl-blast had fled,    And borne off its crimson and gold.  ’T is said, for the fall and the pelting, combined    With suppressed ebullitions of pride, This vain son of summer no balsam could find,    But he crept under covert and died.\n', '\nAnd now, Mistress Mummy, since thus you’ve been found    By the world, that has long done without you, In your snug little hiding-place far under ground— Be pleased to speak out, as we gather around,    And let us hear something about you!

The clock too oft deceives,     Says what it cannot prove; While every one believes     The vane that turns above.  Reason oft speaks unbidden,     And chides us to our face; For which she should be chidden,     And taught to know her place.  While nonsense smiles and chatters,     And says such charming things, Like youthful hope she flatters;     And like a syren sings.

In that lost country\nThe eucalyptus trees have turned to stone.\nOnce, branches nudged me, dropping swollen blossoms,\nAnd passionflowers lit my father’s garden.\nIs it still there, that place of mottled shadow,   \nThe scarlet flowers breathing in the darkness? \nI remember how I died. It was so simple!\nOne morning the garden faded. My face blacked out.\nOn my left side they made the first incision.\nThey washed my heart and liver in palm wine—\nMy lungs were two dark fruit they stuffed with spices.\nThey smeared my innards with a sticky unguent\nAnd sealed them in a crock of alabaster. \nMy brain was next. A pointed instrument\nHooked it through my nostrils, strand by strand.   \nA voice swayed over me. I paid no notice.\nFor weeks my body swam in sweet perfume.\nI came out scoured. I was skin and bone.\nThey lifted me into the sun again\nAnd packed my empty skull with cinnamon. \nThey slit my toes; a razor gashed my fingertips.\nStitched shut at last, my limbs were chaste and valuable,\nStuffed with paste of cloves and wild honey.   \nMy eyes were empty, so they filled them up,\nInserting little nuggets of obsidian.\nA basalt scarab wedged between my breasts\nReplaced the tinny music of my heart. \nHands touched my sutures. I was so important!\nThey oiled my pores, rubbing a fragrance in.\nAn amber gum oozed down to soothe my temples.\nI wanted to sit up. My skin was luminous,   \nFrail as the shadow of an emerald.\nBefore I learned to love myself too much,   \nMy body wound itself in spools of linen. \nShut in my painted box, I am a precious object.\nI wear a wooden mask. These are my eyelids,\nTwo flakes of bronze, and here is my new mouth,\nChiseled with care, guarding its ruby facets.\nI will last forever. I am not impatient—\nMy skin will wait to greet its old complexions.\nI’ll lie here till the world swims back again. \nWhen I come home the garden will be budding,\nWhite petals breaking open, clusters of night flowers,\nThe far-off music of a tambourine.   \nA boy will pace among the passionflowers,\nHis eyes no longer two bruised surfaces.\nI’ll know the mouth of my young groom, I’ll touch\nHis hands.

Cold words and looks reprove Oh, turn not thus away Give kindly greetings, words of love And a heart which beats within.\n', '\n\n\n\nTo a Venetian coin, the first Gazetta             For its generic title became debtor.  \n\n\n\nWhither excursive Fancy tends thy Flight? Like Eastern Caliph masking thee at night, By Vezier memory attended still, Thou pertly pryest in each domicil. Woe! to the Caitiff then who in his cups, Unconscious with sublimity he sups, Shall vow in Bacchanalian truth or fun Thou art not kindred to the glorious sun! I fear thee not, clandestine ambulator! Thou most sophistical and specious traitor To Truth and Reason, those imperial twins Whose Empire with thy Martyrdom begins. What is thy drift in brandishing a flag, Whose motto is a metamorphosed rag! As by those motley streaks of white and jet, I trace that aboriginal Gazette, The British prototype of ’65 From which all modern journals we derive. At first confined to faction’s revelations, Mere politics, or plodding speculations. Now to a semi-cyclopedia risen Which the assembled arts, delight to dizen. Its grand mosaic ground work ever graced With polished gems of miscellaneous taste. Philosophy his portico regains In columns where profoundest science reigns. While in relief a neighboring sphere discloses Clio’s with Nature’s kind exotic roses. A curious melange of mental food In fragments thus promiscuously strewed; Rising Aeronauts, and sinking funds, Fearful phenomena of stars or suns. Men in the stocks, uneasy as old Kent, Others appalled by fluctuating rent. New ministers to preach, and spirit lamps, Foreign intelligence from Courts and Camps Don-Pedro – and a fresh supply of leeches A ball that blackens, and a wash that bleaches, Here, Hymen’s herald to the world declares When Love triumphant at his shrine appears. There, tenderness bereaved, its tribute brings And Hope’s crushed odours on Death’s altar flings.Advertisements of various commodities,   And anecdotes of Irish whims and oddities. Bills of mortality, and Board of Health, A fine green turtle – and a miser’s wealth. The prices current – a cheap hasty pudding, Detected fallacies – and falcon-hooding, Arrivals and departures – births and deaths, A dreadful Storm – and artificial wreaths, One fugitive forsakes the Cotton pod, In terror of the Supervisor’s rod. Another dreading critic castigation, Flies from the fields of rich imagination. Thus from discordant interests Genius hurled The elements that form this typic world.\n', '\nAn inland sea – blue as a sapphire – set   Within a sparkling, emerald mountain chain    Where day and night fir-needles sift like rain Thro’ the voluptuous air. The soft winds fret The waves, and beat them wantonly to foam.    The golden distances across the sea    Are shot with rose and purple. Languorously The silver seabirds in wide circles roam. The sun drops slowly down the flaming West    And flings its rays across to set aglow    The islands rocking on the cool waves’ crest And the great glistening domes of snow on snow.    And thro’ the mist the Olympics flash and float    Like opals linked around a beating throat.\n', '\nListen, Sanoe Dewy lehua bud Here I am Waiting for your voice.  The answer comesI am satisfied Softly, sweetheart You excite my whole being.  My body is waiting Waiting there in yearning belief How are we to fulfill The desire of our thoughts?  Calling to you, my water lily Budding for the two of us Here close by is a compliment The manu comes to deliver.  The Queen is listening The aroma of the scents comes together Mixes and rises upward So similar, so alike.\n', '\nTo catch the spirit in its wayward flight Through mazes manifold, what task supreme! For when to floods has grown the quiet stream, Much human skill must aid its rage to fight; And when wild winds invade the solemn night, Seems not man’s vaunted power but a dream? And still more futile, ay, we e’en must deem This quest to tame the soul, and guide aright Its restless wanderings, – to lure it back To shoals of calm. Full many a moan and sigh Attend the strife; till, effort merged in prayer, Oft uttered, clung to – when of strength the lack Seems direst – brings the answer to our cry: A gift from Him who lifts our ev’ry care.\n', '\nCover me with your everlasting arms,\n   Ye guardian giants of this solitude!\n   From the ill-sight of men, and from the rude,\nTumultuous din of yon wild world’s alarms!\nOh, knit your mighty limbs around, above,\n   And close me in for ever! let me dwell\n   With the wood spirits, in the darkest cell\nThat ever with your verdant locks ye wove.\n   The air is full of countless voices, joined\nIn one eternal hymn; the whispering wind,\nThe shuddering leaves, the hidden water springs,\nThe work-song of the bees, whose honeyed wings\nHang in the golden tresses of the lime,\nOr buried lie in purple beds of thyme.\n', '\nOft, when my lips I open to rehearse Thy wondrous spell of wisdom, and of power, And that my voice, and thy immortal verse, On listening ears, and hearts, I mingled pour, I shrink dismayed – and awful doth appear The vain presumption of my own weak deed; Thy glorious spirit seems to mine so near, That suddenly I tremble as I read – Thee an invisible auditor I fear: Oh, if it might be so, my master dear! With what beseeching would I pray to thee, To make me equal to my noble task, Succor from thee, how humbly would I ask, Thy worthiest works to utter worthily.\n', '\nTo those fair isles where crimson sunsets burn, We send a backward glance to gaze on thee, Brave Toussaint! thou was surely born to be A hero; thy proud spirit could but spurn  Each outrage on the race. Couldst thou unlearn The lessons taught by instinct? Nay! and we Who share the zeal that would make all men free, Must e’en with pride unto thy life-work turn. Soul-dignity was thine and purest aim; And ah! how sad that thou wast left to mourn In chains ’neath alien skies. On him, shame! shame! That mighty conqueror who dared to claim The right to bind thee. Him we heap with scorn, And noble patriot! guard with love thy name.\n', '\nDeath found strange beauty on that cherub brow, And dash’d it out. – There was a tint of rose O’er cheek and lip; – he touch’d the veins with ice, And the rose faded. – Forth from those blue eyes There spake a wistful tenderness, – a doubt Whether to grieve or sleep, which Innocence   Alone can wear. – With ruthless haste he bound The silken fringes of their curtaining lids Forever. – There had been a murmuring sound With which the babe would claim its mother’s ear, Charming her even to tears. – The spoiler set His seal of silence. – But there beam’d a smile, So fix’d and holy from that marble brow, –Death gazed and left it there; – he dared not steal The signet-ring of Heaven.\n', '\n\n\n\n‘How can the red men be forgotten, while so many of our states and territories, bays, lakes, and rivers, are indelibly stamped by names of their giving?’\n\n\n\nYe say they all have passed away,    That noble race and brave, That their light canoes have vanished    From off the crested wave; That ’mid the forests where they roamed    There rings no hunter shout, But their name is on your waters,    Ye may not wash it out.  ’Tis where Ontario’s billow    Like Ocean’s surge is curled, Where strong Niagara’s thunders wake    The echo of the world. Where red Missouri bringeth    Rich tribute from the west, And Rappahannock sweetly sleeps    On green Virginia’s breast.  Ye say their cone-like cabins,    That clustered o’er the vale, Have fled away like withered leaves    Before the autumn gale, But their memory liveth on your hills,    Their baptism on your shore, Your everlasting rivers speak    Their dialect of yore.  Old Massachusetts wears it,    Within her lordly crown, And broad Ohio bears it,    Amid his young renown; Connecticut hath wreathed it    Where her quiet foliage waves, And bold Kentucky breathed it hoarse    Through all her ancient caves.  Wachuset hides its lingering voice    Within his rocky heart, And Alleghany graves its tone    Throughout his lofty chart; Monadnock on his forehead hoar    Doth seal the sacred trust, Your mountains build their monument,    Though ye destroy their dust.  Ye call these red-browned brethren    The insects of an hour, Crushed like the noteless worm amid    The regions of their power; Ye drive them from their father’s lands,    Ye break of faith the seal, But can ye from the court of Heaven     Exclude their last appeal?  Ye see their unresisting tribes,    With toilsome step and slow, On through the trackless desert pass    A caravan of woe; Think ye the Eternal’s ear is deaf?    His sleepless vision dim? Think ye the soul’s blood may not cry    From that far land to him?\n', '\nLet me die on the prairie! and o’er my rude grave, In the soft breeze of summer the tall grass shall wave; I would breathe my last sigh as the bright hues of even Are melting away in the blue arch of Heaven.  Let me die on the prairie! unwept and unknown, I would pass from this fair Earth forgotten, alone;—Yet no! – there are hearts I have learned to revere, And methinks there is bliss in affection’s warm tear.  Oh, speak not to me of the green cypress shade; I would sleep where the bones of the Indian are laid, And the deer will bound o’er me with step light and free, And the carol of birds will my requiem be.  Let me die on the prairie! I have wished for it long; There floats in wild numbers the bold hunter’s song; ’Tis the spot of all others the dearest to me, And how sweet in its bosom my slumber will be!\n', '\nI should be happy with my lot: A wife and mother – is it not Enough for me to be content? What other blessing could be sent?  A quiet house, and homely ways, That make each day like other days; I only see Time’s shadow now Darken the hair on baby’s brow!  No world’s work ever comes to me, No beggar brings his misery; I have no power, no healing art With bruised soul or broken heart.  I read the poets of the age, ’Tis lotus-eating in a cage; I study Art, but Art is dead To one who clamors to be fed  With milk from Nature’s rugged breast, Who longs for Labor’s lusty rest. O foolish wish! I still should pine If any other lot were mine.\n', '\nOh! could I see as thou hast seen,    The garden of the west, When Spring in all her loveliness    Fair nature’s face has dressed.  The rolling prairie, vast and wild!    It hath a charm for me—Its tall grass waving to the breeze,    Like billows on the sea.  Say, hast thou chased the bounding deer    When smiled the rosy morn? Or hast thou listened to the sound    Of the merry hunter’s horn?  Once could the noble red-man call    That prairie wild his home;—   His cabin now in ruins laid,    He must an exile roam,  And thou at twilight’s pensive hour,    Perchance hast seen him weep;—Tread lightly o’er the hallowed spot,    For there his kindred sleep.  I envy not the opulent    His proud and lordly dome; Far happier is the pioneer    Who seeks a prairie home;—    Where no discordant notes are heard,    But all is harmony; Where soars aloft unfettered thought,    And the heart beats light and free.\n', '\nOne morn I left him in his bed; A moment after some one said, ‘Your child is dying – he is dead.’  We made him ready for his rest, Flowers in his hair, and on his breast His little hands together prest.  We sailed by night across the sea; So, floating from the world were we, Apart from sympathy, we Three.  The wild sea moaned, the black clouds spread Moving shadows on its bed, But one of us lay midship dead.  I saw his coffin sliding down The yellow sand in yonder town, Where I put on my sorrow’s crown.  And we returned; in this drear place Never to see him face to face, I thrust aside the living race.  Mothers, who mourn with me today, Oh, understand me, when I say, I cannot weep, I cannot pray;  I gaze upon a hidden store, His books, his toys, the clothes he wore, And cry, ‘Once more, to me, once more!’  Then take, from me, this simple verse, That you may know what I rehearse— A grief – your and my Universe!\n', '\nMorn on her rosy couch awoke,    Enchantment led the hour, And mirth and music drank the dews    That freshen’d Beauty’s flower, Then from her bower of deep delight,    I heard a young girl sing, ‘Oh, speak no ill of poetry,    For ’tis a holy thing.’  The Sun in noon-day heat rose high,    And on the heaving breast, I saw a weary pilgrim toil    Unpitied and unblest, Yet still in trembling measures flow’d    Forth from a broken string, ‘Oh, speak no ill of poetry,    For ’tis a holy thing.’  ’Twas night, and Death the curtains drew,    ’Mid agony severe, While there a willing spirit went    Home to a glorious sphere, Yet still it sigh’d, even when was spread   The waiting Angel’s wing, ‘Oh, speak no ill of poetry,    For ’tis a holy thing.’\n', '\nAn axe rang sharply ’mid those forest shades Which from creation toward the skies had tower’d In unshorn beauty. There, with vigorous arm Wrought a bold emigrant, and by his side His little son, with question and response, Beguiled the toil.                          ‘Boy, thou hast never seen Such glorious trees. Hark, when their giant trunks Fall, how the firm earth groans. Rememberest thou The mighty river, on whose breast we sail’d, So many days, on toward the setting sun? Our own Connecticut, compar’d to that, Was but a creeping stream.’                                          ‘Father, the brook That by our door went singing, where I launch’d My tiny boat, with my young playmates round, When school was o’er, is dearer far to me, Than all these bold, broad waters. To my eye They are as strangers. And those little trees My mother nutur’d in the garden bound, Of our first home, from whence the fragrant peach   Hung in its ripening gold, were fairer sure, Than this dark forest, shutting out the day.’ —‘What, ho! – my little girl,’ and with light stepA fairy creature hasted toward her sire, And setting down the basket that contain’d His noon-repast, look’d upward to his face With sweet, confiding smile.                                          ‘See, dearest, see, That bright-wing’d paroquet, and hear the song Of yon gay red-bird, echoing through the trees, Making rich music. Didst thou ever hear, In far New England, such a mellow tone?’ —‘I had a robin that did take the crumbs Each night and morning, and his chirping voice Still made me joyful, as I went to tend My snow-drops. I was always laughing then In that first home. I should be happier now Methinks, if I could find among these dells The same fresh violets.’                                    Slow night drew on, And round the rude hut of the Emigrant The wrathful spirit of the rising storm Spake bitter things. His weary children slept, And he, with head declin’d, sat listening long To the swoln waters of the Illinois, Dashing against their shores.                                           Starting he spake,—‘Wife! did I see thee brush away a tear? ’Twas even so. Thy heard was with the halls Of thy nativity. Their sparkling lights, Carpets, and sofas, and admiring guests, Befit thee better than these rugged walls Of shapeless logs, and this lone, hermit home.’    ‘No – no. All was so still around, methought Upon mine ear that echoes hymn did steal, Which ’mid the Church where erst we paid our vows, So tuneful peal’d. But tenderly thy voice Dissolv’d the illusion.’                                 And the gentle smile Lighting her brow, the fond caress that sooth’d Her waking infant, reassur’d his soul That wheresoe’er our best affections dwell, And strike a healthful root, is happiness. Content, and placid, to his rest he sank, But dreams, those wild magicians, that do play Such pranks when reason slumbers, tireless wrought Their will with him.                             Up rose the thronging mart Of his own native city, – roof and spire, All glittering bright, in fancy’s frost-work ray. The steed his boyhood nurtur’d proudly neigh’d, The favorite dog came frisking round his feet, With shrill and joyous bark, – familiar doors Flew open, – greeting hands with his were link’d In friendship’s grasp, – he heard the keen debate From congregated haunts, where mind with mind Doth blend and brighten, – and till morning rov’d ’Mid the loved scenery of his native land.\n', '\nHusband, today could you and I behold  The sun that brought us to our bridal morn Rising so splendid in the winter sky (We though fair spring returned), when we were wed; Could the shades vanish from these fifteen years, Which stand like columns guarding the approach To that great temple of the double soul That is as one – would you turn back, my dear, And, for the sake of Love’s mysterious dream, As old as Adam and as sweet as Eve, Take me, as I took you, and once more go Towards that goal which none of us have reached? Contesting battles which but prove a loss, The victor vanquished by the wounded one; Teaching each other sacrifice of self, True immolation to the marriage bond; Learning the joys of birth, the woe of death, Leaving in chaos all the hopes of life—Heart-broken, yet with courage pressing on For fame and fortune, artists needing both?

I\'ll seek a readier path, and go Where wisdom\'s surely taught below.    How deep yon azure dyes the sky, Where orbs of gold unnumbered lie, While through their ranks in silver pride The nether crescent seems to glide. The slumb\'ring breeze forgets to breathe, The lake is smooth and clear beneath, Where once again the spangled show Descends to meet our eyes below. The grounds, which on the right aspire, In dimness from the view retire: The left presents a place of graves, Whose wall the silent water laves. That steeple guides thy doubtful sight Among the livid gleams of night. There pass, with melancholy state, By all the solemn heaps of fate, And think, as softly-sad you tread Above the venerable dead, "Time was, like thee they life possessed, And time shall be, that thou shalt rest."    Those graves, with bending osier bound, That nameless heave the crumpled ground, Quick to the glancing thought disclose Where Toil and Poverty repose.    The flat smooth stones that bear a name, The chisel\'s slender help to fame (Which ere our set of friends decay Their frequent steps may wear away), A middle race of mortals own, Men, half ambitious, all unknown.    The marble tombs that rise on high, Whose dead in vaulted arches lie, Whose pillars swell with sculptured stones, Arms, angels, epitaphs and bones, These (all the poor remains of state) Adorn the rich, or praise the great; Who, while on earth in fame they live, Are senseless of the fame they give.    Ha! while I gaze, pale Cynthia fades, The bursting earth unveils the shades! All slow and wan, and wrapped with shrouds, They rise in visionary crowds, And all with sober accent cry, "Think, mortal, what it is to die."    Now from yon black and fun\'ral yew, That bathes the charnel-house with dew, Methinks I hear a voice begin (Ye ravens, cease your croaking din, Ye tolling clocks, no time resound O\'er the long lake and midnight ground); It sends a peal of hollow groans, Thus speaking from among the bones.    "When men my scythe and darts supply, How great a King of Fears am I! They view me like the last of things: They make, and then they dread, my stings. Fools! if you less provoked your fears, No more my spectre-form appears. Death\'s but a path that must be trod, If man would ever pass to God; A port of calms, a state of ease From the rough rage of swelling seas.    "Why then thy flowing sable stoles, Deep pendant cypress, mourning poles, Loose scarfs to fall athwart thy weeds, Long palls, drawn hearses, covered steeds, And plumes of black, that, as they tread, Nod o\'er the scutcheons of the dead?    "Nor can the parted body know, Nor wants the soul, these forms of woe. As men who long in prison dwell, With lamps that glimmer round the cell, Whene\'er their suffering years are run, Spring forth to greet the glitt\'ring sun: Such joy, though far transcending sense, Have pious souls at parting hence. On earth, and in the body placed, A few, and evil, years they waste; But when their chains are cast aside, See the glad scene unfolding wide, Clap the glad wing, and tow\'r away, And mingle with the blaze of day." \n', '\nSuch is the story made of stubbornness and a little air,a story sung by those who danced before the Lord in quiet.Who whirled and leapt.

The wind, whose tender whisper in the May    Set all the young blooms listening through th’ grove, Sits rustling in the faded boughs to-day    And makes his cold and unsuccessful love.  The rose has taken off her tire of red—    The mullein-stalk its yellow stars have lost, And the proud meadow-pink hangs down her head    Against earth’s chilly bosom, witched with frost.  The robin, that was busy all the June,    Before the sun had kissed the topmost bough, Catching our hearts up in his golden tune,    Has given place to the brown cricket now.  The very cock crows lonesomely at morn—    Each flag and fern the shrinking stream divides— Uneasy cattle low, and lambs forlorn    Creep to their strawy sheds with nettled sides.

And you take a stalk that is straight and long,    With an expert eye to its worthy points, And you think of the bubbling strains of song    That are bound between its pithy joints— Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle, With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.  Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow    O’er the yielding strings with a practiced hand! And the music’s flow never loud but low    Is the concert note of a fairy band. Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.  When the eve comes on and our work is done    And the sun drops down with a tender glance, With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,    Come the neighbor girls for the evening’s dance, And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle, More time than tune—from the corn-stalk fiddle.  Then brother Jabez takes the bow,    While Ned stands off with Susan Bland, Then Henry stops by Milly Snow    And John takes Nellie Jones’s hand, While I pair off with Mandy Biddle, And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle.  “Salute your partners,” comes the call,    “All join hands and circle round,” “Grand train back,” and “Balance all,”    Footsteps lightly spurn the ground, “Take your lady and balance down the middle” To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.  So the night goes on and the dance is o’er,    And the merry girls are homeward gone,   But I see it all in my sleep once more,    And I dream till the very break of dawn Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.  \n', '\nDare a mighty row in Zion an’ de debbil’s gittin’ high, An’ de saints done beat de sinners, a-cussin’ on de sly; What for it am? you reckon, well, I’ll tell you how it ’gin Twuz ’bout a mighty leetle thing, de linin’ ub de hymns.

To the quick rush of sickles, joyously     The reapers in the yellow wheat-fields sung, And bound the pale sheaves of the ripened rye,     When the first tassels of the maize were hung; That precious seed into the furrow cast Earliest in spring-time, crowns the harvest last.  Ever, when summer’s sun burns faint and dim,     And rare and few the pleasant days are given, When the sweet praise of our thankgiving hymn     Makes beautiful music in the ear of Heaven, I think of other harvests whence the sound Of singing comes not as the sheaves are bound.  Not where the rice-fields whiten in the sun,       And the warm South casts down her yellow fruit, Shout they the labors of the autumn done —         For there Oppression casts her deadly root, And they, who sow and gather in that clime Share not the treasures of the harvest-time.  God of the seasons! thou who didst ordain       Bread for the eater who shall plant the soil, How have they heard thee, who have forged the chain       And built the dungeon for the sons of toil? Burdening their hearts, not with the voice of prayer, But the dull cries of almost dumb despair.  They who would see that growth of wickedness       Planted where now the peaceful prairie waves, And make the green paths of our wilderness       Red with the torn and bleeding feet of slaves — Forbid it, Heaven! and let the sharp axe be Laid at the root of that most poison tree!  Let us behold its deadly leaves begin       A fainter shadow o’er the world to cast, And the long day that nursed its growth of sin       Wane to a sunset that shall be its last; So that the day-star, rising from the sea, Shall light a land whose children will be free!\n', '\nWhat is a home? A guarded space,    Wherein a few, unfairly blest, Shall sit together, face to face,    And bask and purr and be at rest?

Where Art may blossom strong and free,    And Pleasure furl her silken wing, And every laden moment be    A precious and peculiar thing?  And Past and Future, softly veiled    In hiding mists, shall float and lie Forgotten half, and unassailed    By either hope or memory?  While the luxurious Present weaves    Her perfumed spells untried, untrue, Broiders her garments, heaps her sheaves,    All for the pleasure of a few?  Can it be this, the longed-for thing    Which wanderers on the restless foam, Unsheltered beggars, birds on wing,     Aspire to, dream of, christen ‘Home’?  No. Art may bloom, and peace and bliss;    Grief may refrain and Death forget; But if there be no more than this,    The soul of home is wanting yet.  Dim image from far glory caught,    Fair type of fairer things to be, The true home rises in our thought,    A beacon set for men to see.  Its lamps burn freely in the night,    Its fire-glows unchidden shed Their cheering and abounding light    On homeless folk uncomforted.  Each sweet and secret thing within    Gives out a fragrance on the air,—    A thankful breath, sent forth to win    A little smile from others’ care.  The few, they bask in closer heat;    The many catch the further ray. Life higher seems, the world more sweet,    And hope and Heaven less far away.

Lo! here    The night is, and the deeds that make night fear; Wild winds and waters, and the sough of trees    Tossed in the tempest; wail of spirits banned,    Wandering, unhoused of clay, in the dim land; The incantation of the Sisters Three,    Nameless of deed and name – the mystic chords    Weird repetitions of the mystic words;    The mad, remorseful terrors of the Thane,    And bloody hands – which bloody must remain.    Last, the wild march; the battle hand to hand Of clashing arms, in awful harmony,    Sublimely grand, and terrible as grand! The clan-cries; the barbaric trumpetry;    And the one fateful note, that, throughout all,    Leads, follows, calls, compels, and holds in thrall.\n', '\nO foolish wisdom sought in books!    O aimless fret of household tasks! O chains that bind the hand and mind—      A fuller life my spirit asks!  For there the grand hills, summer-crowned,    Slope greenly downward to the seas; One hour of rest upon their breast    Were worth a year of days like these.  Their cool, soft green to ease the pain    Of eyes that ache o’er printed words; This weary noise – the city’s voice,    Lulled in the sound of bees and birds.  For Eden’s life within me stirs,    And scorns the shackles that I wear; The man-life grand – pure soul, strong hand,    The limb of steel, the heart of air!  And I could kiss, with longing wild,    Earth’s dear brown bosom, loved so much, A grass-blade fanned across my hand,    Would thrill me like a lover’s touch. The trees would talk with me; the flowers    Their hidden meanings each make known—   The olden lore revived once more,    When man’s and nature’s heart were one!  And as the pardoned pair might come    Back to the garden God first framed, And hear Him call at even-fall,    And answer, ‘Here am I,’ unshamed—    So I, from out these toils, wherein    The Eden-faith grows stained and dim, Would walk, a child, through nature’s wild,    And hear His voice and answer Him.\n', '\nO, come erlong, come erlong,       Wut’s de use er hol’in back;    O, hit it strong, er hit it strong,       Mek de ol’ flo’ ben’ an’ crack.

Mother, come back from the echoless shore, Take me again to your heart as of yore; Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care, Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair; Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;—      Rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!  Backward, flow backward, O tide of the years! I am so weary of toil and of tears,—      Toil without recompense, tears all in vain,—   Take them, and give me my childhood again! I have grown weary of dust and decay,—    Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away; Weary of sowing for others to reap;—    Rock me to sleep, mother – rock me to sleep!  Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue, Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you! Many a summer the grass has grown green, Blossomed and faded, our faces between: Yet, with strong yearning and passionate pain, Long I tonight for your presence again. Come from the silence so long and so deep;—    Rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!  Over my heart, in the days that are flown, No love like mother-love ever has shone; No other worship abides and endures,—       Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours: None like a mother can charm away pain From the sick soul and the world-weary brain. Slumber’s soft calms o’er my heavy lids creep;—      Rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!  Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold, Fall on your shoulders again as of old; Let it drop over my forehead tonight, Shading my faint eyes away from the light; For with its sunny-edged shadows once more Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore; Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;—    Rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!  Mother, dear mother, the years have been long Since I last listened your lullaby song: Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem Womanhood’s years have been only a dream. Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace, With your light lashes just sweeping my face, Never hereafter to wake or to weep;—      Rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!\n', '\n\n\n\n‘This is the key which was given by the angel Michael to Pali, and by Pali to Moses. If “thou canst read it, then shalt thou understand the words of men, … the whistling of birds, the language of date-trees, the unity of hearts, ... nay, even the thoughts of the rains.”’ Gleanings after the Talmud \n\n\n\nAh! could I read Schemhammphorasch, The wondrous keynote of the world, What voices could I always hear From tempests, with their black wings furled, That on the sudden west winds steer, And, muttering low their awful song, Or pealing through the mountains strong, Robe all the skies with sheeted fire; That pour from heaven a rushing river, That bid the hill-tops bow and quiver, Mad with some fierce and wild desire.  The dreadful anthem of the wind, That sweeps through forests as a plow, That lays the greensward heaped below, Would chant its meaning to my mind, And I could tell the tale to man In words that burn and glow with splendor; Then should the whole wide sky surrender Its hidden voice, its wondrous plan, Asleep since earliest time began; And all my soul, most like a blaze That burns the branches whence it springeth, Should flame to heaven in mightier lays Than any mortal poet singeth, If I could read Schemhammphorasch.  If I could read Schemhammphorasch, When little birds are softly singing, Or twitter from their greenwood nests, Where safe and still the mother rests; Or else, upon the glad wind springing, Send up their tender morning song; Then should I know their secret blisses, The thrill of life and love they feel When summer’s sun their bright heads kisses, Or summer’s winds about them steal. Or, listening to the early blossoms That are so fleeting and so fair, With perfume sighing from their bosoms Its incense on the gracious air, I think that I should hear a prayer So sweet, so patient, and so lowly, That mortal words most pure and rare Would scarce unveil its meaning holy. From forests whence the murmurous leaves Breathe their content in rustling quiver, Or droop when any rain-wind grieves, Or where some broad and brimming river O’erflowing to the mighty sea, Sings the proud joy of destiny, The glad acclaim of life and breath; The courage of confronted death; Ah! what a rapturous, glorious song Should seize with bliss this earthly throng, If I could read Schemhammphorasch!  If I could read Schemhammphorasch, Then should I know the souls of men, Too deep for any other ken; I could translate the silent speech Of glittering eye and knotted brow, Though still the wily tongue might teach A different script with voice and vow. The blood that runs in traitorous veins; The breath that gasps with hope or fear; The stifled sigh, the hidden tear; The death-pang of immortal pains, That hide their mortal agony, Would have their own low voice for me; Their tale of hate and misery, Their sob of passion and despair, Their sacred love, their frantic prayer. My soul would be the listening priest To hear confession far and near, And woe and want from first to least Would shriek its utterance in my ear. Ah, could I bear to live and hear These cries that heaven itself might flee, These terrors heaven alone may see, If I could read Schemhammphorasch?  If I could read Schemhammphorasch, My brain would burn with such a fire As lights the awful cherubim; My heart would burst with woe and ire, My flesh would shrivel and expire; Yea! God himself grow far and dim. I cannot hold the boundless sea In one small chalice lent to me; I cannot grasp the starry sky In one weak hand, and bid it lie Where I would have a canopy; I cannot hate and love together; I cannot poise the heavy world, Or hear its hiss through chaos hurled, Or stay the falling of a feather. No, not if Michael came once more, Standing upon the sea and shore, And held his right hand down to me, That I that awful word might see, And learn to read its lesson dread. My soul in dust would bow her head, Mine eyes would close, my lips would say, ‘Oh, Master! take thy gift away: Leave me to live my little day In peace and trust while yet I may. For could I live, or love, or pray, If I could read Schemhammphorasch?’\n', '\nMethought a sweet sound from the street uprose,—       And as I pause, and strive again to hear, ‘St Patrick’s Day’ draws softly to its close,    And ‘Jordan’s’ waves flow sweetly to my ear, What though from humble source the chorus floats?    Music is music, and I listen still; I have ‘an ear’, — ay, two! — Even jews-harp notes    Pass current with me, hear them where I will, A slight Italian boy, with jetty hair    Shading dark eyes, grinds out the melody, Pulverized music! — In his garb and air    I read of sunnier lands beyond the sea, And, dreaming, wander to a fairer clime, Recalled, too suddenly, by — ‘If you please, a dime!’\n', '\nI saw an eagle sweep to the sky— The Godlike! – seeking his place on high, With a strong, and wild, and rapid wing—A dark, and yet a dazzling thing; And his arching neck, his bristling crest, And the dark plumes quivering upon his breast; And his eye, bent up to each beam of light, Like a bright sword flash’d with a sword in fight.  I saw him rise o’er the forest trees; I saw his pinion ride the breeze; Beyond the clouds I watched him tower On his path of pride – his flight of power. I watched him wheeling, stern and lone, Where the keenest ray of the sun was thrown; Soaring, circling – bathed in light: Such was that desert eagle’s flight.  Suddenly, then, to my straining eye, I saw the strong wing slack on high; Falling, falling to earth once more; The dark breast covered with foam and gore; The dark eyes’ glory dim with pain; Sick to death with a sun-struck brain! Reeling down from that height divine, Eagle of heaven! such fall was thine!  Even so we see the sons of light, Up to the day-beam steer their flight; And the wing of genius cleaves the sky, As the clouds rush on when the winds are high: Then comes the hour of sudden dread—  Then is the blasting sunlight shed; And the gifted fall in their agony, Sund-struck eagle! to die like thee!\n', '\n\n\n\n‘Be not among wine-bibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh; for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.’  Proverbs, 23: 20, 21 \n\n\n\nI’ll tell you two fortunes, my fine little lad,       For you to accept or refuse. The one of them good, and the other one bad;       Now hear them, and say which you choose!  I see by my gift, within reach of your hand,       A fortune right fair to behold; A house and a hundred good acres of land,       With harvest fields yellow as gold.  I see a great orchard, the boughs hanging down       With apples of russet and red; I see droves of cattle, some white and brown,       But all of them sleek and well-fed.  I see doves and swallows about the barn doors,       See the fanning-mill whirling so fast, See men that are threshing the wheat on the floors;       And now the bright picture is past!  And I see, rising dismally up in the place       Of the beautiful house and the land, A man with a fire-red nose on his face,       And a little brown jug in his hand!  Oh! if you beheld him, my lad, you would wish       That he were less wretched to see; For his boot-toes, they gape like the mouth of a fish,       And his trousers are out at the knee!  In walking he staggers, now this way, now that,       And his eyes they stand out like a bug’s, And he wears an old coat and a battered-in hat,       And I think that the fault is the jug’s!  For our text says the drunkard shall come to be poor,       And drowsiness clothes men with rags; And he doesn’t look much like a man, I am sure,       Who has honest hard cash in his bags.  Now which will you choose? to be thrifty and snug,       And to be right side up with your dish; Or to go with your eyes like the eyes of a bug,       And your shoes like the mouth of a fish!\n', '\nI am weary of the working,    Weary of the long day’s heat; To thy comfortable bosom,    Wilt thou take me, spirit sweet?  Weary of the long, blind struggle    For a pathway bright and high,— Weary of the dimly dying    Hopes that never quite all die.  Weary searching a bad cipher    For a good that must be meant; Discontent with being weary,—    Weary with my discontent.  I am weary of the trusting    Where my trusts but torments prove; Wilt thou keep faith with me? wilt thou    Be my true and tender love?  I am weary drifting, driving    Like a helmless bark at sea; Kindly, comfortable spirit,    Wilt thou give thyself to me?  Give thy birds to sing me sonnets?    Give thy winds my cheeks to kiss? And thy mossy rocks to stand for    The memorials of our bliss?

The Fire Sermon \n  The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf\nClutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind\nCrosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.\nSweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\nThe river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,\nSilk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends\nOr other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.\nAnd their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;\nDeparted, have left no addresses.\nBy the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .\nSweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,\nSweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.\nBut at my back in a cold blast I hear\nThe rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear. \nA rat crept softly through the vegetation\nDragging its slimy belly on the bank\nWhile I was fishing in the dull canal\nOn a winter evening round behind the gashouse\nMusing upon the king my brother’s wreck\nAnd on the king my father’s death before him.\nWhite bodies naked on the low damp ground\nAnd bones cast in a little low dry garret,\nRattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.\nBut at my back from time to time I hear\nThe sound of horns and motors, which shall bring\nSweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.\nO the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter\nAnd on her daughter\nThey wash their feet in soda water Et O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!  \nTwit twit twit\nJug jug jug jug jug jug\nSo rudely forc’d.\nTereu \nUnreal City\nUnder the brown fog of a winter noon\nMr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant\nUnshaven, with a pocket full of currants\nC.i.f.

I sit and list to the steps in the street,     Going and coming, and coming and going, And the winds at my shutter they blow and beat;     ’Tis the middle of night and the clouds are snowing;     And the winds are bitterly beating and blowing.  I list to the steps as they come and go,     And list to the winds that are beating and blowing, And my heart sinks down so low, so low;     No step is stayed from me by the snowing,     Nor stayed by the wind so bitterly blowing.  I think of the ships that are out at sea,     Of the wheels in th’ cold, black waters turning; Not one of the ships beareth news to me,     And my head is sick, and my heart is yearning,     As I think of the wheels in the black waters turning.  Of the mother I think, by her sick baby’s bed,     Away in her cabin as lonesome and dreary, And little and low as the flax-breaker’s shed;     Of her patience so sweet, and her silence so weary,     With cries of the hungry wolf hid in the prairie.  I think of all things in the world that are sad;     Of children in homesick and comfortless places; Of prisons, of dungeons, of men that are mad;     Of wicked, unwomanly light in the faces     Of women that fortune has wronged with disgraces.  I think of a dear little sun-lighted head,     That came where no hand of us all could deliver; And crazed with the cruelest pain went to bed     Where the sheets were the foam-fretted waves of the river;     Poor darling! may God in his mercy forgive her.  The footsteps grow faint and more faint in the snow;     I put back the curtain in very despairing; The masts creak and groan as th’ winds come and go;     And the light in the light-house all weirdly is flaring;     But what glory is this, in the gloom of despairing!  I see at the window just over the street,     A maid in the lamplight her love-letter reading. Her red mouth is smiling, her news is so sweet;     And the heart in my bosom is cured of its bleeding,     As I look on the maiden her love-letter reading.  She has finished the letter, and folding it, kisses,     And hides it — a secret too sacred to know; And now in the hearth-light she softly undresses:     A vision of grace in the roseate glow,     I see her unbinding the braids of her tresses.  And now as she stoops to the ribbon that fastens     Her slipper, they tumble o’er shoulder and face; And now, as she patters in bare feet, she hastens     To gather them up in a fillet of lace;     And now she is gone, but in fancy I trace  The lavendered linen updrawn, the round arm     Half sunk in the counterpane’s broidered roses, Revealing the exquisite outline of form;     A willowy wonder of grace that reposes     Beneath the white counterpane, fleecy with roses.  I see the small hand lying over the heart,     Where the passionate dreams are so sweet in their sally; The fair little fingers they tremble and part,     As part to th’ warm waves the leaves of the lily,     And they play with her hand like the waves with the lily.  In white fleecy flowers, the queen o’ the flowers!     What to her is the world with its bad, bitter weather? Wide she opens her arms — ah, her world is not ours!     And now she has closed them and clasped them together —     What to her is our world, with its clouds and rough weather?  Hark! midnight! the winds and the snows blow and beat;     I drop down the curtain and say to my sorrow, Thank God for the window just over the street;     Thank God there is always a light whence to borrow     When darkness is darkest, and sorrow most sorrow.\n', "\nI couldn't have waited. By the time you return it would have rotted on the vine. So I cut the first tomato into eighths, salted the pieces in the dusk and found the flesh not mealy (like last year's) or bitter, even when I swallowed the green crown of the stem that made my throat feel dusty and warm.  Pah. I could have gagged on the sweetness. The miser accused by her red sums.

I’d say “Bah, I’ll get used to it.” And everything\n   around me ran. Things and people ran, ran – until I set myself to run like\n   crazy. But, it seems, I overdid. Because – I don’t know – something strange\n   happened in the end. First I’d see the corpse and then the murder. First\n   came the blood and then the blow and cry. And now, when I hear rain I don’t\n   know what’s waiting...  A:\n   “Why don’t they bury people standing up like archbishops?” – that’s what\n   she’d say to me.

The streets will\n   appear narrower and straighter than we imagined. The terraces with the\n   white television antennas. And all around the hills, and the kites – so close\n   we’ll just shave past them. Until one moment we’ll see the whole sea. On it\n   the souls will be leaving small white steams.  MN:\n   I have lifted my hand against the mountains, the dark and the demonic of\n   this world. I’ve asked love “Why?” and rolled her on the floor. War and war\n   and not one rag to hide deep in our things and forget. Who listens? Who\n   listened? Judges, priests, police, which is your country? One body is left me\n   and I give it. On it those who know cultivate the holy, as the gardeners in\n   Holland, tulips. And in it drown who never learned of sea or swimming... Flux\n   of the sea and you stars’ distant influx – stand by me!  A:\n   I have lifted my hand against the\n   unexorcised demons of the world\n   and from the place of illness I have exited\n   to the sun and to the light self-exiled!  MN:\n   And from too many storms I’ve exited\n   self among humans exiled!\n', "\nCarried her unprotesting out the door.\nKicked back the casket-stand. But it can't hold her,\nThat stuff and satin aiming to enfold her,\nThe lid's contrition nor the bolts before.\nOh oh. Too much. Too much. Even now, surmise,\nShe rises in the sunshine. There she goes,\nBack to the bars she knew and the repose\nIn love-rooms and the things in people's eyes.\nToo vital and too squeaking. Must emerge.\nEven now she does the snake-hips with a hiss,\nSlops the bad wine across her shantung, talks\nOf pregnancy, guitars and bridgework, walks\nIn parks or alleys, comes haply on the verge\nOf happiness, haply hysterics. Is.\n", '\nThe Year’s twelve daughters had in turn gone by, Of measured pace tho’ varying mien all twelve, Some froward, some sedater, some adorn’d For festival, some reckless of attire. The snow had left the mountain-top; fresh flowers Had withered in the meadow; fig and prune Hung wrinkling; the last apple glow’d amid Its freckled leaves; and weary oxen blinkt Between the trodden corn and twisted vine, Under whose bunches stood the empty crate, To creak ere long beneath them carried home. This was the season when twelve months before, O gentle Hamadryad, true to love! Thy mansion, thy dim mansion in the wood Was blasted and laid desolate: but none Dared violate its precincts, none dared pluck The moss beneath it, which alone remain’d Of what was thine.                              Old Thallinos sat mute In solitary sadness. The strange tale (Not until Rhaicos died, but then the whole) Echion had related, whom no force Could ever make look back upon the oaks. The father said “Echion! thou must weigh, Carefully, and with steady hand, enough (Although no longer comes the store as once!) Of wax to burn all day and night upon That hollow stone where milk and honey lie: So may the Gods, so may the dead, be pleas’d!” Thallinos bore it thither in the morn, And lighted it and left it.                                            First of those Who visited upon this solemn day The Hamadryad’s oak, were Rhodope And Acon; of one age, one hope, one trust. Graceful was she as was the nymph whose fate She sorrowed for: he slender, pale, and first  Lapt by the flame of love: his father’s lands Were fertile, herds lowed over them afar. Now stood the two aside the hollow stone And lookt with stedfast eyes toward the oak Shivered and black and bare.                                             “May never we Love as they loved!” said Acon. She at this Smiled, for he said not what he meant to say, And thought not of its bliss, but of its end. He caught the flying smile, and blusht, and vow’d Nor time nor other power, whereto the might Of love hath yielded and may yield again, Should alter his.                             The father of the youth Wanted not beauty for him, wanted not Song, that could lift earth’s weight from off his heart, Discretion, that could guide him thro’ the world, Innocence, that could clear his way to heaven; Silver and gold and land, not green before The ancestral gate, but purple under skies Bending far off, he wanted for his heir.         Fathers have given life, but virgin heart They never gave; and dare they then control Or check it harshly? dare they break a bond Girt round it by the holiest Power on high?         Acon was grieved, he said, grieved bitterly, But Acon had complied . . ’twas dutiful!         Crush thy own heart, Man! Man! but fear to wound The gentler, that relies on thee alone, By thee created, weak or strong by thee; Touch it not but for worship; watch before Its sanctuary; nor leave it till are closed The temple-doors and the last lamp is spent.         Rhodope, in her soul’s waste solitude, Sate mournful by the dull-resounding sea, Often not hearing it, and many tears Had the cold breezes hardened on her cheek. Meanwhile he sauntered in the wood of oaks, Nor shun’d to look upon the hollow stone That held the milk and honey, nor to lay His plighted hand where recently ’twas laid Opposite hers, when finger playfully Advanced and pusht back finger, on each side. He did not think of this, as she would do If she were there alone.                                       The day was hot; The moss invited him; it cool’d his cheek, It cool’d his hands; he thrust them into it And sank to slumber. Never was there dream Divine as his. He saw the Hamadryad. She took him by the arm and led him on Along a valley, where profusely grew The smaller lilies with their pendent bells, And, hiding under mint, chill drosera, The violet shy of butting cyclamen, The feathery fern, and, browser of moist banks, Her offspring round her, the soft strawberry; The quivering spray of ruddy tamarisk, The oleander’s light-hair’d progeny Breathing bright freshness in each other’s face, And graceful rose, bending her brow, with cup  Of fragrance and of beauty, boon for Gods. The fragrance fill’d his breast with such delight His senses were bewildered, and he thought He saw again the face he most had loved. He stopt: the Hamadryad at his side Now stood between; then drew him farther off: He went, compliant as before: but soon Verdure had ceast: altho’ the ground was smooth, Nothing was there delightful. At this change He would have spoken, but his guide represt All questioning, and said,                                          “Weak youth! what brought Thy footstep to this wood, my native haunt, My life-long residence? this bank, where first I sate with him . . the faithful (now I know, Too late!) the faithful Rhaicos. Haste thee home; Be happy, if thou canst; but come no more Where those whom death alone could sever, died.”         He started up: the moss whereon he slept Was dried and withered: deadlier paleness spread Over his cheek; he sickened: and the sire Had land enough; it held his only son.\n', '\nI have been one acquainted with the night.\nI have walked out in rain—and back in rain.\nI have outwalked the furthest city light. \nI have looked down the saddest city lane.\nI have passed by the watchman on his beat\nAnd dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain. \nI have stood still and stopped the sound of feet\nWhen far away an interrupted cry\nCame over houses from another street, \nBut not to call me back or say good-bye;\nAnd further still at an unearthly height,\nOne luminary clock against the sky \nProclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. \nI have been one acquainted with the night.\n', '\nWe chose this animal to be our pet.\nHis indifference allowed us to sleep. \nCat, who made your ears bend back,\nwho made you lazy as quick? \nWho made you work?\nIt is a wonder any sun is left. \nStill it is always so abrupt.\nSleep like an umbrella going up, \nclumsy like a broken umbrella coming down,\nthis waking, and into what? \nI did not ask to be afraid.\nI did not ask for pleasure, but there it was, \nit exfoliated at its own leisure,\ngrew until it was all that was— \nThe brief interruption of who I am\ninterrupts and punctuates the day \nI always assumed that I would share—\nCat who cut the sun down from the sky \nand then responsible put it up again?\nThere must be one of us that you prefer.\n', '\nWind whistling, as it does   \nin winter, and I think   \nnothing of it until \nit snaps a shutter off\nher bedroom window, spins   \nit over the roof and down \nto crash on the deck in back,   \nlike something out of Oz.\nWe look up, stunned—then glad \nto be safe and have a story,   \ncharacters in a fable   \nwe only half-believe. \nLook, in my surprise\nI somehow split a wall,   \nthe last one in the house \nwe’re making of gingerbread.   \nWe’ll have to improvise:   \nprop the two halves forward \nlike an open double door   \nand with a tube of icing   \ncement them to the floor. \nFive days until Christmas,\nand the house cannot be closed.   \nWhen she peers into the cold \ninterior we’ve exposed,   \nshe half-expects to find   \nthree magi in the manger, \na mother and her child.   \nShe half-expects to read   \non tablets of gingerbread \na line or two of Scripture,   \nas she has every morning   \ninside a dated shutter \non her Advent calendar.   \nShe takes it from the mantel   \nand coaxes one fingertip \nunder the perforation,   \nas if her future hinges\non not tearing off the flap \nunder which a thumbnail picture   \nby Raphael or Giorgione,   \nHans Memling or David \nof apses, niches, archways,   \ncradles a smaller scene   \nof a mother and her child, \nof the lidded jewel-box   \nof Mary’s downcast eyes.

Cor. xv. 51, 52, 53.      XXI Now glory be to the Most High,    United praises given, By all on earth, incessantly,    And all the host of heav’n.                                                                   Psal. cl. 6.  \n', '\nI  Leaguered in fire The wild black promontories of the coast extend Their savage silhouettes; The sun in universal carnage sets, And, halting higher, The motionless storm-clouds mass their sullen threats, Like an advancing mob in sword-points penned, That, balked, yet stands at bay. Mid-zenith hangs the fascinated day In wind-lustrated hollows crystalline, A wan Valkyrie whose wide pinions shine Across the ensanguined ruins of the fray, And in her hand swings high o’erhead, Above the waster of war, The silver torch-light of the evening star Wherewith to search the faces of the dead.                                      II  Lagooned in gold, Seem not those jetty promontories rather The outposts of some ancient land forlorn, Uncomforted of morn, Where old oblivions gather, The melancholy unconsoling fold Of all things that go utterly to death And mix no more, no more With life’s perpetually awakening breath? Shall Time not ferry me to such a shore, Over such sailless seas, To walk with hope’s slain importunities In miserable marriage? Nay, shall not All things be there forgot, Save the sea’s golden barrier and the black Close-crouching promontories? Dead to all shames, forgotten of all glories, Shall I not wander there, a shadow’s shade, A spectre self-destroyed, So purged of all remembrance and sucked back Into the primal void, That should we on the shore phantasmal meet I should not know the coming of your feet?\n', "\nHome, thou return'st from Thames, whose Naiads long     Have seen thee ling'ring, with a fond delay,     Mid those soft friends, whose hearts, some future day, Shall melt, perhaps, to hear thy tragic song. Go, not unmindful of that cordial youth,     Whom, long endear'd, thou leav'st by Lavant's side; Together let us wish him lasting truth,     And joy untainted with his destined bride. Go! nor regardless, while these numbers boast     My short-lived bliss, forget my social name; But think far off how, on the southern coast,     I met thy friendship with an equal flame! Fresh to that soil thou turn'st, whose ev'ry vale     Shall prompt the poet, and his song demand: To thee thy copious subjects ne'er shall fail;     Thou need'st but take the pencil to thy hand, And paint what all believe who own thy genial land.  There must thou wake perforce thy Doric quill,     'Tis Fancy's land to which thou sett'st thy feet;       Where still, 'tis said, the fairy people meet Beneath each birken shade, on mead or hill. There each trim lass that skims the milky store     To the swart tribes their creamy bowl allots; By night they sip it round the cottage-door,     While airy minstrels warble jocund notes. There ev'ry herd, by sad experience, knows     How, winged with fate, their elf-shot arrows fly, When the sick ewe her summer food forgoes,     Or, stretched on earth, the heart-smit heifers lie. Such airy beings awe th' untutored swain:     Nor thou, though learned, his homelier thoughts neglect; Let thy sweet muse the rural faith sustain;     These are the themes of simple, sure effect, That add new conquests to her boundless reign.     And fill with double force her heart-commanding strain.  Ev'n yet preserv'd, how often may'st thou hear,     Where to the pole the Boreal mountains run,     Taught by the father to his list'ning son Strange lays, whose pow'r had charmed a Spenser's ear. At ev'ry pause, before thy mind possessed,     Old Runic bards shall seem to rise around, With uncouth lyres, in many-coloured vest,     Their matted hair with boughs fantastic crowned: Whether thou bidd'st the well-taught hind repeat     The choral dirge that mourns some chieftain brave, When ev'ry shrieking maid her bosom beat,     And strewed with choicest herbs his scented grave; Or whether, sitting in the shepherd's shiel,     Thou hear'st some sounding tale of war's alarms; When, at the bugle's call, with fire and steel,     The sturdy clans pour'd forth their bonny swarms, And hostile brothers met to prove each other's arms.  'Tis thine to sing how, framing hideous spells,     In Skye's lone isle the gifted wizard seer,     Lodged in the wintry cave with [          ] Or in the depth of Uist's dark forest dwells: How they, whose sight such dreary dreams engross,     With their own visions oft astonished droop, When o'er the wat'ry strath or quaggy moss     They see the gliding ghosts unbodied troop. Or if in sports, or on the festive green,     Their [      ] glance some fated youth descry, Who, now perhaps in lusty vigour seen     And rosy health, shall soon lamented die. For them the viewless forms of air obey,     Their bidding heed, and at their beck repair. They know what spirit brews the stormful day,     And heartless, oft like moody madness stare To see the phantom train their secret work prepare.  [Stanza 5 and the first eight lines of stanza 6 are missing]  What though far off, from some dark dell espied,     His glimm'ring mazes cheer th' excursive sight, Yet turn, ye wand'rers, turn your steps aside,     Nor trust the guidance of that faithless light! For watchful, lurking mid th' unrustling reed,     At those mirk hours the wily monster lies, And listens oft to hear the passing steed,     And frequent round him rolls his sullen eyes, If chance his savage wrath may some weak wretch surprise.  Ah, luckless swain, o'er all unblest indeed!     Whom late bewildered in the dank, dark fen,     Far from his flocks and smoking hamlet then! To that sad spot [            ]: On him, enraged, the fiend, in angry mood,     Shall never look with pity's kind concern, But instant, furious, raise the whelming flood       O'er its drowned banks, forbidding all return. Or, if he meditate his wished escape     To some dim hill that seems uprising near, To his faint eye the grim and grisly shape,     In all its terrors clad, shall wild appear. Meantime, the wat'ry surge shall round him rise,     Poured sudden forth from ev'ry swelling source. What now remains but tears and hopeless sighs?     His fear-shook limbs have lost their youthly force, And down the waves he floats, a pale and breathless corse.  For him in vain his anxious wife shall wait,     Or wander forth to meet him on his way;     For him in vain, at to-fall of the day, His bairns shall linger at th' unclosing gate. Ah, ne'er shall he return! Alone, if night     Her travell'd limbs in broken slumbers steep, With drooping willows dressed, his mournful sprite     Shall visit sad, perhaps, her silent sleep: Then he, perhaps, with moist and watry hand,     Shall fondly seem to press her shudd'ring cheek, And with his blue swoll'n face before her stand,     And, shiv'ring cold, these piteous accents speak: 'Pursue, dear wife, thy daily toils pursue     At dawn or dusk, industrious as before; Nor e'er of me one hapless thought renew,     While I lie welt'ring on the osiered shore, Drown'd by the kaelpie's wrath, nor e'er shall aid thee more!'  Unbounded is thy range; with varied style     Thy Muse may, like those feath'ry tribes which spring     From their rude rocks, extend her skirting wing Round the moist marge of each cold Hebrid isle, To that hoar pile which still its ruin shows:     In whose small vaults a pigmy-folk is found, Whose bones the delver with his spade upthrows,     And culls them, wond'ring, from the hallowed ground! Or thither, where beneath the show'ry west     The mighty kings of three fair realms are laid; Once foes, perhaps, together now they rest.     No slaves revere them, and no wars invade: Yet frequent now, at midnight's solemn hour,     The rifted mounds their yawning cells unfold, And forth the monarchs stalk with sov'reign pow'r,     In pageant robes, and wreathed with sheeny gold, And on their twilight tombs aerial council hold.  But, O! o'er all, forget not Kilda's race,     On whose bleak rocks, which brave the wasting tides,     Fair Nature's daughter, Virtue, yet abides! Go, just as they, their blameless manners trace! Then to my ear transmit some gentle song,     Of those whose lives are yet sincere and plain, Their bounded walks the rugged cliffs along,     And all their prospect but the wintry main. With sparing temp'rance, at the needful time,     They drain the sainted spring, or, hunger-pressed, Along th' Atlantic rock undreading climb,     And of its eggs despoil the solan's nest. Thus blest in primal innocence they live,     Sufficed and happy with that frugal fare Which tasteful toil and hourly danger give.     Hard is their shallow soil, [      ] and bare; Nor ever vernal bee was heard to murmur there!  Nor need'st thou blush, that such false themes engage     Thy gentle mind, of fairer stores possessed;     For not alone they touch the village breast, But filled in elder time th' historic page. There Shakespeare's self, with ev'ry garland crowned, In musing hour, his Wayward Sisters found,     And with their terrors dressed the magic scene. From them he sung, when mid his bold design,     Before the Scot afflicted and aghast, The shadowy kings of Banquo's fated line     Through the dark cave in gleamy pageant passed. Proceed, nor quit the tales which, simply told,     Could once so well my answ'ring bosom pierce; Proceed, in forceful sounds and colours bold     The native legends of thy land rehearse; To such adapt thy lyre and suit thy pow'rful verse. In scenes like these, which, daring to depart     From sober truth, are still to nature true,     And call forth fresh delight to Fancy's view, Th' heroic Muse employed her Tasso's art! How have I trembled when, at Tancred's stroke,     Its gushing blood the gaping cypress poured; When each live plant with mortal accents spoke,     And the wild blast up-heaved the vanished sword! How have I sat, where piped the pensive wind,     To hear his harp, by British Fairfax strung, Prevailing poet, whose undoubting mind     Believed the magic wonders which he sung! Hence at each sound imagination glows; Hence his warm lay with softest sweetness flows;     Melting it flows, pure, num'rous, strong, and clear, And fills th' impassioned heart, and lulls th' harmonious ear.  All hail, ye scenes that o'er my soul prevail,     Ye [       ] friths and lakes which, far away,     Are by smooth Annan filled or past'ral Tay, Or Don's romantic springs, at distance, hail! The time shall come when I, perhaps, may tread     Your lowly glens, o'erhung with spreading broom, Or, o'er your stretching heaths by Fancy led: Then will I dress once more the faded bow'r,     Where Jonson sat in Drummond's [      ] shade; Or crop from Tiviot's dale each [       ]     And mourn on Yarrow's banks [       ] Meantime, ye pow'rs, that on the plains which bore     The cordial youth, on Lothian's plains attend, Where'er he dwell, on hill or lowly muir,     To him I lose, your kind protection lend, And, touched with love like mine, preserve my absent friend \n", '\nMy dear, you are the high-speed car chase, and I,   \nI am the sheet of glass being carefully carried   \nacross the street by two employees of Acme Moving   \nwho have not parked on the right side   \nbecause the plot demands that they make   \nthe perilous journey across traffic,   \nand so they are cursing as rehearsed   \nas they angle me into the street, acting as if   \nthey intend to get me to the department store, as if   \nI will ever take my place as the display window, ever clear   \nthe way for a special exhibit at Christmas, or be Windexed   \nonce a day, or even late at night, be pressed against   \nby a couple who can’t make it back to his place,   \nand so they angle me into the street, a bright lure,   \na provocative claim, their teaser, and indeed   \nyou can’t resist my arguments, fatally flawed   \nthough they are, so you come careening to but and butt   \nand rebut, you come careening, you being   \nboth cars, both chaser and chased, both good and bad, both   \ndone up with bullets that haven’t yet done you in.   \nI know I’m done for: there’s only one street   \non this set and you’ve got a stubborn streak a mile long.   \nI can smell the smoke already.   \n                                                No matter, I’d rather shatter   \nthan be looked through all day.

Successful women who have won their way Alone, with strength of their unaided arm, Or helped by friends, or softly climbing up By the sweet aid of ‘woman’s influence’; Successful any way, and caring naught For any other woman’s unsuccess, —  These tell us they have all the rights they want.  Religious women of the feebler sort, —  Not the religion of a righteous world, A free, enlightened, upward-reaching world, But the religion that considers life As something to back out of! — whose ideal Is to renounce, submit, and sacrifice, Counting on being patted on the head And given a high chair when they get to heaven, — These tell us they have all the rights they want.  Ignorant women — college-bred sometimes, But ignorant of life’s realities And principles of righteous government, And how the privileges they enjoy Were won with blood and tears by those before —  Those they condemn, whose ways they now oppose; Saying, ‘Why not let well enough alone? Our world is very pleasant as it is,’ —  These tell us they have all the rights they want.  And selfish women, — pigs in petticoats, — Rich, poor, wise, unwise, top or bottom round, But all sublimely innocent of thought, And guiltless of ambition, save the one Deep, voiceless aspiration — to be fed! These have no use for rights or duties more. Duties today are more than they can meet, And law insures their right to clothes and food, —  These tell us they have all the rights they want.  And, more’s the pity, some good women, too; Good conscientious women, with ideas; Who think — or think they think — that woman’s cause Is best advanced by letting it alone; That she somehow is not a human thing, And not to be helped on by human means, Just added to humanity — an ‘L’ — A wing, a branch, an extra, not mankind, —  These tell us they have all the rights they want.  And out of these has come a monstrous thing, A strange, down-sucking whirlpool of disgrace, Women uniting against womanhood, And using that great name to hide their sin!

privileged, you know,\nTo adopt a new and different plan,—\n To lay aside the hoe.\nHe took the lead in politics, \n And handled all the “notes,”—\nFor he was up to all the tricks\n That gather in the votes;\nFor when the war came to a close\n And negroes “took a stand,”\nYoung Bartow with the current rose,\n The foremost in command.\nHis voice upon the “stump” was heard;\n He “Yankeedom” did prate;\nThe “carpet-bagger” he revered;\n The Southerner did hate.\nHe now was greater than the lord\n Who used to call him slave,\nFor he was on the “County Board,”\n With every right to rave.\nBut this amazing run of luck\n Was far too good to stand;\nAnd soon the chivalrous “Ku-Klux”\n Rose in the Southern land.\nThen Bartow got a little note,—\n ’Twas very queerly signed,—\nIt simply told him not to vote,\n Or be to death resigned.\nYoung Bartow thought this little game\n Was very fine and nice\nTo bring his courage rare to shame\n And knowledge of justice.\n“What right have they to think I fear?”\n He to himself did say.\n“Dare they presume that I do care\n How loudly they do bray?\n“This is my home, and here I die,\n Contending for my right!\nThen let them come! My colors fly!\nI’m ready now to fight!  “Let those who think that Bartow Black,—\n An office-holder, too!—\nWill to the cowards show his back,\n Their vain presumption rue!”\nBartow pursued his office game,\n And made the money, too,\nBut home at nights he wisely came\n And played the husband true.\nWhen they had got their subject tame,\n And well-matured their plan, \nThey at the hour of midnight came,\n And armed was every man!\nThey numbered fifty Southern sons,\n And masked was every face;\nAnd Winfield rifles were their guns,—\n You could that plainly trace.\nOne Southern brave did have a key,\n An entrance quick to make;\nThey entered all; but meek, you see,\n Their victim not to wake!\nThey reached his room! He was in bed,—\n His wife was by his side!\nThey struck a match above his head,—\n His eyes he opened wide!\nPoor Bartow could not reach his gun,\n Though quick his arm did stretch,\nFor twenty bullets through him spun,\n That stiffly laid the wretch.\nAnd then they rolled his carcass o’er,\n And filled both sides with lead;\nAnd then they turned it on the floor,\n And shot away his head!\nEre Black his bloody end did meet\n His wife had swooned away;\nThe Southern braves did now retreat,—\n There was no need to stay!\n\n', '\nLO, praise of the prowess of people-kings\nof spear-armed Danes, in days long sped,\nwe have heard, and what honor the athelings won!\nOft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes,\nfrom many a tribe, the mead-bench tore,\nawing the earls. Since erst he lay\nfriendless, a foundling, fate repaid him:\nfor he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve,\ntill before him the folk, both far and near,\nwho house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,\ngave him gifts: a good king he!\nTo him an heir was afterward born,\na son in his halls, whom heaven sent\nto favor the folk, feeling their woe\nthat erst they had lacked an earl for leader\nso long a while; the Lord endowed him,\nthe Wielder of Wonder, with world’s renown.\nFamed was this Beowulf: far flew the boast of him,\nson of Scyld, in the Scandian lands.\nSo becomes it a youth to quit him well\nwith his father’s friends, by fee and gift,\nthat to aid him, aged, in after days,\ncome warriors willing, should war draw nigh,\nliegemen loyal: by lauded deeds\nshall an earl have honor in every clan.\nForth he fared at the fated moment,\nsturdy Scyld to the shelter of God.\nThen they bore him over to ocean’s billow,\nloving clansmen, as late he charged them,\nwhile wielded words the winsome Scyld,\nthe leader beloved who long had ruled....\nIn the roadstead rocked a ring-dight vessel,\nice-flecked, outbound, atheling’s barge:\nthere laid they down their darling lord\non the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings,   \nby the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure\nfetched from far was freighted with him.\nNo ship have I known so nobly dight\nwith weapons of war and weeds of battle,\nwith breastplate and blade: on his bosom lay\na heaped hoard that hence should go\nfar o’er the flood with him floating away.\nNo less these loaded the lordly gifts,\nthanes’ huge treasure, than those had done\nwho in former time forth had sent him\nsole on the seas, a suckling child.\nHigh o’er his head they hoist the standard,\na gold-wove banner; let billows take him,\ngave him to ocean. Grave were their spirits,\nmournful their mood. No man is able\nto say in sooth, no son of the halls,\nno hero ‘neath heaven, — who harbored that freight!\nNow Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings,\nleader beloved, and long he ruled\nin fame with all folk, since his father had gone\naway from the world, till awoke an heir,\nhaughty Healfdene, who held through life,\nsage and sturdy, the Scyldings glad.\nThen, one after one, there woke to him,\nto the chieftain of clansmen, children four:\nHeorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave;\nand I heard that — was —’s queen,\nthe Heathoscylfing’s helpmate dear.\nTo Hrothgar was given such glory of war,\nsuch honor of combat, that all his kin\nobeyed him gladly till great grew his band\nof youthful comrades. It came in his mind\nto bid his henchmen a hall uprear,\na master mead-house, mightier far\nthan ever was seen by the sons of earth,\nand within it, then, to old and young\nhe would all allot that the Lord had sent him,\nsave only the land and the lives of his men.\nWide, I heard, was the work commanded,\nfor many a tribe this mid-earth round,\nto fashion the folkstead. It fell, as he ordered,\nin rapid achievement that ready it stood there,\nof halls the noblest: Heorot   he named it\nwhose message had might in many a land.\nNot reckless of promise, the rings he dealt,\ntreasure at banquet: there towered the hall,\nhigh, gabled wide, the hot surge waiting\nof furious flame.   Nor far was that day\nwhen father and son-in-law stood in feud\nfor warfare and hatred that woke again.   \nWith envy and anger an evil spirit\nendured the dole in his dark abode,\nthat he heard each day the din of revel\nhigh in the hall: there harps rang out,\nclear song of the singer. He sang who knew\ntales of the early time of man,\nhow the Almighty made the earth,\nfairest fields enfolded by water,\nset, triumphant, sun and moon\nfor a light to lighten the land-dwellers,\nand braided bright the breast of earth\nwith limbs and leaves, made life for all\nof mortal beings that breathe and move.\nSo lived the clansmen in cheer and revel\na winsome life, till one began\nto fashion evils, that field of hell.\nGrendel this monster grim was called,\nmarch-riever mighty, in moorland living,\nin fen and fastness; fief of the giants\nthe hapless wight a while had kept\nsince the Creator his exile doomed.\nOn kin of Cain was the killing avenged\nby sovran God for slaughtered Abel.\nIll fared his feud, and far was he driven,\nfor the slaughter’s sake, from sight of men.\nOf Cain awoke all that woful breed,\nEtins   and elves and evil-spirits,\nas well as the giants that warred with God\nweary while: but their wage was paid them!\nWENT he forth to find at fall of night\nthat haughty house, and heed wherever\nthe Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone.\nFound within it the atheling band\nasleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow,\nof human hardship. Unhallowed wight,\ngrim and greedy, he grasped betimes,\nwrathful, reckless, from resting-places,\nthirty of the thanes, and thence he rushed\nfain of his fell spoil, faring homeward,\nladen with slaughter, his lair to seek.\nThen at the dawning, as day was breaking,\nthe might of Grendel to men was known;\nthen after wassail was wail uplifted,\nloud moan in the morn. The mighty chief,\natheling excellent, unblithe sat,\nlabored in woe for the loss of his thanes,\nwhen once had been traced the trail of the fiend,\nspirit accurst: too cruel that sorrow,\ntoo long, too loathsome. Not late the respite;\nwith night returning, anew began\nruthless murder; he recked no whit,\nfirm in his guilt, of the feud and crime.\nThey were easy to find who elsewhere sought\nin room remote their rest at night,\nbed in the bowers,   when that bale was shown,\nwas seen in sooth, with surest token, —\nthe hall-thane’s   hate. Such held themselves\nfar and fast who the fiend outran!\nThus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill\none against all; until empty stood\nthat lordly building, and long it bode so.\nTwelve years’ tide the trouble he bore,\nsovran of Scyldings, sorrows in plenty,\nboundless cares. There came unhidden\ntidings true to the tribes of men,\nin sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel\nharassed Hrothgar, what hate he bore him,\nwhat murder and massacre, many a year,\nfeud unfading, — refused consent\nto deal with any of Daneland’s earls,\nmake pact of peace, or compound for gold:\nstill less did the wise men ween to get\ngreat fee for the feud from his fiendish hands.\nBut the evil one ambushed old and young\ndeath-shadow dark, and dogged them still,\nlured, or lurked in the livelong night\nof misty moorlands: men may say not\nwhere the haunts of these Hell-Runes   be.\nSuch heaping of horrors the hater of men,\nlonely roamer, wrought unceasing,\nharassings heavy.

Many nobles\nsat assembled, and searched out counsel\nhow it were best for bold-hearted men\nagainst harassing terror to try their hand.\nWhiles they vowed in their heathen fanes\naltar-offerings, asked with words   \nthat the slayer-of-souls would succor give them\nfor the pain of their people. Their practice this,\ntheir heathen hope; ‘twas Hell they thought of\nin mood of their mind.

But well for him\nthat after death-day may draw to his Lord,\nand friendship find in the Father’s arms!\nTHUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene\nwith the woe of these days; not wisest men\nassuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish,\nloathly and long, that lay on his folk,\nmost baneful of burdens and bales of the night.\nThis heard in his home Hygelac’s thane,\ngreat among Geats, of Grendel’s doings.\nHe was the mightiest man of valor\nin that same day of this our life,\nstalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker\nhe bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he,\nfar o’er the swan-road he fain would seek,\nthe noble monarch who needed men!\nThe prince’s journey by prudent folk\nwas little blamed, though they loved him dear;\nthey whetted the hero, and hailed good omens.\nAnd now the bold one from bands of Geats\ncomrades chose, the keenest of warriors\ne’er he could find; with fourteen men\nthe sea-wood   he sought, and, sailor proved,\nled them on to the land’s confines.\nTime had now flown;   afloat was the ship,\nboat under bluff. On board they climbed,\nwarriors ready; waves were churning\nsea with sand; the sailors bore\non the breast of the bark their bright array,\ntheir mail and weapons: the men pushed off,\non its willing way, the well-braced craft.\nThen moved o’er the waters by might of the wind\nthat bark like a bird with breast of foam,\ntill in season due, on the second day,\nthe curved prow such course had run\nthat sailors now could see the land,\nsea-cliffs shining, steep high hills,\nheadlands broad. Their haven was found,\ntheir journey ended. Up then quickly\nthe Weders’   clansmen climbed ashore,\nanchored their sea-wood, with armor clashing\nand gear of battle: God they thanked\nfor passing in peace o’er the paths of the sea.\nNow saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman,\na warden that watched the water-side,\nhow they bore o’er the gangway glittering shields,\nwar-gear in readiness; wonder seized him\nto know what manner of men they were.\nStraight to the strand his steed he rode,\nHrothgar’s henchman; with hand of might\nhe shook his spear, and spake in parley.\n“Who are ye, then, ye armed men,\nmailed folk, that yon mighty vessel\nhave urged thus over the ocean ways,\nhere o’er the waters? A warden I,\nsentinel set o’er the sea-march here,\nlest any foe to the folk of Danes\nwith harrying fleet should harm the land.\nNo aliens ever at ease thus bore them,\nlinden-wielders:   yet word-of-leave\nclearly ye lack from clansmen here,\nmy folk’s agreement. — A greater ne’er saw I\nof warriors in world than is one of you, —   \nyon hero in harness! No henchman he\nworthied by weapons, if witness his features,\nhis peerless presence!

Now, dwellers afar,\nocean-travellers, take from me\nsimple advice: the sooner the better\nI hear of the country whence ye came.”\nTo him the stateliest spake in answer;\nthe warriors’ leader his word-hoard unlocked:—\n“We are by kin of the clan of Geats,\nand Hygelac’s own hearth-fellows we.\nTo folk afar was my father known,\nnoble atheling, Ecgtheow named.\nFull of winters, he fared away\naged from earth; he is honored still\nthrough width of the world by wise men all.\nTo thy lord and liege in loyal mood\nwe hasten hither, to Healfdene’s son,\npeople-protector: be pleased to advise us!\nTo that mighty-one come we on mickle errand,\nto the lord of the Danes; nor deem I right\nthat aught be hidden. We hear — thou knowest\nif sooth it is — the saying of men,\nthat amid the Scyldings a scathing monster,\ndark ill-doer, in dusky nights\nshows terrific his rage unmatched,\nhatred and murder. To Hrothgar I\nin greatness of soul would succor bring,\nso the Wise-and-Brave   may worst his foes, —\nif ever the end of ills is fated,\nof cruel contest, if cure shall follow,\nand the boiling care-waves cooler grow;\nelse ever afterward anguish-days\nhe shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place\nhigh on its hill that house unpeered!”\nAstride his steed, the strand-ward answered,\nclansman unquailing: “The keen-souled thane\nmust be skilled to sever and sunder duly\nwords and works, if he well intends.\nI gather, this band is graciously bent\nto the Scyldings’ master. March, then, bearing\nweapons and weeds the way I show you.\nI will bid my men your boat meanwhile\nto guard for fear lest foemen come, —\nyour new-tarred ship by shore of ocean\nfaithfully watching till once again\nit waft o’er the waters those well-loved thanes,\n— winding-neck’d wood, — to Weders’ bounds,\nheroes such as the hest of fate\nshall succor and save from the shock of war.”\nThey bent them to march, — the boat lay still,\nfettered by cable and fast at anchor,\nbroad-bosomed ship. — Then shone the boars   \nover the cheek-guard; chased with gold,\nkeen and gleaming, guard it kept\no’er the man of war, as marched along\nheroes in haste, till the hall they saw,\nbroad of gable and bright with gold:\nthat was the fairest, ‘mid folk of earth,\nof houses ‘neath heaven, where Hrothgar lived,\nand the gleam of it lightened o’er lands afar.\nThe sturdy shieldsman showed that bright\nburg-of-the-boldest; bade them go\nstraightway thither; his steed then turned,\nhardy hero, and hailed them thus:—\n“Tis time that I fare from you. Father Almighty\nin grace and mercy guard you well,\nsafe in your seekings. Seaward I go,\n‘gainst hostile warriors hold my watch.”\nSTONE-BRIGHT the street:   it showed the way\nto the crowd of clansmen. Corselets glistened\nhand-forged, hard; on their harness bright\nthe steel ring sang, as they strode along\nin mail of battle, and marched to the hall.\nThere, weary of ocean, the wall along\nthey set their bucklers, their broad shields, down,\nand bowed them to bench: the breastplates clanged,\nwar-gear of men; their weapons stacked,\nspears of the seafarers stood together,\ngray-tipped ash: that iron band\nwas worthily weaponed! — A warrior proud\nasked of the heroes their home and kin.\n“Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields,\nharness gray and helmets grim,\nspears in multitude? Messenger, I,\nHrothgar’s herald! Heroes so many\nne’er met I as strangers of mood so strong.\n‘Tis plain that for prowess, not plunged into exile,\nfor high-hearted valor, Hrothgar ye seek!”\nHim the sturdy-in-war bespake with words,\nproud earl of the Weders answer made,\nhardy ‘neath helmet:—”Hygelac’s, we,\nfellows at board; I am Beowulf named.\nI am seeking to say to the son of Healfdene\nthis mission of mine, to thy master-lord,\nthe doughty prince, if he deign at all\ngrace that we greet him, the good one, now.”\nWulfgar spake, the Wendles’ chieftain,\nwhose might of mind to many was known,\nhis courage and counsel: “The king of Danes,\nthe Scyldings’ friend, I fain will tell,\nthe Breaker-of-Rings, as the boon thou askest,\nthe famed prince, of thy faring hither,\nand, swiftly after, such answer bring\nas the doughty monarch may deign to give.”\nHied then in haste to where Hrothgar sat\nwhite-haired and old, his earls about him,\ntill the stout thane stood at the shoulder there\nof the Danish king: good courtier he!\nWulfgar spake to his winsome lord:—\n“Hither have fared to thee far-come men\no’er the paths of ocean, people of Geatland;\nand the stateliest there by his sturdy band\nis Beowulf named. This boon they seek,\nthat they, my master, may with thee\nhave speech at will: nor spurn their prayer\nto give them hearing, gracious Hrothgar!\nIn weeds of the warrior worthy they,\nmethinks, of our liking; their leader most surely,\na hero that hither his henchmen has led.”\nHROTHGAR answered, helmet of Scyldings:—\n“I knew him of yore in his youthful days;\nhis aged father was Ecgtheow named,\nto whom, at home, gave Hrethel the Geat\nhis only daughter. Their offspring bold\nfares hither to seek the steadfast friend.\nAnd seamen, too, have said me this, —\nwho carried my gifts to the Geatish court,\nthither for thanks, — he has thirty men’s\nheft of grasp in the gripe of his hand,\nthe bold-in-battle. Blessed God\nout of his mercy this man hath sent\nto Danes of the West, as I ween indeed,\nagainst horror of Grendel. I hope to give\nthe good youth gold for his gallant thought.\nBe thou in haste, and bid them hither,\nclan of kinsmen, to come before me;\nand add this word, — they are welcome guests\nto folk of the Danes.” [To the door of the hall\nWulfgar went] and the word declared:—\n“To you this message my master sends,\nEast-Danes’ king, that your kin he knows,\nhardy heroes, and hails you all\nwelcome hither o’er waves of the sea!\nYe may wend your way in war-attire,\nand under helmets Hrothgar greet;\nbut let here the battle-shields bide your parley,\nand wooden war-shafts wait its end.”\nUprose the mighty one, ringed with his men,\nbrave band of thanes: some bode without,\nbattle-gear guarding, as bade the chief.\nThen hied that troop where the herald led them,\nunder Heorot’s roof: [the hero strode,]\nhardy ‘neath helm, till the hearth he neared.\nBeowulf spake, — his breastplate gleamed,\nwar-net woven by wit of the smith:—\n“Thou Hrothgar, hail! Hygelac’s I,\nkinsman and follower. Fame a plenty\nhave I gained in youth! These Grendel-deeds\nI heard in my home-land heralded clear.\nSeafarers say how stands this hall,\nof buildings best, for your band of thanes\nempty and idle, when evening sun\nin the harbor of heaven is hidden away.\nSo my vassals advised me well, —\nbrave and wise, the best of men, —\nO sovran Hrothgar, to seek thee here,\nfor my nerve and my might they knew full well.\nThemselves had seen me from slaughter come\nblood-flecked from foes, where five I bound,\nand that wild brood worsted. I’ the waves I slew\nnicors   by night, in need and peril\navenging the Weders,   whose woe they sought, —\ncrushing the grim ones. Grendel now,\nmonster cruel, be mine to quell\nin single battle! So, from thee,\nthou sovran of the Shining-Danes,\nScyldings’-bulwark, a boon I seek, —\nand, Friend-of-the-folk, refuse it not,\nO Warriors’-shield, now I’ve wandered far, —\nthat I alone with my liegemen here,\nthis hardy band, may Heorot purge!\nMore I hear, that the monster dire,\nin his wanton mood, of weapons recks not;\nhence shall I scorn — so Hygelac stay,\nking of my kindred, kind to me! —\nbrand or buckler to bear in the fight,\ngold-colored targe: but with gripe alone\nmust I front the fiend and fight for life,\nfoe against foe. Then faith be his\nin the doom of the Lord whom death shall take.\nFain, I ween, if the fight he win,\nin this hall of gold my Geatish band\nwill he fearless eat, — as oft before, —\nmy noblest thanes. Nor need’st thou then\nto hide my head;   for his shall I be,\ndyed in gore, if death must take me;\nand my blood-covered body he’ll bear as prey,\nruthless devour it, the roamer-lonely,\nwith my life-blood redden his lair in the fen:\nno further for me need’st food prepare!\nTo Hygelac send, if Hild   should take me,\nbest of war-weeds, warding my breast,\narmor excellent, heirloom of Hrethel\nand work of Wayland.   Fares Wyrd   as she must.”\nHROTHGAR spake, the Scyldings’-helmet:—\n“For fight defensive, Friend my Beowulf,\nto succor and save, thou hast sought us here.\nThy father’s combat   a feud enkindled\nwhen Heatholaf with hand he slew\namong the Wylfings; his Weder kin\nfor horror of fighting feared to hold him.\nFleeing, he sought our South-Dane folk,\nover surge of ocean the Honor-Scyldings,\nwhen first I was ruling the folk of Danes,\nwielded, youthful, this widespread realm,\nthis hoard-hold of heroes. Heorogar was dead,\nmy elder brother, had breathed his last,\nHealfdene’s bairn: he was better than I!\nStraightway the feud with fee   I settled,\nto the Wylfings sent, o’er watery ridges,\ntreasures olden: oaths he   swore me.\nSore is my soul to say to any\nof the race of man what ruth for me\nin Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought,\nwhat sudden harryings. Hall-folk fail me,\nmy warriors wane; for Wyrd hath swept them\ninto Grendel’s grasp. But God is able\nthis deadly foe from his deeds to turn!\nBoasted full oft, as my beer they drank,\nearls o’er the ale-cup, armed men,\nthat they would bide in the beer-hall here,\nGrendel’s attack with terror of blades.\nThen was this mead-house at morning tide\ndyed with gore, when the daylight broke,\nall the boards of the benches blood-besprinkled,\ngory the hall: I had heroes the less,\ndoughty dear-ones that death had reft.\n— But sit to the banquet, unbind thy words,\nhardy hero, as heart shall prompt thee.”\nGathered together, the Geatish men\nin the banquet-hall on bench assigned,\nsturdy-spirited, sat them down,\nhardy-hearted. A henchman attended,\ncarried the carven cup in hand,\nserved the clear mead. Oft minstrels sang\nblithe in Heorot. Heroes revelled,\nno dearth of warriors, Weder and Dane.\nUNFERTH spake, the son of Ecglaf,\nwho sat at the feet of the Scyldings’ lord,\nunbound the battle-runes.   — Beowulf’s quest,\nsturdy seafarer’s, sorely galled him;\never he envied that other men\nshould more achieve in middle-earth\nof fame under heaven than he himself. —\n“Art thou that Beowulf, Breca’s rival,\nwho emulous swam on the open sea,\nwhen for pride the pair of you proved the floods,\nand wantonly dared in waters deep\nto risk your lives? No living man,\nor lief or loath, from your labor dire\ncould you dissuade, from swimming the main.\nOcean-tides with your arms ye covered,\nwith strenuous hands the sea-streets measured,\nswam o’er the waters. Winter’s storm\nrolled the rough waves. In realm of sea\na sennight strove ye. In swimming he topped thee,\nhad more of main! Him at morning-tide\nbillows bore to the Battling Reamas,\nwhence he hied to his home so dear\nbeloved of his liegemen, to land of Brondings,\nfastness fair, where his folk he ruled,\ntown and treasure. In triumph o’er thee\nBeanstan’s bairn   his boast achieved.\nSo ween I for thee a worse adventure\n— though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been,\nin struggle grim, — if Grendel’s approach\nthou darst await through the watch of night!”\nBeowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:—\n“What a deal hast uttered, dear my Unferth,\ndrunken with beer, of Breca now,\ntold of his triumph! Truth I claim it,\nthat I had more of might in the sea\nthan any man else, more ocean-endurance.\nWe twain had talked, in time of youth,\nand made our boast, — we were merely boys,\nstriplings still, — to stake our lives\nfar at sea: and so we performed it.\nNaked swords, as we swam along,\nwe held in hand, with hope to guard us\nagainst the whales. Not a whit from me\ncould he float afar o’er the flood of waves,\nhaste o’er the billows; nor him I abandoned.\nTogether we twain on the tides abode\nfive nights full till the flood divided us,\nchurning waves and chillest weather,\ndarkling night, and the northern wind\nruthless rushed on us: rough was the surge.\nNow the wrath of the sea-fish rose apace;\nyet me ‘gainst the monsters my mailed coat,\nhard and hand-linked, help afforded, —\nbattle-sark braided my breast to ward,\ngarnished with gold. There grasped me firm\nand haled me to bottom the hated foe,\nwith grimmest gripe. ‘Twas granted me, though,\nto pierce the monster with point of sword,\nwith blade of battle: huge beast of the sea\nwas whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine.\nME thus often the evil monsters\nthronging threatened. With thrust of my sword,\nthe darling, I dealt them due return!\nNowise had they bliss from their booty then\nto devour their victim, vengeful creatures,\nseated to banquet at bottom of sea;\nbut at break of day, by my brand sore hurt,\non the edge of ocean up they lay,\nput to sleep by the sword. And since, by them\non the fathomless sea-ways sailor-folk\nare never molested. — Light from east,\ncame bright God’s beacon; the billows sank,\nso that I saw the sea-cliffs high,\nwindy walls. For Wyrd oft saveth\nearl undoomed if he doughty be!\nAnd so it came that I killed with my sword\nnine of the nicors. Of night-fought battles\nne’er heard I a harder ‘neath heaven’s dome,\nnor adrift on the deep a more desolate man!\nYet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch,\nthough spent with swimming. The sea upbore me,\nflood of the tide, on Finnish land,\nthe welling waters. No wise of thee\nhave I heard men tell such terror of falchions,\nbitter battle. Breca ne’er yet,\nnot one of you pair, in the play of war\nsuch daring deed has done at all\nwith bloody brand, — I boast not of it! —\nthough thou wast the bane   of thy brethren dear,\nthy closest kin, whence curse of hell\nawaits thee, well as thy wit may serve!\nFor I say in sooth, thou son of Ecglaf,\nnever had Grendel these grim deeds wrought,\nmonster dire, on thy master dear,\nin Heorot such havoc, if heart of thine\nwere as battle-bold as thy boast is loud!\nBut he has found no feud will happen;\nfrom sword-clash dread of your Danish clan\nhe vaunts him safe, from the Victor-Scyldings.\nHe forces pledges, favors none\nof the land of Danes, but lustily murders,\nfights and feasts, nor feud he dreads\nfrom Spear-Dane men. But speedily now\nshall I prove him the prowess and pride of the Geats,\nshall bid him battle. Blithe to mead\ngo he that listeth, when light of dawn\nthis morrow morning o’er men of earth,\nether-robed sun from the south shall beam!”\nJoyous then was the Jewel-giver,\nhoar-haired, war-brave; help awaited\nthe Bright-Danes’ prince, from Beowulf hearing,\nfolk’s good shepherd, such firm resolve.\nThen was laughter of liegemen loud resounding\nwith winsome words. Came Wealhtheow forth,\nqueen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy,\ngold-decked, greeting the guests in hall;\nand the high-born lady handed the cup\nfirst to the East-Danes’ heir and warden,\nbade him be blithe at the beer-carouse,\nthe land’s beloved one. Lustily took he\nbanquet and beaker, battle-famed king.\nThrough the hall then went the Helmings’ Lady,\nto younger and older everywhere\ncarried the cup, till come the moment\nwhen the ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted,\nto Beowulf bore the beaker of mead.\nShe greeted the Geats’ lord, God she thanked,\nin wisdom’s words, that her will was granted,\nthat at last on a hero her hope could lean\nfor comfort in terrors. The cup he took,\nhardy-in-war, from Wealhtheow’s hand,\nand answer uttered the eager-for-combat.\nBeowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:—\n“This was my thought, when my thanes and I\nbent to the ocean and entered our boat,\nthat I would work the will of your people\nfully, or fighting fall in death,\nin fiend’s gripe fast. I am firm to do\nan earl’s brave deed, or end the days\nof this life of mine in the mead-hall here.”\nWell these words to the woman seemed,\nBeowulf’s battle-boast. — Bright with gold\nthe stately dame by her spouse sat down.\nAgain, as erst, began in hall\nwarriors’ wassail and words of power,\nthe proud-band’s revel, till presently\nthe son of Healfdene hastened to seek\nrest for the night; he knew there waited\nfight for the fiend in that festal hall,\nwhen the sheen of the sun they saw no more,\nand dusk of night sank darkling nigh,\nand shadowy shapes came striding on,\nwan under welkin. The warriors rose.\nMan to man, he made harangue,\nHrothgar to Beowulf, bade him hail,\nlet him wield the wine hall: a word he added:—\n“Never to any man erst I trusted,\nsince I could heave up hand and shield,\nthis noble Dane-Hall, till now to thee.\nHave now and hold this house unpeered;\nremember thy glory; thy might declare;\nwatch for the foe! No wish shall fail thee\nif thou bidest the battle with bold-won life.”\nTHEN Hrothgar went with his hero-train,\ndefence-of-Scyldings, forth from hall;\nfain would the war-lord Wealhtheow seek,\ncouch of his queen. The King-of-Glory\nagainst this Grendel a guard had set,\nso heroes heard, a hall-defender,\nwho warded the monarch and watched for the monster.\nIn truth, the Geats’ prince gladly trusted\nhis mettle, his might, the mercy of God!\nCast off then his corselet of iron,\nhelmet from head; to his henchman gave, —\nchoicest of weapons, — the well-chased sword,\nbidding him guard the gear of battle.\nSpake then his Vaunt the valiant man,\nBeowulf Geat, ere the bed be sought:—\n“Of force in fight no feebler I count me,\nin grim war-deeds, than Grendel deems him.\nNot with the sword, then, to sleep of death\nhis life will I give, though it lie in my power.\nNo skill is his to strike against me,\nmy shield to hew though he hardy be,\nbold in battle; we both, this night,\nshall spurn the sword, if he seek me here,\nunweaponed, for war. Let wisest God,\nsacred Lord, on which side soever\ndoom decree as he deemeth right.”\nReclined then the chieftain, and cheek-pillows held\nthe head of the earl, while all about him\nseamen hardy on hall-beds sank.\nNone of them thought that thence their steps\nto the folk and fastness that fostered them,\nto the land they loved, would lead them back!\nFull well they wist that on warriors many\nbattle-death seized, in the banquet-hall,\nof Danish clan. But comfort and help,\nwar-weal weaving, to Weder folk\nthe Master gave, that, by might of one,\nover their enemy all prevailed,\nby single strength. In sooth ‘tis told\nthat highest God o’er human kind\nhath wielded ever! — Thro’ wan night striding,\ncame the walker-in-shadow. Warriors slept\nwhose hest was to guard the gabled hall, —\nall save one. ‘Twas widely known\nthat against God’s will the ghostly ravager\nhim   could not hurl to haunts of darkness;\nwakeful, ready, with warrior’s wrath,\nbold he bided the battle’s issue.\nTHEN from the moorland, by misty crags,\nwith God’s wrath laden, Grendel came.\nThe monster was minded of mankind now\nsundry to seize in the stately house.\nUnder welkin he walked, till the wine-palace there,\ngold-hall of men, he gladly discerned,\nflashing with fretwork. Not first time, this,\nthat he the home of Hrothgar sought, —\nyet ne’er in his life-day, late or early,\nsuch hardy heroes, such hall-thanes, found!\nTo the house the warrior walked apace,\nparted from peace;   the portal opended,\nthough with forged bolts fast, when his fists had struck it,\nand baleful he burst in his blatant rage,\nthe house’s mouth. All hastily, then,\no’er fair-paved floor the fiend trod on,\nireful he strode; there streamed from his eyes\nfearful flashes, like flame to see.\nHe spied in hall the hero-band,\nkin and clansmen clustered asleep,\nhardy liegemen. Then laughed his heart;\nfor the monster was minded, ere morn should dawn,\nsavage, to sever the soul of each,\nlife from body, since lusty banquet\nwaited his will! But Wyrd forbade him\nto seize any more of men on earth\nafter that evening. Eagerly watched\nHygelac’s kinsman his cursed foe,\nhow he would fare in fell attack.\nNot that the monster was minded to pause!\nStraightway he seized a sleeping warrior\nfor the first, and tore him fiercely asunder,\nthe bone-frame bit, drank blood in streams,\nswallowed him piecemeal: swiftly thus\nthe lifeless corse was clear devoured,\ne’en feet and hands. Then farther he hied;\nfor the hardy hero with hand he grasped,\nfelt for the foe with fiendish claw,\nfor the hero reclining, — who clutched it boldly,\nprompt to answer, propped on his arm.\nSoon then saw that shepherd-of-evils\nthat never he met in this middle-world,\nin the ways of earth, another wight\nwith heavier hand-gripe; at heart he feared,\nsorrowed in soul, — none the sooner escaped!\nFain would he flee, his fastness seek,\nthe den of devils: no doings now\nsuch as oft he had done in days of old!\nThen bethought him the hardy Hygelac-thane\nof his boast at evening: up he bounded,\ngrasped firm his foe, whose fingers cracked.\nThe fiend made off, but the earl close followed.\nThe monster meant — if he might at all —\nto fling himself free, and far away\nfly to the fens, — knew his fingers’ power\nin the gripe of the grim one. Gruesome march\nto Heorot this monster of harm had made!\nDin filled the room; the Danes were bereft,\ncastle-dwellers and clansmen all,\nearls, of their ale. Angry were both\nthose savage hall-guards: the house resounded.\nWonder it was the wine-hall firm\nin the strain of their struggle stood, to earth\nthe fair house fell not; too fast it was\nwithin and without by its iron bands\ncraftily clamped; though there crashed from sill\nmany a mead-bench — men have told me —\ngay with gold, where the grim foes wrestled.\nSo well had weened the wisest Scyldings\nthat not ever at all might any man\nthat bone-decked, brave house break asunder,\ncrush by craft, — unless clasp of fire\nin smoke engulfed it. — Again uprose\ndin redoubled. Danes of the North\nwith fear and frenzy were filled, each one,\nwho from the wall that wailing heard,\nGod’s foe sounding his grisly song,\ncry of the conquered, clamorous pain\nfrom captive of hell. Too closely held him\nhe who of men in might was strongest\nin that same day of this our life.\nNOT in any wise would the earls’-defence   \nsuffer that slaughterous stranger to live,\nuseless deeming his days and years\nto men on earth. Now many an earl\nof Beowulf brandished blade ancestral,\nfain the life of their lord to shield,\ntheir praised prince, if power were theirs;\nnever they knew, — as they neared the foe,\nhardy-hearted heroes of war,\naiming their swords on every side\nthe accursed to kill, — no keenest blade,\nno farest of falchions fashioned on earth,\ncould harm or hurt that hideous fiend!\nHe was safe, by his spells, from sword of battle,\nfrom edge of iron. Yet his end and parting\non that same day of this our life\nwoful should be, and his wandering soul\nfar off flit to the fiends’ domain.\nSoon he found, who in former days,\nharmful in heart and hated of God,\non many a man such murder wrought,\nthat the frame of his body failed him now.\nFor him the keen-souled kinsman of Hygelac\nheld in hand; hateful alive\nwas each to other. The outlaw dire\ntook mortal hurt; a mighty wound\nshowed on his shoulder, and sinews cracked,\nand the bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now\nthe glory was given, and Grendel thence\ndeath-sick his den in the dark moor sought,\nnoisome abode: he knew too well\nthat here was the last of life, an end\nof his days on earth. — To all the Danes\nby that bloody battle the boon had come.\nFrom ravage had rescued the roving stranger\nHrothgar’s hall; the hardy and wise one\nhad purged it anew. His night-work pleased him,\nhis deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes\nhad the valiant Geat his vaunt made good,\nall their sorrow and ills assuaged,\ntheir bale of battle borne so long,\nand all the dole they erst endured\npain a-plenty. — ‘Twas proof of this,\nwhen the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down,\narm and shoulder, — all, indeed,\nof Grendel’s gripe, — ‘neath the gabled roof’\nMANY at morning, as men have told me,\nwarriors gathered the gift-hall round,\nfolk-leaders faring from far and near,\no’er wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view,\ntrace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed\nthe enemy’s end to any man\nwho saw by the gait of the graceless foe\nhow the weary-hearted, away from thence,\nbaffled in battle and banned, his steps\ndeath-marked dragged to the devils’ mere.\nBloody the billows were boiling there,\nturbid the tide of tumbling waves\nhorribly seething, with sword-blood hot,\nby that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor\nlaid forlorn his life adown,\nhis heathen soul,-and hell received it.\nHome then rode the hoary clansmen\nfrom that merry journey, and many a youth,\non horses white, the hardy warriors,\nback from the mere. Then Beowulf’s glory\neager they echoed, and all averred\nthat from sea to sea, or south or north,\nthere was no other in earth’s domain,\nunder vault of heaven, more valiant found,\nof warriors none more worthy to rule!\n(On their lord beloved they laid no slight,\ngracious Hrothgar: a good king he!)\nFrom time to time, the tried-in-battle\ntheir gray steeds set to gallop amain,\nand ran a race when the road seemed fair.\nFrom time to time, a thane of the king,\nwho had made many vaunts, and was mindful of verses,\nstored with sagas and songs of old,\nbound word to word in well-knit rime,\nwelded his lay; this warrior soon\nof Beowulf’s quest right cleverly sang,\nand artfully added an excellent tale,\nin well-ranged words, of the warlike deeds\nhe had heard in saga of Sigemund.\nStrange the story: he said it all, —\nthe Waelsing’s wanderings wide, his struggles,\nwhich never were told to tribes of men,\nthe feuds and the frauds, save to Fitela only,\nwhen of these doings he deigned to speak,\nuncle to nephew; as ever the twain\nstood side by side in stress of war,\nand multitude of the monster kind\nthey had felled with their swords. Of Sigemund grew,\nwhen he passed from life, no little praise;\nfor the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed\nthat herded the hoard:   under hoary rock\nthe atheling dared the deed alone\nfearful quest, nor was Fitela there.\nYet so it befell, his falchion pierced\nthat wondrous worm, — on the wall it struck,\nbest blade; the dragon died in its blood.\nThus had the dread-one by daring achieved\nover the ring-hoard to rule at will,\nhimself to pleasure; a sea-boat he loaded,\nand bore on its bosom the beaming gold,\nson of Waels; the worm was consumed.\nHe had of all heroes the highest renown\namong races of men, this refuge-of-warriors,\nfor deeds of daring that decked his name\nsince the hand and heart of Heremod\ngrew slack in battle. He, swiftly banished\nto mingle with monsters at mercy of foes,\nto death was betrayed; for torrents of sorrow\nhad lamed him too long; a load of care\nto earls and athelings all he proved.\nOft indeed, in earlier days,\nfor the warrior’s wayfaring wise men mourned,\nwho had hoped of him help from harm and bale,\nand had thought their sovran’s son would thrive,\nfollow his father, his folk protect,\nthe hoard and the stronghold, heroes’ land,\nhome of Scyldings. — But here, thanes said,\nthe kinsman of Hygelac kinder seemed\nto all: the other   was urged to crime!\nAnd afresh to the race,   the fallow roads\nby swift steeds measured! The morning sun\nwas climbing higher. Clansmen hastened\nto the high-built hall, those hardy-minded,\nthe wonder to witness. Warden of treasure,\ncrowned with glory, the king himself,\nwith stately band from the bride-bower strode;\nand with him the queen and her crowd of maidens\nmeasured the path to the mead-house fair.\nHROTHGAR spake, — to the hall he went,\nstood by the steps, the steep roof saw,\ngarnished with gold, and Grendel’s hand:—\n“For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler\nbe speedy thanks! A throng of sorrows\nI have borne from Grendel; but God still works\nwonder on wonder, the Warden-of-Glory.\nIt was but now that I never more\nfor woes that weighed on me waited help\nlong as I lived, when, laved in blood,\nstood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house, —\nwidespread woe for wise men all,\nwho had no hope to hinder ever\nfoes infernal and fiendish sprites\nfrom havoc in hall. This hero now,\nby the Wielder’s might, a work has done\nthat not all of us erst could ever do\nby wile and wisdom. Lo, well can she say\nwhoso of women this warrior bore\namong sons of men, if still she liveth,\nthat the God of the ages was good to her\nin the birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee,\nof heroes best, I shall heartily love\nas mine own, my son; preserve thou ever\nthis kinship new: thou shalt never lack\nwealth of the world that I wield as mine!\nFull oft for less have I largess showered,\nmy precious hoard, on a punier man,\nless stout in struggle. Thyself hast now\nfulfilled such deeds, that thy fame shall endure\nthrough all the ages. As ever he did,\nwell may the Wielder reward thee still!”\nBeowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:—\n“This work of war most willingly\nwe have fought, this fight, and fearlessly dared\nforce of the foe. Fain, too, were I\nhadst thou but seen himself, what time\nthe fiend in his trappings tottered to fall!\nSwiftly, I thought, in strongest gripe\non his bed of death to bind him down,\nthat he in the hent of this hand of mine\nshould breathe his last: but he broke away.\nHim I might not — the Maker willed not —\nhinder from flight, and firm enough hold\nthe life-destroyer: too sturdy was he,\nthe ruthless, in running! For rescue, however,\nhe left behind him his hand in pledge,\narm and shoulder; nor aught of help\ncould the cursed one thus procure at all.\nNone the longer liveth he, loathsome fiend,\nsunk in his sins, but sorrow holds him\ntightly grasped in gripe of anguish,\nin baleful bonds, where bide he must,\nevil outlaw, such awful doom\nas the Mighty Maker shall mete him out.”\nMore silent seemed the son of Ecglaf   \nin boastful speech of his battle-deeds,\nsince athelings all, through the earl’s great prowess,\nbeheld that hand, on the high roof gazing,\nfoeman’s fingers, — the forepart of each\nof the sturdy nails to steel was likest, —\nheathen’s “hand-spear,” hostile warrior’s\nclaw uncanny. ‘Twas clear, they said,\nthat him no blade of the brave could touch,\nhow keen soever, or cut away\nthat battle-hand bloody from baneful foe.\nTHERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now\nfor hands to bedeck it, and dense was the throng\nof men and women the wine-hall to cleanse,\nthe guest-room to garnish. Gold-gay shone the hangings\nthat were wove on the wall, and wonders many\nto delight each mortal that looks upon them.\nThough braced within by iron bands,\nthat building bright was broken sorely;   \nrent were its hinges; the roof alone\nheld safe and sound, when, seared with crime,\nthe fiendish foe his flight essayed,\nof life despairing. — No light thing that,\nthe flight for safety, — essay it who will!\nForced of fate, he shall find his way\nto the refuge ready for race of man,\nfor soul-possessors, and sons of earth;\nand there his body on bed of death\nshall rest after revel. Arrived was the hour\nwhen to hall proceeded Healfdene’s son:\nthe king himself would sit to banquet.\nNe’er heard I of host in haughtier throng\nmore graciously gathered round giver-of-rings!\nBowed then to bench those bearers-of-glory,\nfain of the feasting. Featly received\nmany a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit,\nkinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall,\nHrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot now\nwas filled with friends; the folk of Scyldings\nne’er yet had tried the traitor’s deed.\nTo Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene\na gold-wove banner, guerdon of triumph,\nbroidered battle-flag, breastplate and helmet;\nand a splendid sword was seen of many\nborne to the brave one. Beowulf took\ncup in hall:   for such costly gifts\nhe suffered no shame in that soldier throng.\nFor I heard of few heroes, in heartier mood,\nwith four such gifts, so fashioned with gold,\non the ale-bench honoring others thus!\nO’er the roof of the helmet high, a ridge,\nwound with wires, kept ward o’er the head,\nlest the relict-of-files   should fierce invade,\nsharp in the strife, when that shielded hero\nshould go to grapple against his foes.\nThen the earls’-defence   on the floor   bade lead\ncoursers eight, with carven head-gear,\nadown the hall: one horse was decked\nwith a saddle all shining and set in jewels;\n‘twas the battle-seat of the best of kings,\nwhen to play of swords the son of Healfdene\nwas fain to fare. Ne’er failed his valor\nin the crush of combat when corpses fell.\nTo Beowulf over them both then gave\nthe refuge-of-Ingwines right and power,\no’er war-steeds and weapons: wished him joy of them.\nManfully thus the mighty prince,\nhoard-guard for heroes, that hard fight repaid\nwith steeds and treasures contemned by none\nwho is willing to say the sooth aright.\nAND the lord of earls, to each that came\nwith Beowulf over the briny ways,\nan heirloom there at the ale-bench gave,\nprecious gift; and the price   bade pay\nin gold for him whom Grendel erst\nmurdered, — and fain of them more had killed,\nhad not wisest God their Wyrd averted,\nand the man’s   brave mood. The Maker then\nruled human kind, as here and now.\nTherefore is insight always best,\nand forethought of mind. How much awaits him\nof lief and of loath, who long time here,\nthrough days of warfare this world endures!\nThen song and music mingled sounds\nin the presence of Healfdene’s head-of-armies   \nand harping was heard with the hero-lay\nas Hrothgar’s singer the hall-joy woke\nalong the mead-seats, making his song\nof that sudden raid on the sons of Finn.   \nHealfdene’s hero, Hnaef the Scylding,\nwas fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter.   \nHildeburh needed not hold in value\nher enemies’ honor!   Innocent both\nwere the loved ones she lost at the linden-play,\nbairn and brother, they bowed to fate,\nstricken by spears; ‘twas a sorrowful woman!\nNone doubted why the daughter of Hoc\nbewailed her doom when dawning came,\nand under the sky she saw them lying,\nkinsmen murdered, where most she had kenned\nof the sweets of the world! By war were swept, too,\nFinn’s own liegemen, and few were left;\nin the parleying-place   he could ply no longer\nweapon, nor war could he wage on Hengest,\nand rescue his remnant by right of arms\nfrom the prince’s thane. A pact he offered:\nanother dwelling the Danes should have,\nhall and high-seat, and half the power\nshould fall to them in Frisian land;\nand at the fee-gifts, Folcwald’s son\nday by day the Danes should honor,\nthe folk of Hengest favor with rings,\neven as truly, with treasure and jewels,\nwith fretted gold, as his Frisian kin\nhe meant to honor in ale-hall there.\nPact of peace they plighted further\non both sides firmly. Finn to Hengest\nwith oath, upon honor, openly promised\nthat woful remnant, with wise-men’s aid,\nnobly to govern, so none of the guests\nby word or work should warp the treaty,   \nor with malice of mind bemoan themselves\nas forced to follow their fee-giver’s slayer,\nlordless men, as their lot ordained.\nShould Frisian, moreover, with foeman’s taunt,\nthat murderous hatred to mind recall,\nthen edge of the sword must seal his doom.\nOaths were given, and ancient gold\nheaped from hoard. — The hardy Scylding,\nbattle-thane best,   on his balefire lay.\nAll on the pyre were plain to see\nthe gory sark, the gilded swine-crest,\nboar of hard iron, and athelings many\nslain by the sword: at the slaughter they fell.\nIt was Hildeburh’s hest, at Hnaef’s own pyre\nthe bairn of her body on brands to lay,\nhis bones to burn, on the balefire placed,\nat his uncle’s side. In sorrowful dirges\nbewept them the woman: great wailing ascended.\nThen wound up to welkin the wildest of death-fires,\nroared o’er the hillock:   heads all were melted,\ngashes burst, and blood gushed out\nfrom bites   of the body. Balefire devoured,\ngreediest spirit, those spared not by war\nout of either folk: their flower was gone.\nTHEN hastened those heroes their home to see,\nfriendless, to find the Frisian land,\nhouses and high burg. Hengest still\nthrough the death-dyed winter dwelt with Finn,\nholding pact, yet of home he minded,\nthough powerless his ring-decked prow to drive\nover the waters, now waves rolled fierce\nlashed by the winds, or winter locked them\nin icy fetters. Then fared another\nyear to men’s dwellings, as yet they do,\nthe sunbright skies, that their season ever\nduly await. Far off winter was driven;\nfair lay earth’s breast; and fain was the rover,\nthe guest, to depart, though more gladly he pondered\non wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep,\nand how to hasten the hot encounter\nwhere sons of the Frisians were sure to be.\nSo he escaped not the common doom,\nwhen Hun with “Lafing,” the light-of-battle,\nbest of blades, his bosom pierced:\nits edge was famed with the Frisian earls.\nOn fierce-heart Finn there fell likewise,\non himself at home, the horrid sword-death;\nfor Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack\nhad sorrowing told, from sea-ways landed,\nmourning their woes.   Finn’s wavering spirit\nbode not in breast. The burg was reddened\nwith blood of foemen, and Finn was slain,\nking amid clansmen; the queen was taken.\nTo their ship the Scylding warriors bore\nall the chattels the chieftain owned,\nwhatever they found in Finn’s domain\nof gems and jewels. The gentle wife\no’er paths of the deep to the Danes they bore,\nled to her land. The lay was finished,\nthe gleeman’s song. Then glad rose the revel;\nbench-joy brightened. Bearers draw\nfrom their “wonder-vats” wine. Comes Wealhtheow forth,\nunder gold-crown goes where the good pair sit,\nuncle and nephew, true each to the other one,\nkindred in amity. Unferth the spokesman\nat the Scylding lord’s feet sat: men had faith in his spirit,\nhis keenness of courage, though kinsmen had found him\nunsure at the sword-play. The Scylding queen spoke:\n“Quaff of this cup, my king and lord,\nbreaker of rings, and blithe be thou,\ngold-friend of men; to the Geats here speak\nsuch words of mildness as man should use.\nBe glad with thy Geats; of those gifts be mindful,\nor near or far, which now thou hast.\nMen say to me, as son thou wishest\nyon hero to hold. Thy Heorot purged,\njewel-hall brightest, enjoy while thou canst,\nwith many a largess; and leave to thy kin\nfolk and realm when forth thou goest\nto greet thy doom. For gracious I deem\nmy Hrothulf,   willing to hold and rule\nnobly our youths, if thou yield up first,\nprince of Scyldings, thy part in the world.\nI ween with good he will well requite\noffspring of ours, when all he minds\nthat for him we did in his helpless days\nof gift and grace to gain him honor!”\nThen she turned to the seat where her sons were placed,\nHrethric and Hrothmund, with heroes’ bairns,\nyoung men together: the Geat, too, sat there,\nBeowulf brave, the brothers between.\nA CUP she gave him, with kindly greeting\nand winsome words. Of wounden gold,\nshe offered, to honor him, arm-jewels twain,\ncorselet and rings, and of collars the noblest\nthat ever I knew the earth around.\nNe’er heard I so mighty, ‘neath heaven’s dome,\na hoard-gem of heroes, since Hama bore\nto his bright-built burg the Brisings’ necklace,\njewel and gem casket. — Jealousy fled he,\nEormenric’s hate: chose help eternal.\nHygelac Geat, grandson of Swerting,\non the last of his raids this ring bore with him,\nunder his banner the booty defending,\nthe war-spoil warding; but Wyrd o’erwhelmed him\nwhat time, in his daring, dangers he sought,\nfeud with Frisians. Fairest of gems\nhe bore with him over the beaker-of-waves,\nsovran strong: under shield he died.\nFell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks,\ngear of the breast, and that gorgeous ring;\nweaker warriors won the spoil,\nafter gripe of battle, from Geatland’s lord,\nand held the death-field. Din rose in hall.\nWealhtheow spake amid warriors, and said:—\n“This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth,\nBeowulf lov’d, these battle-weeds wear,\na royal treasure, and richly thrive!\nPreserve thy strength, and these striplings here\ncounsel in kindness: requital be mine.\nHast done such deeds, that for days to come\nthou art famed among folk both far and near,\nso wide as washeth the wave of Ocean\nhis windy walls. Through the ways of life\nprosper, O prince! I pray for thee\nrich possessions. To son of mine\nbe helpful in deed and uphold his joys!\nHere every earl to the other is true,\nmild of mood, to the master loyal!\nThanes are friendly, the throng obedient,\nliegemen are revelling: list and obey!”\nWent then to her place. — That was proudest of feasts;\nflowed wine for the warriors. Wyrd they knew not,\ndestiny dire, and the doom to be seen\nby many an earl when eve should come,\nand Hrothgar homeward hasten away,\nroyal, to rest. The room was guarded\nby an army of earls, as erst was done.\nThey bared the bench-boards; abroad they spread\nbeds and bolsters. — One beer-carouser\nin danger of doom lay down in the hall. —\nAt their heads they set their shields of war,\nbucklers bright; on the bench were there\nover each atheling, easy to see,\nthe high battle-helmet, the haughty spear,\nthe corselet of rings. ‘Twas their custom so\never to be for battle prepared,\nat home, or harrying, which it were,\neven as oft as evil threatened\ntheir sovran king. — They were clansmen good.\nTHEN sank they to sleep. With sorrow one bought\nhis rest of the evening, — as ofttime had happened\nwhen Grendel guarded that golden hall,\nevil wrought, till his end drew nigh,\nslaughter for sins. ‘Twas seen and told\nhow an avenger survived the fiend,\nas was learned afar. The livelong time\nafter that grim fight, Grendel’s mother,\nmonster of women, mourned her woe.\nShe was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters,\ncold sea-courses, since Cain cut down\nwith edge of the sword his only brother,\nhis father’s offspring: outlawed he fled,\nmarked with murder, from men’s delights\nwarded the wilds. — There woke from him\nsuch fate-sent ghosts as Grendel, who,\nwar-wolf horrid, at Heorot found\na warrior watching and waiting the fray,\nwith whom the grisly one grappled amain.\nBut the man remembered his mighty power,\nthe glorious gift that God had sent him,\nin his Maker’s mercy put his trust\nfor comfort and help: so he conquered the foe,\nfelled the fiend, who fled abject,\nreft of joy, to the realms of death,\nmankind’s foe. And his mother now,\ngloomy and grim, would go that quest\nof sorrow, the death of her son to avenge.\nTo Heorot came she, where helmeted Danes\nslept in the hall. Too soon came back\nold ills of the earls, when in she burst,\nthe mother of Grendel. Less grim, though, that terror,\ne’en as terror of woman in war is less,\nmight of maid, than of men in arms\nwhen, hammer-forged, the falchion hard,\nsword gore-stained, through swine of the helm,\ncrested, with keen blade carves amain.\nThen was in hall the hard-edge drawn,\nthe swords on the settles,   and shields a-many\nfirm held in hand: nor helmet minded\nnor harness of mail, whom that horror seized.\nHaste was hers; she would hie afar\nand save her life when the liegemen saw her.\nYet a single atheling up she seized\nfast and firm, as she fled to the moor.\nHe was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest,\nof trusty vassals betwixt the seas,\nwhom she killed on his couch, a clansman famous,\nin battle brave. — Nor was Beowulf there;\nanother house had been held apart,\nafter giving of gold, for the Geat renowned. —\nUproar filled Heorot; the hand all had viewed,\nblood-flecked, she bore with her; bale was returned,\ndole in the dwellings: ‘twas dire exchange\nwhere Dane and Geat were doomed to give\nthe lives of loved ones. Long-tried king,\nthe hoary hero, at heart was sad\nwhen he knew his noble no more lived,\nand dead indeed was his dearest thane.\nTo his bower was Beowulf brought in haste,\ndauntless victor. As daylight broke,\nalong with his earls the atheling lord,\nwith his clansmen, came where the king abode\nwaiting to see if the Wielder-of-All\nwould turn this tale of trouble and woe.\nStrode o’er floor the famed-in-strife,\nwith his hand-companions, — the hall resounded, —\nwishing to greet the wise old king,\nIngwines’ lord; he asked if the night\nhad passed in peace to the prince’s mind.\nHROTHGAR spake, helmet-of-Scyldings:—\n“Ask not of pleasure! Pain is renewed\nto Danish folk. Dead is Aeschere,\nof Yrmenlaf the elder brother,\nmy sage adviser and stay in council,\nshoulder-comrade in stress of fight\nwhen warriors clashed and we warded our heads,\nhewed the helm-boars; hero famed\nshould be every earl as Aeschere was!\nBut here in Heorot a hand hath slain him\nof wandering death-sprite. I wot not whither,   \nproud of the prey, her path she took,\nfain of her fill. The feud she avenged\nthat yesternight, unyieldingly,\nGrendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst, —\nseeing how long these liegemen mine\nhe ruined and ravaged. Reft of life,\nin arms he fell. Now another comes,\nkeen and cruel, her kin to avenge,\nfaring far in feud of blood\nso that many a thane shall think, who e’er\nsorrows in soul for that sharer of rings,\nthis is hardest of heart-bales. The hand lies low\nthat once was willing each wish to please.\nLand-dwellers here   and liegemen mine,\nwho house by those parts, I have heard relate\nthat such a pair they have sometimes seen,\nmarch-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting,\nwandering spirits: one of them seemed,\nso far as my folk could fairly judge,\nof womankind; and one, accursed,\nin man’s guise trod the misery-track\nof exile, though huger than human bulk.\nGrendel in days long gone they named him,\nfolk of the land; his father they knew not,\nnor any brood that was born to him\nof treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home;\nby wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands,\nfenways fearful, where flows the stream\nfrom mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks,\nunderground flood. Not far is it hence\nin measure of miles that the mere expands,\nand o’er it the frost-bound forest hanging,\nsturdily rooted, shadows the wave.\nBy night is a wonder weird to see,\nfire on the waters. So wise lived none\nof the sons of men, to search those depths!\nNay, though the heath-rover, harried by dogs,\nthe horn-proud hart, this holt should seek,\nlong distance driven, his dear life first\non the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge\nto hide his head: ‘tis no happy place!\nThence the welter of waters washes up\nwan to welkin when winds bestir\nevil storms, and air grows dusk,\nand the heavens weep. Now is help once more\nwith thee alone! The land thou knowst not,\nplace of fear, where thou findest out\nthat sin-flecked being. Seek if thou dare!\nI will reward thee, for waging this fight,\nwith ancient treasure, as erst I did,\nwith winding gold, if thou winnest back.”\nBEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:\n“Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us better\nfriends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them.\nEach of us all must his end abide\nin the ways of the world; so win who may\nglory ere death! When his days are told,\nthat is the warrior’s worthiest doom.\nRise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon,\nand mark the trail of the mother of Grendel.\nNo harbor shall hide her — heed my promise! —\nenfolding of field or forested mountain\nor floor of the flood, let her flee where she will!\nBut thou this day endure in patience,\nas I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one.”\nLeaped up the graybeard: God he thanked,\nmighty Lord, for the man’s brave words.\nFor Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled\nwave-maned steed. The sovran wise\nstately rode on; his shield-armed men\nfollowed in force. The footprints led\nalong the woodland, widely seen,\na path o’er the plain, where she passed, and trod\nthe murky moor; of men-at-arms\nshe bore the bravest and best one, dead,\nhim who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled.\nOn then went the atheling-born\no’er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles,\nnarrow passes and unknown ways,\nheadlands sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors.\nForemost he   fared, a few at his side\nof the wiser men, the ways to scan,\ntill he found in a flash the forested hill\nhanging over the hoary rock,\na woful wood: the waves below\nwere dyed in blood. The Danish men\nhad sorrow of soul, and for Scyldings all,\nfor many a hero, ‘twas hard to bear,\nill for earls, when Aeschere’s head\nthey found by the flood on the foreland there.\nWaves were welling, the warriors saw,\nhot with blood; but the horn sang oft\nbattle-song bold. The band sat down,\nand watched on the water worm-like things,\nsea-dragons strange that sounded the deep,\nand nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness —\nsuch as oft essay at hour of morn\non the road-of-sails their ruthless quest, —\nand sea-snakes and monsters. These started away,\nswollen and savage that song to hear,\nthat war-horn’s blast. The warden of Geats,\nwith bolt from bow, then balked of life,\nof wave-work, one monster, amid its heart\nwent the keen war-shaft; in water it seemed\nless doughty in swimming whom death had seized.\nSwift on the billows, with boar-spears well\nhooked and barbed, it was hard beset,\ndone to death and dragged on the headland,\nwave-roamer wondrous. Warriors viewed\nthe grisly guest. Then girt him Beowulf\nin martial mail, nor mourned for his life.\nHis breastplate broad and bright of hues,\nwoven by hand, should the waters try;\nwell could it ward the warrior’s body\nthat battle should break on his breast in vain\nnor harm his heart by the hand of a foe.\nAnd the helmet white that his head protected\nwas destined to dare the deeps of the flood,\nthrough wave-whirl win: ‘twas wound with chains,\ndecked with gold, as in days of yore\nthe weapon-smith worked it wondrously,\nwith swine-forms set it, that swords nowise,\nbrandished in battle, could bite that helm.\nNor was that the meanest of mighty helps\nwhich Hrothgar’s orator offered at need:\n“Hrunting” they named the hilted sword,\nof old-time heirlooms easily first;\niron was its edge, all etched with poison,\nwith battle-blood hardened, nor blenched it at fight\nin hero’s hand who held it ever,\non paths of peril prepared to go\nto folkstead   of foes. Not first time this\nit was destined to do a daring task.\nFor he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf\nsturdy and strong, that speech he had made,\ndrunk with wine, now this weapon he lent\nto a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not\nunder welter of waters wager his life\nas loyal liegeman. So lost he his glory,\nhonor of earls. With the other not so,\nwho girded him now for the grim encounter.\nBEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:—\n“Have mind, thou honored offspring of Healfdene\ngold-friend of men, now I go on this quest,\nsovran wise, what once was said:\nif in thy cause it came that I\nshould lose my life, thou wouldst loyal bide\nto me, though fallen, in father’s place!\nBe guardian, thou, to this group of my thanes,\nmy warrior-friends, if War should seize me;\nand the goodly gifts thou gavest me,\nHrothgar beloved, to Hygelac send!\nGeatland’s king may ken by the gold,\nHrethel’s son see, when he stares at the treasure,\nthat I got me a friend for goodness famed,\nand joyed while I could in my jewel-bestower.\nAnd let Unferth wield this wondrous sword,\nearl far-honored, this heirloom precious,\nhard of edge: with Hrunting I\nseek doom of glory, or Death shall take me.”\nAfter these words the Weder-Geat lord\nboldly hastened, biding never\nanswer at all: the ocean floods\nclosed o’er the hero. Long while of the day\nfled ere he felt the floor of the sea.\nSoon found the fiend who the flood-domain\nsword-hungry held these hundred winters,\ngreedy and grim, that some guest from above,\nsome man, was raiding her monster-realm.\nShe grasped out for him with grisly claws,\nand the warrior seized; yet scathed she not\nhis body hale; the breastplate hindered,\nas she strove to shatter the sark of war,\nthe linked harness, with loathsome hand.\nThen bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched,\nthe lord of rings to the lair she haunted\nwhiles vainly he strove, though his valor held,\nweapon to wield against wondrous monsters\nthat sore beset him; sea-beasts many\ntried with fierce tusks to tear his mail,\nand swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked\nhe was now in some hall, he knew not which,\nwhere water never could work him harm,\nnor through the roof could reach him ever\nfangs of the flood. Firelight he saw,\nbeams of a blaze that brightly shone.\nThen the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep,\nmere-wife monstrous. For mighty stroke\nhe swung his blade, and the blow withheld not.\nThen sang on her head that seemly blade\nits war-song wild. But the warrior found\nthe light-of-battle   was loath to bite,\nto harm the heart: its hard edge failed\nthe noble at need, yet had known of old\nstrife hand to hand, and had helmets cloven,\ndoomed men’s fighting-gear. First time, this,\nfor the gleaming blade that its glory fell.\nFirm still stood, nor failed in valor,\nheedful of high deeds, Hygelac’s kinsman;\nflung away fretted sword, featly jewelled,\nthe angry earl; on earth it lay\nsteel-edged and stiff. His strength he trusted,\nhand-gripe of might. So man shall do\nwhenever in war he weens to earn him\nlasting fame, nor fears for his life!\nSeized then by shoulder, shrank not from combat,\nthe Geatish war-prince Grendel’s mother.\nFlung then the fierce one, filled with wrath,\nhis deadly foe, that she fell to ground.\nSwift on her part she paid him back\nwith grisly grasp, and grappled with him.\nSpent with struggle, stumbled the warrior,\nfiercest of fighting-men, fell adown.\nOn the hall-guest she hurled herself, hent her short sword,\nbroad and brown-edged,   the bairn to avenge,\nthe sole-born son. — On his shoulder lay\nbraided breast-mail, barring death,\nwithstanding entrance of edge or blade.\nLife would have ended for Ecgtheow’s son,\nunder wide earth for that earl of Geats,\nhad his armor of war not aided him,\nbattle-net hard, and holy God\nwielded the victory, wisest Maker.\nThe Lord of Heaven allowed his cause;\nand easily rose the earl erect.\n‘MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant,\nold-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof,\nwarriors’ heirloom, weapon unmatched,\n— save only ‘twas more than other men\nto bandy-of-battle could bear at all —\nas the giants had wrought it, ready and keen.\nSeized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings’ chieftain,\nbold and battle-grim, brandished the sword,\nreckless of life, and so wrathfully smote\nthat it gripped her neck and grasped her hard,\nher bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced through\nthat fated-one’s flesh: to floor she sank.\nBloody the blade: he was blithe of his deed.\nThen blazed forth light. ‘Twas bright within\nas when from the sky there shines unclouded\nheaven’s candle. The hall he scanned.\nBy the wall then went he; his weapon raised\nhigh by its hilts the Hygelac-thane,\nangry and eager. That edge was not useless\nto the warrior now. He wished with speed\nGrendel to guerdon for grim raids many,\nfor the war he waged on Western-Danes\noftener far than an only time,\nwhen of Hrothgar’s hearth-companions\nhe slew in slumber, in sleep devoured,\nfifteen men of the folk of Danes,\nand as many others outward bore,\nhis horrible prey. Well paid for that\nthe wrathful prince! For now prone he saw\nGrendel stretched there, spent with war,\nspoiled of life, so scathed had left him\nHeorot’s battle. The body sprang far\nwhen after death it endured the blow,\nsword-stroke savage, that severed its head.\nSoon,   then, saw the sage companions\nwho waited with Hrothgar, watching the flood,\nthat the tossing waters turbid grew,\nblood-stained the mere. Old men together,\nhoary-haired, of the hero spake;\nthe warrior would not, they weened, again,\nproud of conquest, come to seek\ntheir mighty master. To many it seemed\nthe wolf-of-the-waves had won his life.\nThe ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings\nleft the headland; homeward went\nthe gold-friend of men.   But the guests sat on,\nstared at the surges, sick in heart,\nand wished, yet weened not, their winsome lord\nagain to see. Now that sword began,\nfrom blood of the fight, in battle-droppings,   \nwar-blade, to wane: ‘twas a wondrous thing\nthat all of it melted as ice is wont\nwhen frosty fetters the Father loosens,\nunwinds the wave-bonds, wielding all\nseasons and times: the true God he!\nNor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats\nprecious things, though a plenty he saw,\nsave only the head and that hilt withal\nblazoned with jewels: the blade had melted,\nburned was the bright sword, her blood was so hot,\nso poisoned the hell-sprite who perished within there.\nSoon he was swimming who safe saw in combat\ndownfall of demons; up-dove through the flood.\nThe clashing waters were cleansed now,\nwaste of waves, where the wandering fiend\nher life-days left and this lapsing world.\nSwam then to strand the sailors’-refuge,\nsturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty glad,\nof burden brave he bore with him.\nWent then to greet him, and God they thanked,\nthe thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe,\nthat safe and sound they could see him again.\nSoon from the hardy one helmet and armor\ndeftly they doffed: now drowsed the mere,\nwater ‘neath welkin, with war-blood stained.\nForth they fared by the footpaths thence,\nmerry at heart the highways measured,\nwell-known roads. Courageous men\ncarried the head from the cliff by the sea,\nan arduous task for all the band,\nthe firm in fight, since four were needed\non the shaft-of-slaughter   strenuously\nto bear to the gold-hall Grendel’s head.\nSo presently to the palace there\nfoemen fearless, fourteen Geats,\nmarching came. Their master-of-clan\nmighty amid them the meadow-ways trod.\nStrode then within the sovran thane\nfearless in fight, of fame renowned,\nhardy hero, Hrothgar to greet.\nAnd next by the hair into hall was borne\nGrendel’s head, where the henchmen were drinking,\nan awe to clan and queen alike,\na monster of marvel: the men looked on.\nBEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:—\n“Lo, now, this sea-booty, son of Healfdene,\nLord of Scyldings, we’ve lustily brought thee,\nsign of glory; thou seest it here.\nNot lightly did I with my life escape!\nIn war under water this work I essayed\nwith endless effort; and even so\nmy strength had been lost had the Lord not shielded me.\nNot a whit could I with Hrunting do\nin work of war, though the weapon is good;\nyet a sword the Sovran of Men vouchsafed me\nto spy on the wall there, in splendor hanging,\nold, gigantic, — how oft He guides\nthe friendless wight! — and I fought with that brand,\nfelling in fight, since fate was with me,\nthe house’s wardens. That war-sword then\nall burned, bright blade, when the blood gushed o’er it,\nbattle-sweat hot; but the hilt I brought back\nfrom my foes. So avenged I their fiendish deeds\ndeath-fall of Danes, as was due and right.\nAnd this is my hest, that in Heorot now\nsafe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band,\nand every thane of all thy folk\nboth old and young; no evil fear,\nScyldings’ lord, from that side again,\naught ill for thy earls, as erst thou must!”\nThen the golden hilt, for that gray-haired leader,\nhoary hero, in hand was laid,\ngiant-wrought, old. So owned and enjoyed it\nafter downfall of devils, the Danish lord,\nwonder-smiths’ work, since the world was rid\nof that grim-souled fiend, the foe of God,\nmurder-marked, and his mother as well.\nNow it passed into power of the people’s king,\nbest of all that the oceans bound\nwho have scattered their gold o’er Scandia’s isle.\nHrothgar spake — the hilt he viewed,\nheirloom old, where was etched the rise\nof that far-off fight when the floods o’erwhelmed,\nraging waves, the race of giants\n(fearful their fate!), a folk estranged\nfrom God Eternal: whence guerdon due\nin that waste of waters the Wielder paid them.\nSo on the guard of shining gold\nin runic staves it was rightly said\nfor whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought,\nbest of blades, in bygone days,\nand the hilt well wound. — The wise-one spake,\nson of Healfdene; silent were all:—\n“Lo, so may he say who sooth and right\nfollows ‘mid folk, of far times mindful,\na land-warden old,   that this earl belongs\nto the better breed! So, borne aloft,\nthy fame must fly, O friend my Beowulf,\nfar and wide o’er folksteads many. Firmly thou shalt all maintain,\nmighty strength with mood of wisdom. Love of mine will I assure thee,\nas, awhile ago, I promised; thou shalt prove a stay in future,\nin far-off years, to folk of thine,\nto the heroes a help. Was not Heremod thus\nto offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings,\nnor grew for their grace, but for grisly slaughter,\nfor doom of death to the Danishmen.\nHe slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades,\ncompanions at board! So he passed alone,\nchieftain haughty, from human cheer.\nThough him the Maker with might endowed,\ndelights of power, and uplifted high\nabove all men, yet blood-fierce his mind,\nhis breast-hoard, grew, no bracelets gave he\nto Danes as was due; he endured all joyless\nstrain of struggle and stress of woe,\nlong feud with his folk. Here find thy lesson!\nOf virtue advise thee! This verse I have said for thee,\nwise from lapsed winters. Wondrous seems\nhow to sons of men Almighty God\nin the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom,\nestate, high station: He swayeth all things.\nWhiles He letteth right lustily fare\nthe heart of the hero of high-born race, —\nin seat ancestral assigns him bliss,\nhis folk’s sure fortress in fee to hold,\nputs in his power great parts of the earth,\nempire so ample, that end of it\nthis wanter-of-wisdom weeneth none.\nSo he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm him\nillness or age; no evil cares\nshadow his spirit; no sword-hate threatens\nfrom ever an enemy: all the world\nwends at his will, no worse he knoweth,\ntill all within him obstinate pride\nwaxes and wakes while the warden slumbers,\nthe spirit’s sentry; sleep is too fast\nwhich masters his might, and the murderer nears,\nstealthily shooting the shafts from his bow!\n“UNDER harness his heart then is hit indeed\nby sharpest shafts; and no shelter avails\nfrom foul behest of the hellish fiend.   \nHim seems too little what long he possessed.\nGreedy and grim, no golden rings\nhe gives for his pride; the promised future\nforgets he and spurns, with all God has sent him,\nWonder-Wielder, of wealth and fame.\nYet in the end it ever comes\nthat the frame of the body fragile yields,\nfated falls; and there follows another\nwho joyously the jewels divides,\nthe royal riches, nor recks of his forebear.\nBan, then, such baleful thoughts, Beowulf dearest,\nbest of men, and the better part choose,\nprofit eternal; and temper thy pride,\nwarrior famous! The flower of thy might\nlasts now a while: but erelong it shall be\nthat sickness or sword thy strength shall minish,\nor fang of fire, or flooding billow,\nor bite of blade, or brandished spear,\nor odious age; or the eyes’ clear beam\nwax dull and darken: Death even thee\nin haste shall o’erwhelm, thou hero of war!\nSo the Ring-Danes these half-years a hundred I ruled,\nwielded ‘neath welkin, and warded them bravely\nfrom mighty-ones many o’er middle-earth,\nfrom spear and sword, till it seemed for me\nno foe could be found under fold of the sky.\nLo, sudden the shift! To me seated secure\ncame grief for joy when Grendel began\nto harry my home, the hellish foe;\nfor those ruthless raids, unresting I suffered\nheart-sorrow heavy. Heaven be thanked,\nLord Eternal, for life extended\nthat I on this head all hewn and bloody,\nafter long evil, with eyes may gaze!\n— Go to the bench now! Be glad at banquet,\nwarrior worthy! A wealth of treasure\nat dawn of day, be dealt between us!”\nGlad was the Geats’ lord, going betimes\nto seek his seat, as the Sage commanded.\nAfresh, as before, for the famed-in-battle,\nfor the band of the hall, was a banquet dight\nnobly anew. The Night-Helm darkened\ndusk o’er the drinkers. The doughty ones rose:\nfor the hoary-headed would hasten to rest,\naged Scylding; and eager the Geat,\nshield-fighter sturdy, for sleeping yearned.\nHim wander-weary, warrior-guest\nfrom far, a hall-thane heralded forth,\nwho by custom courtly cared for all\nneeds of a thane as in those old days\nwarrior-wanderers wont to have.\nSo slumbered the stout-heart. Stately the hall\nrose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on\ntill a raven black the rapture-of-heaven   \nblithe-heart boded. Bright came flying\nshine after shadow. The swordsmen hastened,\nathelings all were eager homeward\nforth to fare; and far from thence\nthe great-hearted guest would guide his keel.\nBade then the hardy-one Hrunting be brought\nto the son of Ecglaf, the sword bade him take,\nexcellent iron, and uttered his thanks for it,\nquoth that he counted it keen in battle,\n“war-friend” winsome: with words he slandered not\nedge of the blade: ‘twas a big-hearted man!\nNow eager for parting and armed at point\nwarriors waited, while went to his host\nthat Darling of Danes. The doughty atheling\nto high-seat hastened and Hrothgar greeted.\nBEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:—\n“Lo, we seafarers say our will,\nfar-come men, that we fain would seek\nHygelac now. We here have found\nhosts to our heart: thou hast harbored us well.\nIf ever on earth I am able to win me\nmore of thy love, O lord of men,\naught anew, than I now have done,\nfor work of war I am willing still!\nIf it come to me ever across the seas\nthat neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee, —\nas they that hate thee erewhile have used, —\nthousands then of thanes I shall bring,\nheroes to help thee. Of Hygelac I know,\nward of his folk, that, though few his years,\nthe lord of the Geats will give me aid\nby word and by work, that well I may serve thee,\nwielding the war-wood to win thy triumph\nand lending thee might when thou lackest men.\nIf thy Hrethric should come to court of Geats,\na sovran’s son, he will surely there\nfind his friends. A far-off land\neach man should visit who vaunts him brave.”\nHim then answering, Hrothgar spake:—\n“These words of thine the wisest God\nsent to thy soul! No sager counsel\nfrom so young in years e’er yet have I heard.\nThou art strong of main and in mind art wary,\nart wise in words! I ween indeed\nif ever it hap that Hrethel’s heir\nby spear be seized, by sword-grim battle,\nby illness or iron, thine elder and lord,\npeople’s leader, — and life be thine, —\nno seemlier man will the Sea-Geats find\nat all to choose for their chief and king,\nfor hoard-guard of heroes, if hold thou wilt\nthy kinsman’s kingdom! Thy keen mind pleases me\nthe longer the better, Beowulf loved!\nThou hast brought it about that both our peoples,\nsons of the Geat and Spear-Dane folk,\nshall have mutual peace, and from murderous strife,\nsuch as once they waged, from war refrain.\nLong as I rule this realm so wide,\nlet our hoards be common, let heroes with gold\neach other greet o’er the gannet’s-bath,\nand the ringed-prow bear o’er rolling waves\ntokens of love. I trow my landfolk\ntowards friend and foe are firmly joined,\nand honor they keep in the olden way.”\nTo him in the hall, then, Healfdene’s son\ngave treasures twelve, and the trust-of-earls\nbade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved,\nhale to his home, and in haste return.\nThen kissed the king of kin renowned,\nScyldings’ chieftain, that choicest thane,\nand fell on his neck. Fast flowed the tears\nof the hoary-headed. Heavy with winters,\nhe had chances twain, but he clung to this,   —\nthat each should look on the other again,\nand hear him in hall. Was this hero so dear to him.\nhis breast’s wild billows he banned in vain;\nsafe in his soul a secret longing,\nlocked in his mind, for that loved man\nburned in his blood. Then Beowulf strode,\nglad of his gold-gifts, the grass-plot o’er,\nwarrior blithe. The wave-roamer bode\nriding at anchor, its owner awaiting.\nAs they hastened onward, Hrothgar’s gift\nthey lauded at length. — ‘Twas a lord unpeered,\nevery way blameless, till age had broken\nit spareth no mortal — his splendid might.\nCAME now to ocean the ever-courageous\nhardy henchmen, their harness bearing,\nwoven war-sarks. The warden marked,\ntrusty as ever, the earl’s return.\nFrom the height of the hill no hostile words\nreached the guests as he rode to greet them;\nbut “Welcome!” he called to that Weder clan\nas the sheen-mailed spoilers to ship marched on.\nThen on the strand, with steeds and treasure\nand armor their roomy and ring-dight ship\nwas heavily laden: high its mast\nrose over Hrothgar’s hoarded gems.\nA sword to the boat-guard Beowulf gave,\nmounted with gold; on the mead-bench since\nhe was better esteemed, that blade possessing,\nheirloom old. — Their ocean-keel boarding,\nthey drove through the deep, and Daneland left.\nA sea-cloth was set, a sail with ropes,\nfirm to the mast; the flood-timbers moaned;   \nnor did wind over billows that wave-swimmer blow\nacross from her course. The craft sped on,\nfoam-necked it floated forth o’er the waves,\nkeel firm-bound over briny currents,\ntill they got them sight of the Geatish cliffs,\nhome-known headlands. High the boat,\nstirred by winds, on the strand updrove.\nHelpful at haven the harbor-guard stood,\nwho long already for loved companions\nby the water had waited and watched afar.\nHe bound to the beach the broad-bosomed ship\nwith anchor-bands, lest ocean-billows\nthat trusty timber should tear away.\nThen Beowulf bade them bear the treasure,\ngold and jewels; no journey far\nwas it thence to go to the giver of rings,\nHygelac Hrethling: at home he dwelt\nby the sea-wall close, himself and clan.\nHaughty that house, a hero the king,\nhigh the hall, and Hygd   right young,\nwise and wary, though winters few\nin those fortress walls she had found a home,\nHaereth’s daughter. Nor humble her ways,\nnor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men,\nof precious treasure. Not Thryth’s pride showed she,\nfolk-queen famed, or that fell deceit.\nWas none so daring that durst make bold\n(save her lord alone) of the liegemen dear\nthat lady full in the face to look,\nbut forged fetters he found his lot,\nbonds of death! And brief the respite;\nsoon as they seized him, his sword-doom was spoken,\nand the burnished blade a baleful murder\nproclaimed and closed. No queenly way\nfor woman to practise, though peerless she,\nthat the weaver-of-peace   from warrior dear\nby wrath and lying his life should reave!\nBut Hemming’s kinsman hindered this. —\nFor over their ale men also told\nthat of these folk-horrors fewer she wrought,\nonslaughts of evil, after she went,\ngold-decked bride, to the brave young prince,\natheling haughty, and Offa’s hall\no’er the fallow flood at her father’s bidding\nsafely sought, where since she prospered,\nroyal, throned, rich in goods,\nfain of the fair life fate had sent her,\nand leal in love to the lord of warriors.\nHe, of all heroes I heard of ever\nfrom sea to sea, of the sons of earth,\nmost excellent seemed. Hence Offa was praised\nfor his fighting and feeing by far-off men,\nthe spear-bold warrior; wisely he ruled\nover his empire. Eomer woke to him,\nhelp of heroes, Hemming’s kinsman,\nGrandson of Garmund, grim in war.\nHASTENED the hardy one, henchmen with him,\nsandy strand of the sea to tread\nand widespread ways. The world’s great candle,\nsun shone from south. They strode along\nwith sturdy steps to the spot they knew\nwhere the battle-king young, his burg within,\nslayer of Ongentheow, shared the rings,\nshelter-of-heroes. To Hygelac\nBeowulf’s coming was quickly told, —\nthat there in the court the clansmen’s refuge,\nthe shield-companion sound and alive,\nhale from the hero-play homeward strode.\nWith haste in the hall, by highest order,\nroom for the rovers was readily made.\nBy his sovran he sat, come safe from battle,\nkinsman by kinsman. His kindly lord\nhe first had greeted in gracious form,\nwith manly words. The mead dispensing,\ncame through the high hall Haereth’s daughter,\nwinsome to warriors, wine-cup bore\nto the hands of the heroes. Hygelac then\nhis comrade fairly with question plied\nin the lofty hall, sore longing to know\nwhat manner of sojourn the Sea-Geats made.\n“What came of thy quest, my kinsman Beowulf,\nwhen thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder\nbattle to seek o’er the briny sea,\ncombat in Heorot? Hrothgar couldst thou\naid at all, the honored chief,\nin his wide-known woes? With waves of care\nmy sad heart seethed; I sore mistrusted\nmy loved one’s venture: long I begged thee\nby no means to seek that slaughtering monster,\nbut suffer the South-Danes to settle their feud\nthemselves with Grendel. Now God be thanked\nthat safe and sound I can see thee now!”\nBeowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:—\n“‘Tis known and unhidden, Hygelac Lord,\nto many men, that meeting of ours,\nstruggle grim between Grendel and me,\nwhich we fought on the field where full too many\nsorrows he wrought for the Scylding-Victors,\nevils unending. These all I avenged.\nNo boast can be from breed of Grendel,\nany on earth, for that uproar at dawn,\nfrom the longest-lived of the loathsome race\nin fleshly fold! — But first I went\nHrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts,\nwhere Healfdene’s kinsman high-renowned,\nsoon as my purpose was plain to him,\nassigned me a seat by his son and heir.\nThe liegemen were lusty; my life-days never\nsuch merry men over mead in hall\nhave I heard under heaven! The high-born queen,\npeople’s peace-bringer, passed through the hall,\ncheered the young clansmen, clasps of gold,\nere she sought her seat, to sundry gave.\nOft to the heroes Hrothgar’s daughter,\nto earls in turn, the ale-cup tendered, —\nshe whom I heard these hall-companions\nFreawaru name, when fretted gold\nshe proffered the warriors. Promised is she,\ngold-decked maid, to the glad son of Froda.\nSage this seems to the Scylding’s-friend,\nkingdom’s-keeper: he counts it wise\nthe woman to wed so and ward off feud,\nstore of slaughter. But seldom ever\nwhen men are slain, does the murder-spear sink\nbut briefest while, though the bride be fair!   \n“Nor haply will like it the Heathobard lord,\nand as little each of his liegemen all,\nwhen a thane of the Danes, in that doughty throng,\ngoes with the lady along their hall,\nand on him the old-time heirlooms glisten\nhard and ring-decked, Heathobard’s treasure,\nweapons that once they wielded fair\nuntil they lost at the linden-play   \nliegeman leal and their lives as well.\nThen, over the ale, on this heirloom gazing,\nsome ash-wielder old who has all in mind\nthat spear-death of men,   — he is stern of mood,\nheavy at heart, — in the hero young\ntests the temper and tries the soul\nand war-hate wakens, with words like these:—\nCanst thou not, comrade, ken that sword\nwhich to the fray thy father carried\nin his final feud, ‘neath the fighting-mask,\ndearest of blades, when the Danish slew him\nand wielded the war-place on Withergild’s fall,\nafter havoc of heroes, those hardy Scyldings?\nNow, the son of a certain slaughtering Dane,\nproud of his treasure, paces this hall,\njoys in the killing, and carries the jewel   \nthat rightfully ought to be owned by thee!\nThus he urges and eggs him all the time\nwith keenest words, till occasion offers\nthat Freawaru’s thane, for his father’s deed,\nafter bite of brand in his blood must slumber,\nlosing his life; but that liegeman flies\nliving away, for the land he kens.\nAnd thus be broken on both their sides\noaths of the earls, when Ingeld’s breast\nwells with war-hate, and wife-love now\nafter the care-billows cooler grows.\n“So   I hold not high the Heathobards’ faith\ndue to the Danes, or their during love\nand pact of peace. — But I pass from that,\nturning to Grendel, O giver-of-treasure,\nand saying in full how the fight resulted,\nhand-fray of heroes. When heaven’s jewel\nhad fled o’er far fields, that fierce sprite came,\nnight-foe savage, to seek us out\nwhere safe and sound we sentried the hall.\nTo Hondscio then was that harassing deadly,\nhis fall there was fated. He first was slain,\ngirded warrior. Grendel on him\nturned murderous mouth, on our mighty kinsman,\nand all of the brave man’s body devoured.\nYet none the earlier, empty-handed,\nwould the bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of bale,\noutward go from the gold-decked hall:\nbut me he attacked in his terror of might,\nwith greedy hand grasped me. A glove hung by him   \nwide and wondrous, wound with bands;\nand in artful wise it all was wrought,\nby devilish craft, of dragon-skins.\nMe therein, an innocent man,\nthe fiendish foe was fain to thrust\nwith many another. He might not so,\nwhen I all angrily upright stood.\n‘Twere long to relate how that land-destroyer\nI paid in kind for his cruel deeds;\nyet there, my prince, this people of thine\ngot fame by my fighting. He fled away,\nand a little space his life preserved;\nbut there staid behind him his stronger hand\nleft in Heorot; heartsick thence\non the floor of the ocean that outcast fell.\nMe for this struggle the Scyldings’-friend\npaid in plenty with plates of gold,\nwith many a treasure, when morn had come\nand we all at the banquet-board sat down.\nThen was song and glee. The gray-haired Scylding,\nmuch tested, told of the times of yore.\nWhiles the hero his harp bestirred,\nwood-of-delight; now lays he chanted\nof sooth and sadness, or said aright\nlegends of wonder, the wide-hearted king;\nor for years of his youth he would yearn at times,\nfor strength of old struggles, now stricken with age,\nhoary hero: his heart surged full\nwhen, wise with winters, he wailed their flight.\nThus in the hall the whole of that day\nat ease we feasted, till fell o’er earth\nanother night. Anon full ready\nin greed of vengeance, Grendel’s mother\nset forth all doleful. Dead was her son\nthrough war-hate of Weders; now, woman monstrous\nwith fury fell a foeman she slew,\navenged her offspring. From Aeschere old,\nloyal councillor, life was gone;\nnor might they e’en, when morning broke,\nthose Danish people, their death-done comrade\nburn with brands, on balefire lay\nthe man they mourned. Under mountain stream\nshe had carried the corpse with cruel hands.\nFor Hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow\nof all that had laden the lord of his folk.\nThe leader then, by thy life, besought me\n(sad was his soul) in the sea-waves’ coil\nto play the hero and hazard my being\nfor glory of prowess: my guerdon he pledged.\nI then in the waters — ‘tis widely known —\nthat sea-floor-guardian savage found.\nHand-to-hand there a while we struggled;\nbillows welled blood; in the briny hall\nher head I hewed with a hardy blade\nfrom Grendel’s mother, — and gained my life,\nthough not without danger. My doom was not yet.\nThen the haven-of-heroes, Healfdene’s son,\ngave me in guerdon great gifts of price.\n“So held this king to the customs old,\nthat I wanted for nought in the wage I gained,\nthe meed of my might; he made me gifts,\nHealfdene’s heir, for my own disposal.\nNow to thee, my prince, I proffer them all,\ngladly give them. Thy grace alone\ncan find me favor. Few indeed\nhave I of kinsmen, save, Hygelac, thee!”\nThen he bade them bear him the boar-head standard,\nthe battle-helm high, and breastplate gray,\nthe splendid sword; then spake in form:—\n“Me this war-gear the wise old prince,\nHrothgar, gave, and his hest he added,\nthat its story be straightway said to thee. —\nA while it was held by Heorogar king,\nfor long time lord of the land of Scyldings;\nyet not to his son the sovran left it,\nto daring Heoroweard, — dear as he was to him,\nhis harness of battle. — Well hold thou it all!”\nAnd I heard that soon passed o’er the path of this treasure,\nall apple-fallow, four good steeds,\neach like the others, arms and horses\nhe gave to the king. So should kinsmen be,\nnot weave one another the net of wiles,\nor with deep-hid treachery death contrive\nfor neighbor and comrade. His nephew was ever\nby hardy Hygelac held full dear,\nand each kept watch o’er the other’s weal.\nI heard, too, the necklace to Hygd he presented,\nwonder-wrought treasure, which Wealhtheow gave him\nsovran’s daughter: three steeds he added,\nslender and saddle-gay. Since such gift\nthe gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen. \nThus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow\nas a man remarked for mighty deeds\nand acts of honor. At ale he slew not\ncomrade or kin; nor cruel his mood,\nthough of sons of earth his strength was greatest,\na glorious gift that God had sent\nthe splendid leader. Long was he spurned,\nand worthless by Geatish warriors held;\nhim at mead the master-of-clans\nfailed full oft to favor at all.\nSlack and shiftless the strong men deemed him,\nprofitless prince; but payment came,\nto the warrior honored, for all his woes. —\nThen the bulwark-of-earls   bade bring within,\nhardy chieftain, Hrethel’s heirloom\ngarnished with gold: no Geat e’er knew\nin shape of a sword a statelier prize.\nThe brand he laid in Beowulf’s lap;\nand of hides assigned him seven thousand,   \nwith house and high-seat. They held in common\nland alike by their line of birth,\ninheritance, home: but higher the king\nbecause of his rule o’er the realm itself.\nNow further it fell with the flight of years,\nwith harryings horrid, that Hygelac perished,   \nand Heardred, too, by hewing of swords\nunder the shield-wall slaughtered lay,\nwhen him at the van of his victor-folk\nsought hardy heroes, Heatho-Scilfings,\nin arms o’erwhelming Hereric’s nephew.\nThen Beowulf came as king this broad\nrealm to wield; and he ruled it well\nfifty winters,   a wise old prince,\nwarding his land, until One began\nin the dark of night, a Dragon, to rage.\nIn the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded,\nin the stone-barrow steep. A strait path reached it,\nunknown to mortals. Some man, however,\ncame by chance that cave within\nto the heathen hoard.   In hand he took\na golden goblet, nor gave he it back,\nstole with it away, while the watcher slept,\nby thievish wiles: for the warden’s wrath\nprince and people must pay betimes!\nTHAT way he went with no will of his own,\nin danger of life, to the dragon’s hoard,\nbut for pressure of peril, some prince’s thane.\nHe fled in fear the fatal scourge,\nseeking shelter, a sinful man,\nand entered in. At the awful sight\ntottered that guest, and terror seized him;\nyet the wretched fugitive rallied anon\nfrom fright and fear ere he fled away,\nand took the cup from that treasure-hoard.\nOf such besides there was store enough,\nheirlooms old, the earth below,\nwhich some earl forgotten, in ancient years,\nleft the last of his lofty race,\nheedfully there had hidden away,\ndearest treasure. For death of yore\nhad hurried all hence; and he alone\nleft to live, the last of the clan,\nweeping his friends, yet wished to bide\nwarding the treasure, his one delight,\nthough brief his respite. The barrow, new-ready,\nto strand and sea-waves stood anear,\nhard by the headland, hidden and closed;\nthere laid within it his lordly heirlooms\nand heaped hoard of heavy gold\nthat warden of rings. Few words he spake:\n“Now hold thou, earth, since heroes may not,\nwhat earls have owned! Lo, erst from thee\nbrave men brought it! But battle-death seized\nand cruel killing my clansmen all,\nrobbed them of life and a liegeman’s joys.\nNone have I left to lift the sword,\nor to cleanse the carven cup of price,\nbeaker bright. My brave are gone.\nAnd the helmet hard, all haughty with gold,\nshall part from its plating. Polishers sleep\nwho could brighten and burnish the battle-mask;\nand those weeds of war that were wont to brave\nover bicker of shields the bite of steel\nrust with their bearer. The ringed mail\nfares not far with famous chieftain,\nat side of hero! No harp’s delight,\nno glee-wood’s gladness! No good hawk now\nflies through the hall! Nor horses fleet\nstamp in the burgstead! Battle and death\nthe flower of my race have reft away.”\nMournful of mood, thus he moaned his woe,\nalone, for them all, and unblithe wept\nby day and by night, till death’s fell wave\no’erwhelmed his heart. His hoard-of-bliss\nthat old ill-doer open found,\nwho, blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth,\nnaked foe-dragon flying by night\nfolded in fire: the folk of earth\ndread him sore. ‘Tis his doom to seek\nhoard in the graves, and heathen gold\nto watch, many-wintered: nor wins he thereby!\nPowerful this plague-of-the-people thus\nheld the house of the hoard in earth\nthree hundred winters; till One aroused\nwrath in his breast, to the ruler bearing\nthat costly cup, and the king implored\nfor bond of peace. So the barrow was plundered,\nborne off was booty. His boon was granted\nthat wretched man; and his ruler saw\nfirst time what was fashioned in far-off days.\nWhen the dragon awoke, new woe was kindled.\nO’er the stone he snuffed. The stark-heart found\nfootprint of foe who so far had gone\nin his hidden craft by the creature’s head. —\nSo may the undoomed easily flee\nevils and exile, if only he gain\nthe grace of The Wielder! — That warden of gold\no’er the ground went seeking, greedy to find\nthe man who wrought him such wrong in sleep.\nSavage and burning, the barrow he circled\nall without; nor was any there,\nnone in the waste.... Yet war he desired,\nwas eager for battle. The barrow he entered,\nsought the cup, and discovered soon\nthat some one of mortals had searched his treasure,\nhis lordly gold. The guardian waited\nill-enduring till evening came;\nboiling with wrath was the barrow’s keeper,\nand fain with flame the foe to pay\nfor the dear cup’s loss. — Now day was fled\nas the worm had wished. By its wall no more\nwas it glad to bide, but burning flew\nfolded in flame: a fearful beginning\nfor sons of the soil; and soon it came,\nin the doom of their lord, to a dreadful end.\nTHEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out,\nand bright homes burned. The blaze stood high\nall landsfolk frighting. No living thing\nwould that loathly one leave as aloft it flew.\nWide was the dragon’s warring seen,\nits fiendish fury far and near,\nas the grim destroyer those Geatish people\nhated and hounded. To hidden lair,\nto its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn.\nFolk of the land it had lapped in flame,\nwith bale and brand. In its barrow it trusted,\nits battling and bulwarks: that boast was vain!\nTo Beowulf then the bale was told\nquickly and truly: the king’s own home,\nof buildings the best, in brand-waves melted,\nthat gift-throne of Geats. To the good old man\nsad in heart, ‘twas heaviest sorrow.\nThe sage assumed that his sovran God\nhe had angered, breaking ancient law,\nand embittered the Lord. His breast within\nwith black thoughts welled, as his wont was never.\nThe folk’s own fastness that fiery dragon\nwith flame had destroyed, and the stronghold all\nwashed by waves; but the warlike king,\nprince of the Weders, plotted vengeance.\nWarriors’-bulwark, he bade them work\nall of iron — the earl’s commander —\na war-shield wondrous: well he knew\nthat forest-wood against fire were worthless,\nlinden could aid not. — Atheling brave,\nhe was fated to finish this fleeting life,   \nhis days on earth, and the dragon with him,\nthough long it had watched o’er the wealth of the hoard! —\nShame he reckoned it, sharer-of-rings,\nto follow the flyer-afar with a host,\na broad-flung band; nor the battle feared he,\nnor deemed he dreadful the dragon’s warring,\nits vigor and valor: ventures desperate\nhe had passed a-plenty, and perils of war,\ncontest-crash, since, conqueror proud,\nHrothgar’s hall he had wholly purged,\nand in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel,\nloathsome breed! Not least was that\nof hand-to-hand fights where Hygelac fell,\nwhen the ruler of Geats in rush of battle,\nlord of his folk, in the Frisian land,\nson of Hrethel, by sword-draughts died,\nby brands down-beaten. Thence Beowulf fled\nthrough strength of himself and his swimming power,\nthough alone, and his arms were laden with thirty\ncoats of mail, when he came to the sea!\nNor yet might Hetwaras   haughtily boast\ntheir craft of contest, who carried against him\nshields to the fight: but few escaped\nfrom strife with the hero to seek their homes!\nThen swam over ocean Ecgtheow’s son\nlonely and sorrowful, seeking his land,\nwhere Hygd made him offer of hoard and realm,\nrings and royal-seat, reckoning naught\nthe strength of her son to save their kingdom\nfrom hostile hordes, after Hygelac’s death.\nNo sooner for this could the stricken ones\nin any wise move that atheling’s mind\nover young Heardred’s head as lord\nand ruler of all the realm to be:\nyet the hero upheld him with helpful words,\naided in honor, till, older grown,\nhe wielded the Weder-Geats. — Wandering exiles\nsought him o’er seas, the sons of Ohtere,\nwho had spurned the sway of the Scylfings’-helmet,\nthe bravest and best that broke the rings,\nin Swedish land, of the sea-kings’ line,\nhaughty hero.   Hence Heardred’s end.\nFor shelter he gave them, sword-death came,\nthe blade’s fell blow, to bairn of Hygelac;\nbut the son of Ongentheow sought again\nhouse and home when Heardred fell,\nleaving Beowulf lord of Geats\nand gift-seat’s master. — A good king he!\nTHE fall of his lord he was fain to requite\nin after days; and to Eadgils he proved\nfriend to the friendless, and forces sent\nover the sea to the son of Ohtere,\nweapons and warriors: well repaid he\nthose care-paths cold when the king he slew.   \nThus safe through struggles the son of Ecgtheow\nhad passed a plenty, through perils dire,\nwith daring deeds, till this day was come\nthat doomed him now with the dragon to strive.\nWith comrades eleven the lord of Geats\nswollen in rage went seeking the dragon.\nHe had heard whence all the harm arose\nand the killing of clansmen; that cup of price\non the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder.\nIn the throng was this one thirteenth man,\nstarter of all the strife and ill,\ncare-laden captive; cringing thence\nforced and reluctant, he led them on\ntill he came in ken of that cavern-hall,\nthe barrow delved near billowy surges,\nflood of ocean. Within ‘twas full\nof wire-gold and jewels; a jealous warden,\nwarrior trusty, the treasures held,\nlurked in his lair. Not light the task\nof entrance for any of earth-born men!\nSat on the headland the hero king,\nspake words of hail to his hearth-companions,\ngold-friend of Geats. All gloomy his soul,\nwavering, death-bound. Wyrd full nigh\nstood ready to greet the gray-haired man,\nto seize his soul-hoard, sunder apart\nlife and body. Not long would be\nthe warrior’s spirit enwound with flesh.\nBeowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:—\n“Through store of struggles I strove in youth,\nmighty feuds; I mind them all.\nI was seven years old when the sovran of rings,\nfriend-of-his-folk, from my father took me,\nhad me, and held me, Hrethel the king,\nwith food and fee, faithful in kinship.\nNe’er, while I lived there, he loathlier found me,\nbairn in the burg, than his birthright sons,\nHerebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine.\nFor the eldest of these, by unmeet chance,\nby kinsman’s deed, was the death-bed strewn,\nwhen Haethcyn killed him with horny bow,\nhis own dear liege laid low with an arrow,\nmissed the mark and his mate shot down,\none brother the other, with bloody shaft.\nA feeless fight,   and a fearful sin,\nhorror to Hrethel; yet, hard as it was,\nunavenged must the atheling die!\nToo awful it is for an aged man\nto bide and bear, that his bairn so young\nrides on the gallows. A rime he makes,\nsorrow-song for his son there hanging\nas rapture of ravens; no rescue now\ncan come from the old, disabled man!\nStill is he minded, as morning breaks,\nof the heir gone elsewhere;   another he hopes not\nhe will bide to see his burg within\nas ward for his wealth, now the one has found\ndoom of death that the deed incurred.\nForlorn he looks on the lodge of his son,\nwine-hall waste and wind-swept chambers\nreft of revel. The rider sleepeth,\nthe hero, far-hidden;   no harp resounds,\nin the courts no wassail, as once was heard.\n“THEN he goes to his chamber, a grief-song chants\nalone for his lost. Too large all seems,\nhomestead and house. So the helmet-of-Weders\nhid in his heart for Herebeald\nwaves of woe. No way could he take\nto avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul;\nnor e’en could he harass that hero at all\nwith loathing deed, though he loved him not.\nAnd so for the sorrow his soul endured,\nmen’s gladness he gave up and God’s light chose.\nLands and cities he left his sons\n(as the wealthy do) when he went from earth.\nThere was strife and struggle ‘twixt Swede and Geat\no’er the width of waters; war arose,\nhard battle-horror, when Hrethel died,\nand Ongentheow’s offspring grew\nstrife-keen, bold, nor brooked o’er the seas\npact of peace, but pushed their hosts\nto harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh.\nMen of my folk for that feud had vengeance,\nfor woful war (‘tis widely known),\nthough one of them bought it with blood of his heart,\na bargain hard: for Haethcyn proved\nfatal that fray, for the first-of-Geats.\nAt morn, I heard, was the murderer killed\nby kinsman for kinsman,   with clash of sword,\nwhen Ongentheow met Eofor there.\nWide split the war-helm: wan he fell,\nhoary Scylfing; the hand that smote him\nof feud was mindful, nor flinched from the death-blow.\n— “For all that he   gave me, my gleaming sword\nrepaid him at war, — such power I wielded, —\nfor lordly treasure: with land he entrusted me,\nhomestead and house. He had no need\nfrom Swedish realm, or from Spear-Dane folk,\nor from men of the Gifths, to get him help, —\nsome warrior worse for wage to buy!\nEver I fought in the front of all,\nsole to the fore; and so shall I fight\nwhile I bide in life and this blade shall last\nthat early and late hath loyal proved\nsince for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell,\nslain by my hand, the Hugas’ champion.\nNor fared he thence to the Frisian king\nwith the booty back, and breast-adornments;\nbut, slain in struggle, that standard-bearer\nfell, atheling brave. Not with blade was he slain,\nbut his bones were broken by brawny gripe,\nhis heart-waves stilled. — The sword-edge now,\nhard blade and my hand, for the hoard shall strive.”\nBeowulf spake, and a battle-vow made\nhis last of all: “I have lived through many\nwars in my youth; now once again,\nold folk-defender, feud will I seek,\ndo doughty deeds, if the dark destroyer\nforth from his cavern come to fight me!”\nThen hailed he the helmeted heroes all,\nfor the last time greeting his liegemen dear,\ncomrades of war: “I should carry no weapon,\nno sword to the serpent, if sure I knew\nhow, with such enemy, else my vows\nI could gain as I did in Grendel’s day.\nBut fire in this fight I must fear me now,\nand poisonous breath; so I bring with me\nbreastplate and board.   From the barrow’s keeper\nno footbreadth flee I. One fight shall end\nour war by the wall, as Wyrd allots,\nall mankind’s master. My mood is bold\nbut forbears to boast o’er this battling-flyer.\n— Now abide by the barrow, ye breastplate-mailed,\nye heroes in harness, which of us twain\nbetter from battle-rush bear his wounds.\nWait ye the finish. The fight is not yours,\nnor meet for any but me alone\nto measure might with this monster here\nand play the hero. Hardily I\nshall win that wealth, or war shall seize,\ncruel killing, your king and lord!”\nUp stood then with shield the sturdy champion,\nstayed by the strength of his single manhood,\nand hardy ‘neath helmet his harness bore\nunder cleft of the cliffs: no coward’s path!\nSoon spied by the wall that warrior chief,\nsurvivor of many a victory-field\nwhere foemen fought with furious clashings,\nan arch of stone; and within, a stream\nthat broke from the barrow. The brooklet’s wave\nwas hot with fire. The hoard that way\nhe never could hope unharmed to near,\nor endure those deeps,   for the dragon’s flame.\nThen let from his breast, for he burst with rage,\nthe Weder-Geat prince a word outgo;\nstormed the stark-heart; stern went ringing\nand clear his cry ‘neath the cliff-rocks gray.\nThe hoard-guard heard a human voice;\nhis rage was enkindled. No respite now\nfor pact of peace! The poison-breath\nof that foul worm first came forth from the cave,\nhot reek-of-fight: the rocks resounded.\nStout by the stone-way his shield he raised,\nlord of the Geats, against the loathed-one;\nwhile with courage keen that coiled foe\ncame seeking strife. The sturdy king\nhad drawn his sword, not dull of edge,\nheirloom old; and each of the two\nfelt fear of his foe, though fierce their mood.\nStoutly stood with his shield high-raised\nthe warrior king, as the worm now coiled\ntogether amain: the mailed-one waited.\nNow, spire by spire, fast sped and glided\nthat blazing serpent. The shield protected,\nsoul and body a shorter while\nfor the hero-king than his heart desired,\ncould his will have wielded the welcome respite\nbut once in his life! But Wyrd denied it,\nand victory’s honors. — His arm he lifted\nlord of the Geats, the grim foe smote\nwith atheling’s heirloom. Its edge was turned\nbrown blade, on the bone, and bit more feebly\nthan its noble master had need of then\nin his baleful stress. — Then the barrow’s keeper\nwaxed full wild for that weighty blow,\ncast deadly flames; wide drove and far\nthose vicious fires. No victor’s glory\nthe Geats’ lord boasted; his brand had failed,\nnaked in battle, as never it should,\nexcellent iron! — ‘Twas no easy path\nthat Ecgtheow’s honored heir must tread\nover the plain to the place of the foe;\nfor against his will he must win a home\nelsewhere far, as must all men, leaving\nthis lapsing life! — Not long it was\nere those champions grimly closed again.\nThe hoard-guard was heartened; high heaved his breast\nonce more; and by peril was pressed again,\nenfolded in flames, the folk-commander!\nNor yet about him his band of comrades,\nsons of athelings, armed stood\nwith warlike front: to the woods they bent them,\ntheir lives to save. But the soul of one\nwith care was cumbered. Kinship true\ncan never be marred in a noble mind!\nWIGLAF his name was, Weohstan’s son,\nlinden-thane loved, the lord of Scylfings,\nAelfhere’s kinsman. His king he now saw\nwith heat under helmet hard oppressed.\nHe minded the prizes his prince had given him,\nwealthy seat of the Waegmunding line,\nand folk-rights that his father owned\nNot long he lingered. The linden yellow,\nhis shield, he seized; the old sword he drew: —\nas heirloom of Eanmund earth-dwellers knew it,\nwho was slain by the sword-edge, son of Ohtere,\nfriendless exile, erst in fray\nkilled by Weohstan, who won for his kin\nbrown-bright helmet, breastplate ringed,\nold sword of Eotens, Onela’s gift,\nweeds of war of the warrior-thane,\nbattle-gear brave: though a brother’s child\nhad been felled, the feud was unfelt by Onela.   \nFor winters this war-gear Weohstan kept,\nbreastplate and board, till his bairn had grown\nearlship to earn as the old sire did:\nthen he gave him, mid Geats, the gear of battle,\nportion huge, when he passed from life,\nfared aged forth. For the first time now\nwith his leader-lord the liegeman young\nwas bidden to share the shock of battle.\nNeither softened his soul, nor the sire’s bequest\nweakened in war.   So the worm found out\nwhen once in fight the foes had met!\nWiglaf spake, — and his words were sage;\nsad in spirit, he said to his comrades:—\n“I remember the time, when mead we took,\nwhat promise we made to this prince of ours\nin the banquet-hall, to our breaker-of-rings,\nfor gear of combat to give him requital,\nfor hard-sword and helmet, if hap should bring\nstress of this sort! Himself who chose us\nfrom all his army to aid him now,\nurged us to glory, and gave these treasures,\nbecause he counted us keen with the spear\nand hardy ‘neath helm, though this hero-work\nour leader hoped unhelped and alone\nto finish for us, — folk-defender\nwho hath got him glory greater than all men\nfor daring deeds! Now the day is come\nthat our noble master has need of the might\nof warriors stout. Let us stride along\nthe hero to help while the heat is about him\nglowing and grim! For God is my witness\nI am far more fain the fire should seize\nalong with my lord these limbs of mine!   \nUnsuiting it seems our shields to bear\nhomeward hence, save here we essay\nto fell the foe and defend the life\nof the Weders’ lord. I wot ‘twere shame\non the law of our land if alone the king\nout of Geatish warriors woe endured\nand sank in the struggle! My sword and helmet,\nbreastplate and board, for us both shall serve!”\nThrough slaughter-reek strode he to succor his chieftain,\nhis battle-helm bore, and brief words spake:—\n“Beowulf dearest, do all bravely,\nas in youthful days of yore thou vowedst\nthat while life should last thou wouldst let no wise\nthy glory droop! Now, great in deeds,\natheling steadfast, with all thy strength\nshield thy life! I will stand to help thee.”\nAt the words the worm came once again,\nmurderous monster mad with rage,\nwith fire-billows flaming, its foes to seek,\nthe hated men. In heat-waves burned\nthat board   to the boss, and the breastplate failed\nto shelter at all the spear-thane young.\nYet quickly under his kinsman’s shield\nwent eager the earl, since his own was now\nall burned by the blaze. The bold king again\nhad mind of his glory: with might his glaive\nwas driven into the dragon’s head, —\nblow nerved by hate. But Naegling   was shivered,\nbroken in battle was Beowulf’s sword,\nold and gray. ‘Twas granted him not\nthat ever the edge of iron at all\ncould help him at strife: too strong was his hand,\nso the tale is told, and he tried too far\nwith strength of stroke all swords he wielded,\nthough sturdy their steel: they steaded him nought.\nThen for the third time thought on its feud\nthat folk-destroyer, fire-dread dragon,\nand rushed on the hero, where room allowed,\nbattle-grim, burning; its bitter teeth\nclosed on his neck, and covered him\nwith waves of blood from his breast that welled.\n‘TWAS now, men say, in his sovran’s need\nthat the earl made known his noble strain,\ncraft and keenness and courage enduring.\nHeedless of harm, though his hand was burned,\nhardy-hearted, he helped his kinsman.\nA little lower the loathsome beast\nhe smote with sword; his steel drove in\nbright and burnished; that blaze began\nto lose and lessen. At last the king\nwielded his wits again, war-knife drew,\na biting blade by his breastplate hanging,\nand the Weders’-helm smote that worm asunder,\nfelled the foe, flung forth its life.\nSo had they killed it, kinsmen both,\nathelings twain: thus an earl should be\nin danger’s day! — Of deeds of valor\nthis conqueror’s-hour of the king was last,\nof his work in the world. The wound began,\nwhich that dragon-of-earth had erst inflicted,\nto swell and smart; and soon he found\nin his breast was boiling, baleful and deep,\npain of poison. The prince walked on,\nwise in his thought, to the wall of rock;\nthen sat, and stared at the structure of giants,\nwhere arch of stone and steadfast column\nupheld forever that hall in earth.\nYet here must the hand of the henchman peerless\nlave with water his winsome lord,\nthe king and conqueror covered with blood,\nwith struggle spent, and unspan his helmet.\nBeowulf spake in spite of his hurt,\nhis mortal wound; full well he knew\nhis portion now was past and gone\nof earthly bliss, and all had fled\nof his file of days, and death was near:\n“I would fain bestow on son of mine\nthis gear of war, were given me now\nthat any heir should after me come\nof my proper blood. This people I ruled\nfifty winters. No folk-king was there,\nnone at all, of the neighboring clans\nwho war would wage me with ‘warriors’-friends’   \nand threat me with horrors. At home I bided\nwhat fate might come, and I cared for mine own;\nfeuds I sought not, nor falsely swore\never on oath. For all these things,\nthough fatally wounded, fain am I!\nFrom the Ruler-of-Man no wrath shall seize me,\nwhen life from my frame must flee away,\nfor killing of kinsmen! Now quickly go\nand gaze on that hoard ‘neath the hoary rock,\nWiglaf loved, now the worm lies low,\nsleeps, heart-sore, of his spoil bereaved.\nAnd fare in haste. I would fain behold\nthe gorgeous heirlooms, golden store,\nhave joy in the jewels and gems, lay down\nsoftlier for sight of this splendid hoard\nmy life and the lordship I long have held.”\nI HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan\nat wish and word of his wounded king, —\nwar-sick warrior, — woven mail-coat,\nbattle-sark, bore ‘neath the barrow’s roof.\nThen the clansman keen, of conquest proud,\npassing the seat,   saw store of jewels\nand glistening gold the ground along;\nby the wall were marvels, and many a vessel\nin the den of the dragon, the dawn-flier old:\nunburnished bowls of bygone men\nreft of richness; rusty helms\nof the olden age; and arm-rings many\nwondrously woven. — Such wealth of gold,\nbooty from barrow, can burden with pride\neach human wight: let him hide it who will! —\nHis glance too fell on a gold-wove banner\nhigh o’er the hoard, of handiwork noblest,\nbrilliantly broidered; so bright its gleam,\nall the earth-floor he easily saw\nand viewed all these vessels. No vestige now\nwas seen of the serpent: the sword had ta’en him.\nThen, I heard, the hill of its hoard was reft,\nold work of giants, by one alone;\nhe burdened his bosom with beakers and plate\nat his own good will, and the ensign took,\nbrightest of beacons. — The blade of his lord\n— its edge was iron — had injured deep\none that guarded the golden hoard\nmany a year and its murder-fire\nspread hot round the barrow in horror-billows\nat midnight hour, till it met its doom.\nHasted the herald, the hoard so spurred him\nhis track to retrace; he was troubled by doubt,\nhigh-souled hero, if haply he’d find\nalive, where he left him, the lord of Weders,\nweakening fast by the wall of the cave.\nSo he carried the load. His lord and king\nhe found all bleeding, famous chief\nat the lapse of life. The liegeman again\nplashed him with water, till point of word\nbroke through the breast-hoard. Beowulf spake,\nsage and sad, as he stared at the gold. —\n“For the gold and treasure, to God my thanks,\nto the Wielder-of-Wonders, with words I say,\nfor what I behold, to Heaven’s Lord,\nfor the grace that I give such gifts to my folk\nor ever the day of my death be run!\nNow I’ve bartered here for booty of treasure\nthe last of my life, so look ye well\nto the needs of my land! No longer I tarry.\nA barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise\nfor my ashes. ‘Twill shine by the shore of the flood,\nto folk of mine memorial fair\non Hrones Headland high uplifted,\nthat ocean-wanderers oft may hail\nBeowulf’s Barrow, as back from far\nthey drive their keels o’er the darkling wave.”\nFrom his neck he unclasped the collar of gold,\nvalorous king, to his vassal gave it\nwith bright-gold helmet, breastplate, and ring,\nto the youthful thane: bade him use them in joy.\n“Thou art end and remnant of all our race\nthe Waegmunding name. For Wyrd hath swept them,\nall my line, to the land of doom,\nearls in their glory: I after them go.”\nThis word was the last which the wise old man\nharbored in heart ere hot death-waves\nof balefire he chose. From his bosom fled\nhis soul to seek the saints’ reward.\nIT was heavy hap for that hero young\non his lord beloved to look and find him\nlying on earth with life at end,\nsorrowful sight. But the slayer too,\nawful earth-dragon, empty of breath,\nlay felled in fight, nor, fain of its treasure,\ncould the writhing monster rule it more.\nFor edges of iron had ended its days,\nhard and battle-sharp, hammers’ leaving;   \nand that flier-afar had fallen to ground\nhushed by its hurt, its hoard all near,\nno longer lusty aloft to whirl\nat midnight, making its merriment seen,\nproud of its prizes: prone it sank\nby the handiwork of the hero-king.\nForsooth among folk but few achieve,\n— though sturdy and strong, as stories tell me,\nand never so daring in deed of valor, —\nthe perilous breath of a poison-foe\nto brave, and to rush on the ring-board hall,\nwhenever his watch the warden keeps\nbold in the barrow. Beowulf paid\nthe price of death for that precious hoard;\nand each of the foes had found the end\nof this fleeting life. Befell erelong\nthat the laggards in war the wood had left,\ntrothbreakers, cowards, ten together,\nfearing before to flourish a spear\nin the sore distress of their sovran lord.\nNow in their shame their shields they carried,\narmor of fight, where the old man lay;\nand they gazed on Wiglaf. Wearied he sat\nat his sovran’s shoulder, shieldsman good,\nto wake him with water.   Nowise it availed.\nThough well he wished it, in world no more\ncould he barrier life for that leader-of-battles\nnor baffle the will of all-wielding God.\nDoom of the Lord was law o’er the deeds\nof every man, as it is to-day.\nGrim was the answer, easy to get,\nfrom the youth for those that had yielded to fear!\nWiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan, —\nmournful he looked on those men unloved:—\n“Who sooth will speak, can say indeed\nthat the ruler who gave you golden rings\nand the harness of war in which ye stand\n— for he at ale-bench often-times\nbestowed on hall-folk helm and breastplate,\nlord to liegemen, the likeliest gear\nwhich near of far he could find to give, —\nthrew away and wasted these weeds of battle,\non men who failed when the foemen came!\nNot at all could the king of his comrades-in-arms\nventure to vaunt, though the Victory-Wielder,\nGod, gave him grace that he got revenge\nsole with his sword in stress and need.\nTo rescue his life, ‘twas little that I\ncould serve him in struggle; yet shift I made\n(hopeless it seemed) to help my kinsman.\nIts strength ever waned, when with weapon I struck\nthat fatal foe, and the fire less strongly\nflowed from its head. — Too few the heroes\nin throe of contest that thronged to our king!\nNow gift of treasure and girding of sword,\njoy of the house and home-delight\nshall fail your folk; his freehold-land\nevery clansman within your kin\nshall lose and leave, when lords highborn\nhear afar of that flight of yours,\na fameless deed. Yea, death is better\nfor liegemen all than a life of shame!”\nTHAT battle-toil bade he at burg to announce,\nat the fort on the cliff, where, full of sorrow,\nall the morning earls had sat,\ndaring shieldsmen, in doubt of twain:\nwould they wail as dead, or welcome home,\ntheir lord beloved? Little   kept back\nof the tidings new, but told them all,\nthe herald that up the headland rode. —\n“Now the willing-giver to Weder folk\nin death-bed lies; the Lord of Geats\non the slaughter-bed sleeps by the serpent’s deed!\nAnd beside him is stretched that slayer-of-men\nwith knife-wounds sick:   no sword availed\non the awesome thing in any wise\nto work a wound. There Wiglaf sitteth,\nWeohstan’s bairn, by Beowulf’s side,\nthe living earl by the other dead,\nand heavy of heart a head-watch   keeps\no’er friend and foe. — Now our folk may look\nfor waging of war when once unhidden\nto Frisian and Frank the fall of the king\nis spread afar. — The strife began\nwhen hot on the Hugas   Hygelac fell\nand fared with his fleet to the Frisian land.\nHim there the Hetwaras humbled in war,\nplied with such prowess their power o’erwhelming\nthat the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it\nand fell in fight. To his friends no wise\ncould that earl give treasure! And ever since\nthe Merowings’ favor has failed us wholly.\nNor aught expect I of peace and faith\nfrom Swedish folk. ‘Twas spread afar\nhow Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood\nHaethcyn Hrethling of hope and life,\nwhen the folk of Geats for the first time sought\nin wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.\nSoon the sage old sire   of Ohtere,\nancient and awful, gave answering blow;\nthe sea-king   he slew, and his spouse redeemed,\nhis good wife rescued, though robbed of her gold,\nmother of Ohtere and Onela.\nThen he followed his foes, who fled before him\nsore beset and stole their way,\nbereft of a ruler, to Ravenswood.\nWith his host he besieged there what swords had left,\nthe weary and wounded; woes he threatened\nthe whole night through to that hard-pressed throng:\nsome with the morrow his sword should kill,\nsome should go to the gallows-tree\nfor rapture of ravens. But rescue came\nwith dawn of day for those desperate men\nwhen they heard the horn of Hygelac sound,\ntones of his trumpet; the trusty king\nhad followed their trail with faithful band.\nTHE bloody swath of Swedes and Geats\nand the storm of their strife, were seen afar,\nhow folk against folk the fight had wakened.\nThe ancient king with his atheling band\nsought his citadel, sorrowing much:\nOngentheow earl went up to his burg.\nHe had tested Hygelac’s hardihood,\nthe proud one’s prowess, would prove it no longer,\ndefied no more those fighting-wanderers\nnor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard,\nhis bairn and his bride: so he bent him again,\nold, to his earth-walls. Yet after him came\nwith slaughter for Swedes the standards of Hygelac\no’er peaceful plains in pride advancing,\ntill Hrethelings fought in the fenced town.   \nThen Ongentheow with edge of sword,\nthe hoary-bearded, was held at bay,\nand the folk-king there was forced to suffer\nEofor’s anger. In ire, at the king\nWulf Wonreding with weapon struck;\nand the chieftain’s blood, for that blow, in streams\nflowed ‘neath his hair. No fear felt he,\nstout old Scylfing, but straightway repaid\nin better bargain that bitter stroke\nand faced his foe with fell intent.\nNor swift enough was the son of Wonred\nanswer to render the aged chief;\ntoo soon on his head the helm was cloven;\nblood-bedecked he bowed to earth,\nand fell adown; not doomed was he yet,\nand well he waxed, though the wound was sore.\nThen the hardy Hygelac-thane,   \nwhen his brother fell, with broad brand smote,\ngiants’ sword crashing through giants’-helm\nacross the shield-wall: sank the king,\nhis folk’s old herdsman, fatally hurt.\nThere were many to bind the brother’s wounds\nand lift him, fast as fate allowed\nhis people to wield the place-of-war.\nBut Eofor took from Ongentheow,\nearl from other, the iron-breastplate,\nhard sword hilted, and helmet too,\nand the hoar-chief’s harness to Hygelac carried,\nwho took the trappings, and truly promised\nrich fee ‘mid folk, — and fulfilled it so.\nFor that grim strife gave the Geatish lord,\nHrethel’s offspring, when home he came,\nto Eofor and Wulf a wealth of treasure,\nEach of them had a hundred thousand   \nin land and linked rings; nor at less price reckoned\nmid-earth men such mighty deeds!\nAnd to Eofor he gave his only daughter\nin pledge of grace, the pride of his home.\n“Such is the feud, the foeman’s rage,\ndeath-hate of men: so I deem it sure\nthat the Swedish folk will seek us home\nfor this fall of their friends, the fighting-Scylfings,\nwhen once they learn that our warrior leader\nlifeless lies, who land and hoard\never defended from all his foes,\nfurthered his folk’s weal, finished his course\na hardy hero. — Now haste is best,\nthat we go to gaze on our Geatish lord,\nand bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings\nto the funeral pyre. No fragments merely\nshall burn with the warrior. Wealth of jewels,\ngold untold and gained in terror,\ntreasure at last with his life obtained,\nall of that booty the brands shall take,\nfire shall eat it. No earl must carry\nmemorial jewel. No maiden fair\nshall wreathe her neck with noble ring:\nnay, sad in spirit and shorn of her gold,\noft shall she pass o’er paths of exile\nnow our lord all laughter has laid aside,\nall mirth and revel. Many a spear\nmorning-cold shall be clasped amain,\nlifted aloft; nor shall lilt of harp\nthose warriors wake; but the wan-hued raven,\nfain o’er the fallen, his feast shall praise\nand boast to the eagle how bravely he ate\nwhen he and the wolf were wasting the slain.”\nSo he told his sorrowful tidings,\nand little   he lied, the loyal man\nof word or of work. The warriors rose;\nsad, they climbed to the Cliff-of-Eagles,\nwent, welling with tears, the wonder to view.\nFound on the sand there, stretched at rest,\ntheir lifeless lord, who had lavished rings\nof old upon them. Ending-day\nhad dawned on the doughty-one; death had seized\nin woful slaughter the Weders’ king.\nThere saw they, besides, the strangest being,\nloathsome, lying their leader near,\nprone on the field. The fiery dragon,\nfearful fiend, with flame was scorched.\nReckoned by feet, it was fifty measures\nin length as it lay. Aloft erewhile\nit had revelled by night, and anon come back,\nseeking its den; now in death’s sure clutch\nit had come to the end of its earth-hall joys.\nBy it there stood the stoups and jars;\ndishes lay there, and dear-decked swords\neaten with rust, as, on earth’s lap resting,\na thousand winters they waited there.\nFor all that heritage huge, that gold\nof bygone men, was bound by a spell,   \nso the treasure-hall could be touched by none\nof human kind, — save that Heaven’s King,\nGod himself, might give whom he would,\nHelper of Heroes, the hoard to open, —\neven such a man as seemed to him meet.\nA PERILOUS path, it proved, he   trod\nwho heinously hid, that hall within,\nwealth under wall! Its watcher had killed\none of a few,   and the feud was avenged\nin woful fashion. Wondrous seems it,\nwhat manner a man of might and valor\noft ends his life, when the earl no longer\nin mead-hall may live with loving friends.\nSo Beowulf, when that barrow’s warden\nhe sought, and the struggle; himself knew not\nin what wise he should wend from the world at last.\nFor   princes potent, who placed the gold,\nwith a curse to doomsday covered it deep,\nso that marked with sin the man should be,\nhedged with horrors, in hell-bonds fast,\nracked with plagues, who should rob their hoard.\nYet no greed for gold, but the grace of heaven,\never the king had kept in view.   \nWiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan:—\n“At the mandate of one, oft warriors many\nsorrow must suffer; and so must we.\nThe people’s-shepherd showed not aught\nof care for our counsel, king beloved!\nThat guardian of gold he should grapple not, urged we,\nbut let him lie where he long had been\nin his earth-hall waiting the end of the world,\nthe hest of heaven. — This hoard is ours\nbut grievously gotten; too grim the fate\nwhich thither carried our king and lord.\nI was within there, and all I viewed,\nthe chambered treasure, when chance allowed me\n(and my path was made in no pleasant wise)\nunder the earth-wall. Eager, I seized\nsuch heap from the hoard as hands could bear\nand hurriedly carried it hither back\nto my liege and lord. Alive was he still,\nstill wielding his wits. The wise old man\nspake much in his sorrow, and sent you greetings\nand bade that ye build, when he breathed no more,\non the place of his balefire a barrow high,\nmemorial mighty. Of men was he\nworthiest warrior wide earth o’er\nthe while he had joy of his jewels and burg.\nLet us set out in haste now, the second time\nto see and search this store of treasure,\nthese wall-hid wonders, — the way I show you, —\nwhere, gathered near, ye may gaze your fill\nat broad-gold and rings. Let the bier, soon made,\nbe all in order when out we come,\nour king and captain to carry thither\n— man beloved — where long he shall bide\nsafe in the shelter of sovran God.”\nThen the bairn of Weohstan bade command,\nhardy chief, to heroes many\nthat owned their homesteads, hither to bring\nfirewood from far — o’er the folk they ruled —\nfor the famed-one’s funeral. “ Fire shall devour\nand wan flames feed on the fearless warrior\nwho oft stood stout in the iron-shower,\nwhen, sped from the string, a storm of arrows\nshot o’er the shield-wall: the shaft held firm,\nfeatly feathered, followed the barb.”\nAnd now the sage young son of Weohstan\nseven chose of the chieftain’s thanes,\nthe best he found that band within,\nand went with these warriors, one of eight,\nunder hostile roof. In hand one bore\na lighted torch and led the way.\nNo lots they cast for keeping the hoard\nwhen once the warriors saw it in hall,\naltogether without a guardian,\nlying there lost. And little they mourned\nwhen they had hastily haled it out,\ndear-bought treasure! The dragon they cast,\nthe worm, o’er the wall for the wave to take,\nand surges swallowed that shepherd of gems.\nThen the woven gold on a wain was laden —\ncountless quite! — and the king was borne,\nhoary hero, to Hrones-Ness.\nTHEN fashioned for him the folk of Geats\nfirm on the earth a funeral-pile,\nand hung it with helmets and harness of war\nand breastplates bright, as the boon he asked;\nand they laid amid it the mighty chieftain,\nheroes mourning their master dear.\nThen on the hill that hugest of balefires\nthe warriors wakened. Wood-smoke rose\nblack over blaze, and blent was the roar\nof flame with weeping (the wind was still),\ntill the fire had broken the frame of bones,\nhot at the heart. In heavy mood\ntheir misery moaned they, their master’s death.\nWailing her woe, the widow   old,\nher hair upbound, for Beowulf’s death\nsung in her sorrow, and said full oft\nshe dreaded the doleful days to come,\ndeaths enow, and doom of battle,\nand shame. — The smoke by the sky was devoured.\nThe folk of the Weders fashioned there\non the headland a barrow broad and high,\nby ocean-farers far descried:\nin ten days’ time their toil had raised it,\nthe battle-brave’s beacon. Round brands of the pyre\na wall they built, the worthiest ever\nthat wit could prompt in their wisest men.\nThey placed in the barrow that precious booty,\nthe rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile,\nhardy heroes, from hoard in cave, —\ntrusting the ground with treasure of earls,\ngold in the earth, where ever it lies\nuseless to men as of yore it was.\nThen about that barrow the battle-keen rode,\natheling-born, a band of twelve,\nlament to make, to mourn their king,\nchant their dirge, and their chieftain honor.\nThey praised his earlship, his acts of prowess\nworthily witnessed: and well it is\nthat men their master-friend mightily laud,\nheartily love, when hence he goes\nfrom life in the body forlorn away.\nThus made their mourning the men of Geatland,\nfor their hero’s passing his hearth-companions:\nquoth that of all the kings of earth,\nof men he was mildest and most beloved,\nto his kin the kindest, keenest for praise.\n', '\nHere bounds the gaudy, gilded chair, \n Bedecked with fringe and tassels gay; \nThe melancholy mourner there \n Pursues her sad and painful way.\nHere, guarded by a motley train,\n The pampered Countess glares along;\nThere, wrung by poverty and pain, \n Pale Misery mingles with the throng.\nHere, as the blazoned chariot rolls,\n And prancing horses scare the crowd,\nGreat names, adorning little souls,\n Announce the empty, vain and proud.\nHere four tall lackeys slow precede\n A painted dame in rich array; \nThere, the sad, shivering child of need\n Steals barefoot o’er the flinty way.\n‘Room, room! stand back!’ they loudly cry,\n The wretched poor are driven around;\nOn every side they scattered fly, \n And shrink before the threatening sound.\nHere, amidst jewels, feathers, flowers, \n The senseless Duchess sits demure,\nHeedless of all the anxious hours\n The sons of modest worth endure.\nAll silvered and embroidered o’er, \n She neither knows nor pities pain; \nThe beggar freezing at her door \n She overlooks with nice disdain.\nThe wretch whom poverty subdues\n Scarce dares to raise his tearful eye;\nOr if by chance the throng he views,\n His loudest murmur is a sigh!\nThe poor wan mother, at whose breast\n The pining infant craves relief, \nIn one thin tattered garment dressed,\n Creeps forth to pour the plaint of grief.\nBut ah! how little heeded here \n The faltering tongue reveals its woe;\nFor high-born fools, with frown austere, \n Condemn the pangs they never know.\n‘Take physic, Pomp!’ let Reason say:\n ‘What can avail thy trappings rare? \nThe tomb shall close thy glittering day,\n The beggar prove thy equal there!’\n', '\nNow, when he and I meet, after all these years,\nI say to the bitch inside me, don’t start growling.\nHe isn’t a trespasser anymore,\nJust an old acquaintance tipping his hat.\nMy voice says, “Nice to see you,”\nAs the bitch starts to bark hysterically.\nHe isn’t an enemy now,\nWhere are your manners, I say, as I say,\n“How are the children? They must be growing up.”\nAt a kind word from him, a look like the old days,\nThe bitch changes her tone; she begins to whimper.\nShe wants to snuggle up to him, to cringe.\nDown, girl! Keep your distance\nOr I’ll give you a taste of the choke-chain.\n“Fine, I’m just fine,” I tell him.\nShe slobbers and grovels.\nAfter all, I am her mistress. She is basically loyal.\nIt’s just that she remembers how she came running\nEach evening, when she heard his step;\nHow she lay at his feet and looked up adoringly\nThough he was absorbed in his paper;\nOr, bored with her devotion, ordered her to the kitchen\nUntil he was ready to play.\nBut the small careless kindnesses\nWhen he’d had a good day, or a couple of drinks,\nCome back to her now, seem more important\nThan the casual cruelties, the ultimate dismissal.\n“It’s nice to know you are doing so well,” I say.\nHe couldn’t have taken you with him;\nYou were too demonstrative, too clumsy,\nNot like the well-groomed pets of his new friends.\n“Give my regards to your wife,” I say. You gag\nAs I drag you off by the scruff,\nSaying, “Goodbye! Goodbye! Nice to have seen you again.”\n', '\n\n\n\nTHEL\'S MOTTO Does the Eagle know what is in the pit? Or wilt thou go ask the Mole: Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod? Or Love in a golden bowl?\n\n\n\nI The daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny flocks.All but the youngest; she in paleness sought the secret air. To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day: Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard: And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew.  O life of this our spring! why fades the lotus of the water? Why fade these children of the spring? born but to smile & fall. Ah! Thel is like a watry bow. and like a parting cloud. Like a reflection in a glass. like shadows in the water. Like dreams of infants. like a smile upon an infants face, Like the doves voice, like transient day, like music in the air; Ah! gentle may I lay me down, and gentle rest my head, And gentle sleep the sleep of death. and gentle hear the voice Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time. The Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass Answer\'d the lovely maid and said: I am a watry weed, And I am very small, and love to dwell in lowly vales; So weak, the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head. Yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all. Walks in the valley. and each morn over me spreads his hand Saying, rejoice thou humble grass, thou new-born lilly flower, Thou gentle maid of silent valleys. and of modest brooks; For thou shalt be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna: Till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs To flourish in eternal vales: then why should Thel complain,  Why should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh.  She ceasd & smild in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.  Thel answered. O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley. Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o\'ertired. Thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells thy milky garments, He crops thy flowers. while thou sittest smiling in his face, Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints. Thy wine doth purify the golden honey, thy perfume, Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs, Revives the milked cow, & tames the fire-breathing steed. But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun: I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place?"  "Queen of the vales," the Lily answered, "ask the tender cloud, And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky, And why it scatters its bright beauty thro\' the humid air. Descend, O little cloud, & hover before the eyes of Thel."  The Cloud descended, and the Lily bowd her modest head, And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass.  II "O little Cloud," the virgin said, "I charge thee tell to me, Why thou complainest not when in one hour thou fade away: Then we shall seek thee but not find; ah, Thel is like to Thee. I pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my voice."  The Cloud then shew\'d his golden head & his bright form emerg\'d, Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel.  "O virgin, know\'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs Where Luvah doth renew his horses? Look\'st thou on my youth, And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more, Nothing remains? O maid, I tell thee, when I pass away, It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy: Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers, And court the fair eyed dew, to take me to her shining tent: The weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun, Till we arise link\'d in a golden band, and never part, But walk united, bearing food to all our tender flowers."  "Dost thou O little Cloud? I fear that I am not like thee; For I walk through the vales of Har and smell the sweetest flowers, But I feed not the little flowers; I hear the warbling birds, But I feed not the warbling birds; they fly and seek their food; But Thel delights in these no more, because I fade away, And all shall say, \'Without a use this shining woman liv\'d, Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms?\'"  The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answer\'d thus:  "Then if thou art the food of worms, O virgin of the skies, How great thy use, how great thy blessing! Every thing that lives Lives not alone, nor for itself; fear not, and I will call The weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice. Come forth, worm of the silent valley, to thy pensive queen."  The helpless worm arose, and sat upon the Lily\'s leaf, And the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale.  III Then Thel astonish\'d view\'d the Worm upon its dewy bed.  "Art thou a Worm? Image of weakness, art thou but a Worm? I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lily\'s leaf; Ah, weep not, little voice, thou can\'st not speak, but thou can\'st weep. Is this a Worm? I see thee lay helpless & naked, weeping, And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mother\'s smiles."  The Clod of Clay heard the Worm\'s voice, & raisd her pitying head; She bow\'d over the weeping infant, and her life exhal\'d In milky fondness; then on Thel she fix\'d her humble eyes.  "O beauty of the vales of Har! we live not for ourselves; Thou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed; My bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark,  But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head, And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast, And says: \'Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee And I have given thee a crown that none can take away.\' But how this is, sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know; I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love."  The daughter of beauty wip\'d her pitying tears with her white veil, And said: "Alas! I knew not this, and therefore did I weep. That God would love a Worm, I knew, and punish the evil foot That, wilful, bruis\'d its helpless form; but that he cherish\'d it With milk and oil I never knew; and therefore did I weep, And I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away, And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot."  "Queen of the vales," the matron Clay answered, "I heard thy sighs, And all thy moans flew o\'er my roof, but I have call\'d them down. Wilt thou, O Queen, enter my house? \'tis given thee to enter And to return: fear nothing, enter with thy virgin feet."  IV The eternal gates\' terrific porter lifted the northern bar: Thel enter\'d in & saw the secrets of the land unknown. She saw the couches of the dead, & where the fibrous roots Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists: A land of sorrows & of tears where never smile was seen.  She wanderd in the land of clouds thro\' valleys dark, listning Dolours & lamentations; waiting oft beside a dewy grave, She stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground, Till to her own grave plot she came, & there she sat down, And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit:  "Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction? Or the glistning Eye to the poison of a smile? Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn, Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie? Or an Eye of gifts & graces, show\'ring fruits and coined gold? Why a Tongue impress\'d with honey from every wind? Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in? Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror, trembling, and affright? Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy? Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?"  The Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har.\n', '\nBorn like the pines to sing,\n   The harp and song in m’ breast,\nThough far and near,\nThere’s none to hear,\nI’ll sing as th’ winds request. \nTo tell the trend of m’ lay,\n   Is not for th’ harp or me;\nI’m only to know,\nFrom the winds that blow,\nWhat th’ theme of m’ song shall be. \nBorn like the pines to sing,\n   The harp and th’ song in m’ breast,\nAs th’ winds sweep by,\nI’ll laugh or cry,\nIn th’ winds I cannot rest.\n \n', '\nA dinner party, coffee, tea,\nSandwich, or supper, all may be\nIn their way pleasant. But to me\nNot one of these deserves the praise\nThat welcomer of new-born days, A breakfast, merits; ever giving\nCheerful notice we are living\nAnother day refreshed by sleep,\nWhen its festival we keep.\nNow although I would not slight\nThose kindly words we use ‘Good night’,\nYet parting words are words of sorrow,\nAnd may not vie with sweet ‘Good Morrow’,\nWith which again our friends we greet,\nWhen in the breakfast-room we meet,\nAt the social table round,\nListening to the lively sound\nOf those notes which never tire,\nOf urn, or kettle on the fire.\nSleepy Robert never hears\nOr urn, or kettle; he appears\nWhen all have finished, one by one\nDropping off, and breakfast done.\nYet has he too his own pleasure,\nHis breakfast hour’s his hour of leisure;\nAnd, left alone, he reads or muses,\nOr else in idle mood he uses\nTo sit and watch the venturous fly,\nWhere the sugar’s piled high,\nClambering o’er the lumps so white,\nRocky cliffs of sweet delight.\n', '\n\n\n\nThe bridge barely curved that connects the terrible with the tender.\n—Rilke\n\n\n\n1\n\nThe children play at the Luxembourg fountain.\nTheir small ships catch wind and sail out and come round again.\n\n\n2\n\nSometime between 250 and 200 B.C.\nfishermen and boatmen of the tribe Parisii\ndiscovered and built their huts on the largest island   \nin the River Seine. Celtic Lutetia, “Town surround-\ned by water,”\n                     thus was born there.\nThe island is shaped like a boat—\nand this figure became a part\nof the capital’s coat-of-arms. So this was the start   \nof the City first named for its engulfing water   \n(on whose economy it depended), then after\nthe people themselves: members of the tribe of Paris.   \nWe listen to these water folk and know they hear us,   \nfor we are born out of boats and out of water.   \nThe first sound we hear is the heart\nknocking quiet as a boat docks:\nand we all dissolve to island, earth and tears later.\n\n\n3\n\nAnd into air and fire! Once in the Latin Quarter\nin a space formed for him by waves of bright loiterers\nnear the shortest street named for the Cat Who Catches Fish—\nor who (with slight inflection) “sins”—\nI watched a dark young man, naked to his thin waist, push\nlong plumes of flame into the air\nabove our awed faces raised there.\nFrom the sharp heat inside and out,\nhis head and chest glowed in the night\nwith an aura of oil or sweat.\nThirsting, he drank again from a sponge of kerosene\nand breathed out long strings of fire and smoke into the Street   \nof the Harp.\n                   Dark ash dropped back upon his face and cap,   \nwhich lay open on the cobbled road waiting for coins   \nfrom all who guessed at the mystery in what he’d done.   \nHe built a vast pillar of fire as if to guide us,\nthen suddenly stopped, walked across\nthe space, and kissed a reaching child\n(to bless and heal that amazed head),\nwaved gratefully to us who now filled his cap with alms,\nand, smiling and burned (I saw scars beneath his raised arm),   \nhe sailed up that narrowing street in a wildly bal-\nlooning white shirt we had watched him casually don   \nto cover his vestment of skin.\n\n\n4\n\nFor centuries that old City\nended its west boundary\nin a small archipelago\nseparated from the main island by the Seine’s two\narms. It was on one of these small islets that Philip\nthe Fair about the year 1314 had raised up\na stake for the grand master, Order of Templars, whom\nhe condemned, then from the palace window watched him burn.   \nThese little islands, quickened with their ghost victim’s screams,   \nwere joined in the sixteenth century by the decree\nof Henry Third (and by a great engineering feat\nFaust could envy) to the main island of the City.\nThis new western tip was given the name of a park,\n“Vert Galant,” nickname of Henry Fourth: “The Gay old Spark.”\nNear there I watched in a loud street\na white-haired man stand with one foot\non the curb, the other in the cobbled street, and play   \nan old mandolin. He was dressed in a black and frayed   \ntuxedo and played with intense passion, sadly, but   \nthis desperate, dignified man, transformed by his art   \nand by poverty (his case kept open for money),\ncould not play the mandolin. —He\njust strummed the same chord again\n                                                    and again and again ...\n\n\n5\n\nIt was also Philip the Fair\nwho created an aristocratic prison air\nby building the blocks-long Gothic Conciergerie.\nThe best view is from the Right Bank: The Slaughter House Quay   \n(which now is a market for pets).\nYou can see the four recently cleaned towers reflect-\ned in the Seine. (At the Seine in fall, beneath the red   \nand gold leaves, you see the rust, mahogany and beige   \nboats gently jostle together at the shore and wait.)   \nOn the right: the crenelated Bonbec Tower stays.   \nBonbec means “babbler,” for this place\nwas used through the centuries as a torture chamber.   \nThe right one of the twin towers, Argent, held treasure.   \nStill the gorgeous Horloge Tower on the left corner\nof the ancient building across from the Bridge of Change   \nhouses the giant clock which gave its name to that quay:   \nin its field of blue the many great gold fleurs-de-lys   \nand the two life-sized mythical\nwomen, one with a fascicle\nof wheat, one with a balanced scale raised high in the clock,   \nwhose silver chime used to toll the hours for the monarch.   \n(This was melted down in those days when Terror struck.)   \nIn this turreted place we have shaved the graceful neck   \nand head of Marie Antoinette, ripped her white, ruffled   \ncollar wide and wrapped the cuff of\nrope about her hands behind her back. We made her face\nthe casual knitting women and men making fists   \nsitting on steps in the “May Court”\n(where a fresh tree was placed each spring by the lawyers’ clerks!)   \non her way to the guillotine. Its blade was heavy   \nas primeval stone: she, the chemist Lavoisier,   \nCharlotte Corday, poet and brother André Chénier,   \nMadame du Barry—all 2600 who died,\nhaving said their last farewells in the Women‘s Courtyard,   \ntwelve per day underneath the blade!\nand some were disemboweled beside.\nWas there sometimes an image of beauty in their minds   \nat the last? Perhaps on white sands\nbeside the blue-black sea a matched pair of roan horses   \ngalloping together in the bright spume, riderless.   \nOr a nude young man and woman lying together   \ntouching in a field of flowers?\n\n\n6\n\nNearby on this Island the gargoyles of Notre Dame\ngawk in ancient horror and some\nforever gnaw on stone rabbits in the parapets\nor wail in winged, formal misery outside the set\nlimits of the orthodox Church—\nall glory happening within the walls where they squat:\nso hunched, so beaked, so horrorstruck.\n\n\n7\n\nA wing of the May Courtyard where the condemned waited   \n“Monsieur de Paris” as executioners were named   \nnow adjoins the building of glass and light, with no walls,   \nit seems, jewel of Sainte Chapelle,\nits windows of rose and blue, gold, green, yellow, purple,   \nrising fifty feet:\n                            its spire piercing the foliate,\nlayered, many-colored egg of the vault of heaven,   \nshowering all the primal hues and shadows given—\nbright as the truth reflected in a drop of fresh blood   \nor the colors of the body’s inner organs hid-\nden before the sure explosion of light that hits them   \nat the moment of violent death. —This is a time\nlike that of the sun that once a year, just at the dawn   \nof winter solstice, lights up an ancient Celtic stone   \ngrave, striking the bones spread on shelves\nwith all the colors of the flesh.\n\n\n8\n\nWho can stand these juxtapositions of person and place and time? I walk across the Bridge of Change where I have so often watched by the towers of the Conciergerie. Now, water laves a little higher up the stair from the River to the Quay, hiding some of the steps from me. Boats nudge at the edge. I walk along the Boulevard past the great gold and blue corner clock, the ornate wrought-iron gate and fence of the Place of Justice (its name changed from the time of kings), past the shadow and spire of Sainte Chapelle. I cross the Bridge of Saint Michel into the Latin Quarter. But I do not look for the Street of the Cat Who Fishes or the Street of the Harp. I turn right, wandering a bit, and suddenly, as if by chance, find myself at this street, and here I will wait, for it is our street, Rue Gît le Coeur: Here Lies the Heart.\n\n               for Roger Aplon—1975\n', '\n\n\n\n(being a conversation in eight poems between an aged Lucifer and God, though only Lucifer is heard.

Whatever’s here\nis just here, and nowhere else,\nso it’s right to end up beside\nthe woman who bore me, to shovel\ninto the dirt whatever’s left\nand leave only a name for some-\none who wants it. Think of it,\nmy name, no longer a portion\nof me, no longer inflated\nor bruised, no longer stewing\nin a rich compost of memory\nor the simpler one of bone shards,\ndirt, kitty litter, wood ashes,\nthe roots of the eucalyptus\nI planted in ’73,\na tiny me taking nothing,\ngiving nothing, and free at last.\n', '\nHigh at the window in her cage         The old canary flits and sings, Nor sees across the curtain pass    The shadow of a swallow’s wings.

She gathers piteous bits and shreds,    This solitary, mateless thing, To patient build again the nest    So rudely scattered spring by spring;  And sings her brief, unlisted songs,    Her dreams of bird life wild and free, Yet never beats her prison bars    At sound of song from bush or tree.  But in my busiest hours I pause,    Held by a sense of urgent speech, Bewildered by that spark-like soul,    Able my very soul to reach.  She will be heard; she chirps me loud,    When I forget those gravest cares, Her small provision to supply,    Clear water or her seedsman’s wares.  She begs me now for that chief joy    The round great world is made to grow,— Her wisp of greenness. Hear her chide,    Because my answering thought is slow!  What can my life seem like to her?    A dull, unpunctual service mine; Stupid before her eager call,    Her flitting steps, her insight fine.  To open wide thy prison door,    Poor friend, would give thee to thy foes; And yet a plaintive note I hear,    As if to tell how slowly goes  The time of thy long prisoning.    Bird! does some promise keep thee sane? Will there be better days for thee?    Will thy soul too know life again?

Where is tomorrow? In another world. For numbers this is certain; the reverse Is sure to none; and yet on this perhaps, This peradventure, infamous for lies, As on a rock of adamant we build Our mountain hopes; spin out eternal schemes, As we the fatal sisters would outspin, And, big with life\'s futurities, expire.    Not even Philander had bespoke his shroud; Nor had he cause, a warning was denied; How many fall as sudden, not as safe? As sudden, though for years admonished home: Of human ills the last extreme beware, Beware, Lorenzo! a slow-sudden death. How dreadful that deliberate surprise? Be wise today, \'tis madness to defer; Next day the fatal precedent will plead; Thus on, till wisdom is pushed out of life: Procrastination is the thief of time, Year after year it steals, till all are fled, And to the mercies of a moment leaves The vast concerns of an eternal scene. If not so frequent, would not this be strange? That \'tis so frequent, this is stranger still.    Of man\'s miraculous mistakes, this bears The palm, "That all men are about to live," For ever on the brink of being born: All pay themselves the compliment to think They, one day, shall not drivel; and their pride On this reversion takes up ready praise; At least, their own; their future selves applauds; How excellent that life they ne\'er will lead? Time lodged in their own hands is folly\'s vails; That lodged in Fate\'s, to wisdom they consign; The thing they can\'t but purpose, they postpone; \'Tis not in folly, not to scorn a fool; And scarce in human wisdom to do more: All promise is poor dilatory man, And that through every stage: when young, indeed, In full content, we sometimes nobly rest, Unanxious for ourselves; and only wish, As duteous sons, our fathers were more wise: At thirty man suspects himself a fool; Knows it at forty, and reforms his plan; At fifty chides his infamous delay, Pushes his prudent purpose to resolve; In all the magnanimity of thought Resolves, and re-resolves:then dies the same. \n', '\n\n\n\n(to JK)\n\n\n\nThose scars rooted me.

But where did the sadness go? People wanted to know. They didn’t want it collecting in their elbows or knees then popping up later. The girl who thought of the ponies made a lot of money. Now a month’s supply of pills came in a hard blue case with a handle. You opened it & found the usual vial plus six tiny ponies of assorted shapes & sizes, softly breathing in the Styrofoam. Often they had to be pried out & would wobble a little when first put on the ground. In the beginning the children tried to play with them, but the sharp hooves nicked their fingers & the ponies refused to jump over pencil hurdles. The children stopped feeding them sugarwater & the ponies were left to break their legs on the gardens’ gravel paths or drown in the gutters. On the first day of the month, rats gathered on doorsteps & spat out only the bitter manes. Many a pony’s last sight was a bounding squirrel with its tail hovering over its head like a halo. Behind the movie theatre the hardier ponies gathered in packs amongst the cigarette butts, getting their hooves stuck in wads of gum. They lined the hills at funerals, huddled under folding chairs at weddings. It became a matter of pride if one of your ponies proved unusually sturdy. People would smile & say, “This would have been an awful month for me,” pointing to the glossy palomino trotting energetically around their ankles. Eventually, the ponies were no longer needed.

O the days gone by! The apples in the orchard, and the pathway through the rye; The chirrup of the robin, and the whistle of the quail As he piped across the meadows sweet as any nightingale; When the bloom was on the clover, and the blue was in the sky, And my happy heart brimmed over in the days gone by.  In the days gone by, when my naked feet were tripped By the honey-suckle’s tangles where the water-lilies dipped, And the ripples of the river lipped the moss along the brink Where the placid-eyed and lazy-footed cattle came to drink, And the tilting snipe stood fearless of the truant’s wayward cry And the splashing of the swimmer, in the days gone by.  O the days gone by! O the days gone by! The music of the laughing lip, the luster of the eye; The childish faith in fairies, and Aladdin’s magic ring— The simple, soul-reposing, glad belief in everything,— When life was like a story, holding neither sob nor sigh, In the golden olden glory of the days gone by.\n', '\nGoing to sleep, I cross my hands on my chest.   \nThey will place my hands like this.   \nIt will look as though I am flying into myself.\n', '\nWhen the beautiful young man drowned—\naccidentally, swimming at dawn\nin a current too swift for him,\nor obedient to some cult\nof total immersion that promised\nthe bather would come up divine, \nmortality rinsed from him—\nHadrian placed his image everywhere,\na marble Antinoüs staring across\nthe public squares where a few dogs\nalways scuffled, planted\nin every squalid little crossroads \nat the furthest corners of the Empire.\nWhat do we want in any body\nbut the world?

With motions strange His listless limbs their wayward postures change; While many a crooked line and curious maze With clouted shoon he on the sand portrays. At length the half-chewed straw fell from his mouth, And to himself low spoke the moody youth.     ‘How simple is the lad and reft of skill, Who thinks with love to fix a woman’s will: Who every Sunday morn, to please her sight, Knots up his neckcloth gay and hosen white; Who for her pleasure keeps his pockets bare, And half his wages spends on pedlar’s ware; When every niggard clown or dotard old, Who hides in secret nooks his oft-told gold, Whose field or orchard tempts, with all her pride, At little cost may win her for his bride! While all the meed her silly lover gains, Is but the neighbours’ jeering for his pains. On Sunday last, when Susan’s banns were read, And I astonished sat with hanging head, Cold grew my shrinking frame, and loose my knee, While every neighbour’s eye was fixed on me. Ah Sue! when last we worked at Hodge’s hay, And still at me you mocked in wanton play — When last at fair, well pleased by chapman’s stand, You took the new-bought fairing from my hand — When at old Hobb’s you sung that song so gay, ‘Sweet William,’ still the burthen of the lay, — I little thought, alas! the lots were cast, That thou shouldst be another’s bride at last; And had, when last we tripped it on the green, And laughed at stiff-backed Rob, small thought I ween, Ere yet another scanty month was flown To see thee wedded to the hateful clown. Ay, lucky churl! more gold thy pockets line, But did these shapely limbs resemble thine, I’d stay at home and tend the household gear, Nor on the green with other lads appear. Ay, lucky churl! no store thy cottage lacks, And round thy barn thick stand the sheltered stacks. But did such features coarse my visage grace, I’d never budge the bonnet from my face. Yet let it be; it shall not break my ease, He best deserves who doth the maiden please. Such silly cause no more shall give me pain, Nor ever maiden cross my rest again. Such grizzled suitors with their taste agree, And the black fiend may take them all for me!’  Now through the village rose confused sounds, Hoarse lads, and children shrill, and yelping hounds. Straight every housewife at her door is seen, And pausing hedgers on their mattocks lean. At every narrow lane and alley’s mouth Loud-laughing lasses stand, and joking youth. A bridal band tricked out in colours gay, With minstrels blithe before to cheer the way, From clouds of curling dust that onward fly, In rural splendour break upon the eye. As in their way they hold so gaily on, Caps, beads, and buttons, glancing in the sun, Each village wag with eye of roguish cast, Some maiden jogs and vents the ready jest; While village toasts the passing belles deride, And sober matrons marvel at their pride. But William, head erect, with settled brow, In sullen silence viewed the passing show; And oft he scratched his pate with careless grace, And scorned to pull the bonnet o’er his face; But did with steady look unaltered wait, Till hindmost man had passed the churchyard gate, Then turned him to his cot with visage flat, Where honest Lightfoot on the threshold sat. Up leaped the kindly beast his hand to lick, And for his pains received an angry kick. Loud shuts the door with harsh and thundering din; The echoes round their circling course begin, From cot to cot, church tower, and rocky dell, It grows amain with wide progressive swell, And Lightfoot joins the coil with long and piteous yell.\n', '\n6:48 a.m., and leaden\n    little jokes about what heroes\n   we are for getting up at this hour.\nQuiet.

How by the desultory breeze caressed, Like some coy maid half yielding to her lover, It pours such sweet upbraiding, as must needs Tempt to repeat the wrong! And now, its strings Boldlier swept, the long sequacious notes Over delicious surges sink and rise, Such a soft floating witchery of sound As twilight Elfins make, when they at eve Voyage on gentle gales from Fairy-Land, Where Melodies round honey-dropping flowers, Footless and wild, like birds of Paradise, Nor pause, nor perch, hovering on untamed wing! O! the one Life within us and abroad, Which meets all motion and becomes its soul, A light in sound, a sound-like power in light, Rhythm in all thought, and joyance everywhere— Methinks, it should have been impossible Not to love all things in a world so filled; Where the breeze warbles, and the mute still air Is Music slumbering on her instrument.      And thus, my Love! as on the midway slope Of yonder hill I stretch my limbs at noon, Whilst through my half-closed eyelids I behold The sunbeams dance, like diamonds, on the main, And tranquil muse upon tranquility: Full many a thought uncalled and undetained, And many idle flitting phantasies, Traverse my indolent and passive brain, As wild and various as the random gales That swell and flutter on this subject Lute!      And what if all of animated nature Be but organic Harps diversely framed, That tremble into thought, as o’er them sweeps Plastic and vast, one intellectual breeze, At once the Soul of each, and God of all?      But thy more serious eye a mild reproof Darts, O beloved Woman! nor such thoughts Dim and unhallowed dost thou not reject, And biddest me walk humbly with my God. Meek Daughter in the family of Christ! Well hast thou said and holily dispraised These shapings of the unregenerate mind; Bubbles that glitter as they rise and break On vain Philosophy’s aye-babbling spring. For never guiltless may I speak of him, The Incomprehensible! save when with awe I praise him, and with Faith that inly feels; Who with his saving mercies healèd me, A sinful and most miserable man, Wildered and dark, and gave me to possess Peace, and this Cot, and thee, heart-honored Maid!  \n', '\nStop, Christian passer-by!—Stop, child of God,\nAnd read with gentle breast.

And while at a tavern my gentleman tarries, The coachman grows richer than he whom he carries; And I’d rather (said I), since it saves me from sin, Be the driver without, than the toper within.  Yet though dram-shops I hate, and the dram-drinking friend, I’m not quite so good but I wish I may mend; I repent of my sins, since we all are depraved, For a coachman, I hold, has a soul to be saved.  When a riotous multitude fills up a street, And the greater part know not, boys, wherefore they meet; If I see there is mischief, I never go there, Let others get tipsy so I get my fare.  Now to church, if I take some good lady to pray, It grieves me full sore to be kept quite away; So I step within side, though the sermon’s begun, For a slice of the service is better than none.  Then my glasses are whole, and my coach is so neat, I am always the first to be called in the street; And I’m known by the name (’tis a name rather rare) Of the coachman that never asks more than his fare.  Though my beasts should be dull, yet I don’t use them ill; Though they stumble I swear not, nor cut them up hill; For I firmly believe there’s no charm in an oath That can make a nag trot, when to walk he is loath.  And though I’m a coachman, I’ll freely confess, I beg of my Maker my labours to bless; I praise Him each morning, and pray every night, And ’tis this makes my heart feel so cheerful and light.  When I drive to a funeral I care not for drink; That is not the moment to guzzle, but think; And I wish I could add both of coachman and master, That both of us strove to amend a bit faster.\n', '\n1 Eastern guard tower glints in sunset; convicts rest like lizards on rocks.  2 The piano man is stingy, at 3 A.M. his songs drop like plum.  3 Morning sun slants cell.

Two of them, patinaed that sea-glass green of copper weather vanes nosing the wind, the sun-lit green of rockweed, the lichen’s green scabbing-over of the bouldered shore, the plush green peat that carpets the island, that hushes, sinks then holds a boot print for days, and the sapling-green of new pines sprouting through it. The miraculous green origami of their wings—false eyed, doomed and sensual as the mermaid’s long green fins: a green siren calling from the moonlight.  A green siren calling from the moonlight, from the sweet gum leaves and paper birches that shed, like tiny white decrees, scrolled bark. They emerge from cocoons like greased hinges, all pheromone and wing, instinct and flutter. They rise, hardwired, driven, through the creaking pine branches tufted with beard moss and fog. Two luna moths flitting like exotic birds towards only each other and light, in these their final few days, they mate, then starving they wait, inches apart, on my cabin wall to die, to share fully each pure and burning moment. They are, like desire itself, born without mouths. What, if not this, is love?\n', '\n\n\n\nA Sestina\n\n\n\nWe are the smiling comfortable homes With happy families enthroned therein, Where baby souls are brought to meet the world, Where women end their duties and desires, For which men labor as the goal of life, That people worship now instead of God.  Do we not teach the child to worship God? — Whose soul’s young range is bounded by the homes Of those he loves, and where he learns that life Is all constrained to serve the wants therein, Domestic needs and personal desires, — These are the early limits of his world.  And are we not the woman’s perfect world, Prescribed by nature and ordained of God, Beyond which she can have no right desires, No need for service other than in homes? For doth she not bring up her young therein? And is not rearing young the end of life?  And man? What other need hath he in life Than to go forth and labor in the world, And struggle sore with other men therein? Not to serve other men, nor yet his God, But to maintain these comfortable homes, – The end of all a normal man’s desires.  Shall not the soul’s most measureless desires Learn that the very flower and fruit of life Lies all attained in comfortable homes, With which life’s purpose is to dot the world And consummate the utmost will of God, By sitting down to eat and drink therein.  Yea, in the processes that work therein —   Fulfilment of our natural desires —   Surely man finds the proof that mighty God For to maintain and reproduce his life Created him and set him in the world; And this high end is best attained in homes.  Are we not homes? And is not all therein? Wring dry the world to meet our wide desires! We crown all life! We are the aim of God!\n', '\nI will build a house of rest, Square the corners every one: At each angle on his breast Shall a cherub take the sun; Rising, risen, sinking, down, Weaving day’s unequal crown.  In the chambers, light as air, Shall responsive footsteps fall: Brother, sister, art thou there? Hush! we need not jar nor call; Need not turn to seek the face Shut in rapture’s hiding-place.  Heavy load and mocking care Shall from back and bosom part; Thought shall reach the thrill of prayer, Patience plan the dome of art. None shall praise or merit claim, Not a joy be called by name.  With a free, unmeasured tread Shall we pace the cloisters through: Rest, enfranchised, like the Dead; Rest till Love be born anew. Weary Thought shall take his time, Free of task-work, loosed from rhyme.  No reproof shall grieve or chill; Every sin doth stand confest; None need murmur, ‘This was ill’: Therefore do they grant us rest; Contemplation making whole Every ruin of the soul.  Pictures shall as softly look As in distance shows delight; Slowly shall each saintly book Turn its pages in our sight; Not the study’s wealth confuse, Urging zeal to pale abuse.  Children through the windows peep, Not reproachful, though our own; Hushed the parent passion deep, And the household’s eager tone. One above, divine and true, Makes us children like to you.  Measured bread shall build us up At the hospitable board; In Contentment’s golden cup Is the guileless liquor poured. May the beggar pledge the king In that spirit gathering,  Oh! my house is far away; Yet it sometimes shuts me in. Imperfection mars each day While the perfect works begin.

I have said it twice:\n   That alone should encourage the crew.\nJust the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:\n   What I tell you three times is true." \nThe crew was complete: it included a Boots—\n   A maker of Bonnets and Hoods—\nA Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes—\n   And a Broker, to value their goods. \nA Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,\n   Might perhaps have won more than his share—\nBut a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,\n   Had the whole of their cash in his care. \nThere was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,\n   Or would sit making lace in the bow:\nAnd had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,\n   Though none of the sailors knew how. \nThere was one who was famed for the number of things\n   He forgot when he entered the ship:\nHis umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,\n   And the clothes he had bought for the trip. \nHe had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,\n   With his name painted clearly on each:\nBut, since he omitted to mention the fact,\n   They were all left behind on the beach. \nThe loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because\n   He had seven coats on when he came,\nWith three pair of boots—but the worst of it was,\n   He had wholly forgotten his name. \nHe would answer to "Hi!" or to any loud cry,\n   Such as "Fry me!" or "Fritter my wig!"\nTo "What-you-may-call-um!" or "What-was-his-name!"\n   But especially "Thing-um-a-jig!" \nWhile, for those who preferred a more forcible word,\n   He had different names from these:\nHis intimate friends called him "Candle-ends,"\n   And his enemies "Toasted-cheese." \n"His form is ungainly—his intellect small—"\n   (So the Bellman would often remark)\n"But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,\n   Is the thing that one needs with a Snark." \nHe would joke with hænas, returning their stare\n   With an impudent wag of the head:\nAnd he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,\n   "Just to keep up its spirits," he said. \nHe came as a Baker: but owned, when too late—\n   And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad—\nHe could only bake Bride-cake—for which, I may state,\n   No materials were to be had. \nThe last of the crew needs especial remark,\n   Though he looked an incredible dunce:\nHe had just one idea—but, that one being "Snark,"\n   The good Bellman engaged him at once. \nHe came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,\n   When the ship had been sailing a week,\nHe could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,\n   And was almost too frightened to speak: \nBut at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,\n   There was only one Beaver on board;\nAnd that was a tame one he had of his own,\n   Whose death would be deeply deplored. \nThe Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,\n   Protested, with tears in its eyes,\nThat not even the rapture of hunting the Snark\n   Could atone for that dismal surprise! \nIt strongly advised that the Butcher should be\n   Conveyed in a separate ship:\nBut the Bellman declared that would never agree\n   With the plans he had made for the trip: \nNavigation was always a difficult art,\n   Though with only one ship and one bell:\nAnd he feared he must really decline, for his part,\n   Undertaking another as well. \nThe Beaver\'s best course was, no doubt, to procure\n   A second-hand dagger-proof coat—\nSo the Baker advised it—and next, to insure\n   Its life in some Office of note: \nThis the Banker suggested, and offered for hire\n   (On moderate terms), or for sale,\nTwo excellent Policies, one Against Fire,\n   And one Against Damage From Hail. \nYet still, ever after that sorrowful day,\n   Whenever the Butcher was by,\nThe Beaver kept looking the opposite way,\n   And appeared unaccountably shy. \n                  Fit the Second\n                      The Bellman\'s Speech \nThe Bellman himself they all praised to the skies—\n   Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!\nSuch solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,\n   The moment one looked in his face! \nHe had bought a large map representing the sea,\n   Without the least vestige of land:\nAnd the crew were much pleased when they found it to be\n   A map they could all understand. \n"What\'s the good of Mercator\'s North Poles and Equators,\n   Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?"\nSo the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply\n   "They are merely conventional signs! \n"Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!\n   But we\'ve got our brave Captain to thank\n(So the crew would protest) "that he\'s bought us the best—\n   A perfect and absolute blank!" \nThis was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out\n   That the Captain they trusted so well\nHad only one notion for crossing the ocean,\n   And that was to tingle his bell. \nHe was thoughtful and grave—but the orders he gave\n   Were enough to bewilder a crew.\nWhen he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!"\n   What on earth was the helmsman to do? \nThen the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:\n   A thing, as the Bellman remarked,\nThat frequently happens in tropical climes,\n   When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked." \nBut the principal failing occurred in the sailing,\n   And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,\nSaid he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,\n   That the ship would not travel due West! \nBut the danger was past—they had landed at last,\n   With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:\nYet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,\n   Which consisted to chasms and crags. \nThe Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,\n   And repeated in musical tone\nSome jokes he had kept for a season of woe—\n   But the crew would do nothing but groan. \nHe served out some grog with a liberal hand,\n   And bade them sit down on the beach:\nAnd they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,\n   As he stood and delivered his speech. \n"Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!"\n   (They were all of them fond of quotations:\nSo they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,\n   While he served out additional rations). \n"We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,\n   (Four weeks to the month you may mark),\nBut never as yet (\'tis your Captain who speaks)\n   Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark! \n"We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,\n   (Seven days to the week I allow),\nBut a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,\n   We have never beheld till now! \n"Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again\n   The five unmistakable marks\nBy which you may know, wheresoever you go,\n   The warranted genuine Snarks. \n"Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,\n   Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:\nLike a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,\n   With a flavour of Will-o\'-the-wisp. \n"Its habit of getting up late you\'ll agree\n   That it carries too far, when I say\nThat it frequently breakfasts at five-o\'clock tea,\n   And dines on the following day. \n"The third is its slowness in taking a jest.\n   Should you happen to venture on one,\nIt will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:\n   And it always looks grave at a pun. \n"The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,\n   Which it constantly carries about,\nAnd believes that they add to the beauty of scenes—\n   A sentiment open to doubt. \n"The fifth is ambition. It next will be right\n   To describe each particular batch:\nDistinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,\n   From those that have whiskers, and scratch. \n"For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,\n   Yet, I feel it my duty to say,\nSome are Boojums—" The Bellman broke off in alarm,\n   For the Baker had fainted away. \n            Fit the Third\n               The Baker\'s Tale \nThey roused him with muffins—they roused him with ice—\n   They roused him with mustard and cress—\nThey roused him with jam and judicious advice—\n   They set him conundrums to guess. \nWhen at length he sat up and was able to speak,\n   His sad story he offered to tell;\nAnd the Bellman cried "Silence! Not even a shriek!"\n   And excitedly tingled his bell. \nThere was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,\n   Scarcely even a howl or a groan,\nAs the man they called "Ho!" told his story of woe\n   In an antediluvian tone. \n"My father and mother were honest, though poor—"\n   "Skip all that!" cried the Bellman in haste.\n"If it once becomes dark, there\'s no chance of a Snark—\n   We have hardly a minute to waste!" \n"I skip forty years," said the Baker, in tears,\n   "And proceed without further remark\nTo the day when you took me aboard of your ship\n   To help you in hunting the Snark. \n"A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)\n   Remarked, when I bade him farewell—"\n"Oh, skip your dear uncle!" the Bellman exclaimed,\n   As he angrily tingled his bell. \n"He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men,\n   "\'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:\nFetch it home by all means—you may serve it with greens,\n   And it\'s handy for striking a light. \n"\'You may seek it with thimbles—and seek it with care;\n   You may hunt it with forks and hope;\nYou may threaten its life with a railway-share;\n   You may charm it with smiles and soap—\'" \n("That\'s exactly the method," the Bellman bold\n   In a hasty parenthesis cried,\n"That\'s exactly the way I have always been told\n   That the capture of Snarks should be tried!") \n"\'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,\n   If your Snark be a Boojum! For then\nYou will softly and suddenly vanish away,\n   And never be met with again!\' \n"It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,\n   When I think of my uncle\'s last words:\nAnd my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl\n   Brimming over with quivering curds! \n"It is this, it is this—" "We have had that before!"\n   The Bellman indignantly said.\nAnd the Baker replied "Let me say it once more.\n   It is this, it is this that I dread! \n"I engage with the Snark—every night after dark—\n   In a dreamy delirious fight:\nI serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,\n   And I use it for striking a light: \n"But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,\n   In a moment (of this I am sure),\nI shall softly and suddenly vanish away—\n   And the notion I cannot endure!" \n            Fit the Fourth\n               The Hunting \nThe Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.\n   "If only you\'d spoken before!\nIt\'s excessively awkward to mention it now,\n   With the Snark, so to speak, at the door! \n"We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,\n   If you never were met with again—\nBut surely, my man, when the voyage began,\n   You might have suggested it then? \n"It\'s excessively awkward to mention it now—\n   As I think I\'ve already remarked."\nAnd the man they called "Hi!" replied, with a sigh,\n   "I informed you the day we embarked. \n"You may charge me with murder—or want of sense—\n   (We are all of us weak at times):\nBut the slightest approach to a false pretence\n   Was never among my crimes! \n"I said it in Hebrew—I said it in Dutch—\n   I said it in German and Greek:\nBut I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)\n   That English is what you speak!" \n"\'Tis a pitiful tale," said the Bellman, whose face\n   Had grown longer at every word:\n"But, now that you\'ve stated the whole of your case,\n   More debate would be simply absurd. \n"The rest of my speech" (he explained to his men)\n   "You shall hear when I\'ve leisure to speak it.\nBut the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!\n   \'Tis your glorious duty to seek it! \n"To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;\n   To pursue it with forks and hope;\nTo threaten its life with a railway-share;\n   To charm it with smiles and soap! \n"For the Snark\'s a peculiar creature, that won\'t\n   Be caught in a commonplace way.\nDo all that you know, and try all that you don\'t:\n   Not a chance must be wasted to-day! \n"For England expects—I forbear to proceed:\n   \'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:\nAnd you\'d best be unpacking the things that you need\n   To rig yourselves out for the fight." \nThen the Banker endorsed a blank check (which he crossed),\n   And changed his loose silver for notes.\nThe Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,\n   And shook the dust out of his coats. \nThe Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade—\n   Each working the grindstone in turn:\nBut the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed\n   No interest in the concern: \nThough the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,\n   And vainly proceeded to cite\nA number of cases, in which making laces\n   Had been proved an infringement of right. \nThe maker of Bonnets ferociously planned\n   A novel arrangement of bows:\nWhile the Billiard-marker with quivering hand\n   Was chalking the tip of his nose. \nBut the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,\n   With yellow kid gloves and a ruff—\nSaid he felt it exactly like going to dine,\n   Which the Bellman declared was all "stuff." \n"Introduce me, now there\'s a good fellow," he said,\n   "If we happen to meet it together!"\nAnd the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,\n   Said "That must depend on the weather." \nThe Beaver went simply galumphing about,\n   At seeing the Butcher so shy:\nAnd even the Baker, though stupid and stout,\n   Made an effort to wink with one eye. \n"Be a man!" said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard\n   The Butcher beginning to sob.\n"Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,\n   We shall need all our strength for the job!" \n             Fit the Fifth\n               The Beaver\'s Lesson \nThey sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n   They pursued it with forks and hope;\nThey threatened its life with a railway-share;\n   They charmed it with smiles and soap. \nThen the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan\n   For making a separate sally;\nAnd had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,\n   A dismal and desolate valley. \nBut the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:\n   It had chosen the very same place:\nYet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,\n   The disgust that appeared in his face. \nEach thought he was thinking of nothing but "Snark"\n   And the glorious work of the day;\nAnd each tried to pretend that he did not remark\n   That the other was going that way. \nBut the valley grew narrow and narrower still,\n   And the evening got darker and colder,\nTill (merely from nervousness, not from good will)\n   They marched along shoulder to shoulder. \nThen a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,\n   And they knew that some danger was near:\nThe Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,\n   And even the Butcher felt queer. \nHe thought of his childhood, left far far behind—\n   That blissful and innocent state—\nThe sound so exactly recalled to his mind\n   A pencil that squeaks on a slate! \n"\'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!" he suddenly cried.\n   (This man, that they used to call "Dunce.")\n"As the Bellman would tell you," he added with pride,\n   "I have uttered that sentiment once. \n"\'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;\n   You will find I have told it you twice.\nTis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,\n   If only I\'ve stated it thrice." \nThe Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,\n   Attending to every word:\nBut it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,\n   When the third repetition occurred. \nIt felt that, in spite of all possible pains,\n   It had somehow contrived to lose count,\nAnd the only thing now was to rack its poor brains\n   By reckoning up the amount. \n"Two added to one—if that could but be done,"\n   It said, "with one\'s fingers and thumbs!"\nRecollecting with tears how, in earlier years,\n   It had taken no pains with its sums. \n"The thing can be done," said the Butcher, "I think.\n   The thing must be done, I am sure.\nThe thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,\n   The best there is time to procure." \nThe Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,\n   And ink in unfailing supplies:\nWhile strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,\n   And watched them with wondering eyes. \nSo engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,\n   As he wrote with a pen in each hand,\nAnd explained all the while in a popular style\n   Which the Beaver could well understand. \n"Taking Three as the subject to reason about—\n   A convenient number to state—\nWe add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out\n   By One Thousand diminished by Eight. \n"The result we proceed to divide, as you see,\n   By Nine Hundred and Ninety and Two:\nThen subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be\n   Exactly and perfectly true. \n"The method employed I would gladly explain,\n   While I have it so clear in my head,\nIf I had but the time and you had but the brain—\n   But much yet remains to be said. \n"In one moment I\'ve seen what has hitherto been\n   Enveloped in absolute mystery,\nAnd without extra charge I will give you at large\n   A Lesson in Natural History." \nIn his genial way he proceeded to say\n   (Forgetting all laws of propriety,\nAnd that giving instruction, without introduction,\n   Would have caused quite a thrill in Society), \n"As to temper the Jubjub\'s a desperate bird,\n   Since it lives in perpetual passion:\nIts taste in costume is entirely absurd—\n   It is ages ahead of the fashion: \n"But it knows any friend it has met once before:\n   It never will look at a bribe:\nAnd in charity-meetings it stands at the door,\n   And collects—though it does not subscribe. \n"Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far\n   Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:\n(Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,\n   And some, in mahogany kegs:) \n"You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:\n   You condense it with locusts and tape:\nStill keeping one principal object in view—\n   To preserve its symmetrical shape." \nThe Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,\n   But he felt that the Lesson must end,\nAnd he wept with delight in attempting to say\n   He considered the Beaver his friend. \nWhile the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks\n   More eloquent even than tears,\nIt had learned in ten minutes far more than all books\n   Would have taught it in seventy years. \nThey returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned\n   (For a moment) with noble emotion,\nSaid "This amply repays all the wearisome days\n   We have spent on the billowy ocean!" \nSuch friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,\n   Have seldom if ever been known;\nIn winter or summer, \'twas always the same—\n   You could never meet either alone. \nAnd when quarrels arose—as one frequently finds\n   Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour—\nThe song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,\n   And cemented their friendship for ever! \n            Fit the Sixth\n               The Barrister\'s Dream \nThey sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n   They pursued it with forks and hope;\nThey threatened its life with a railway-share;\n   They charmed it with smiles and soap. \nBut the Barrister, weary of proving in vain\n   That the Beaver\'s lace-making was wrong,\nFell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain\n   That his fancy had dwelt on so long. \nHe dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,\n   Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,\nDressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig\n   On the charge of deserting its sty. \nThe Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,\n   That the sty was deserted when found:\nAnd the Judge kept explaining the state of the law\n   In a soft under-current of sound. \nThe indictment had never been clearly expressed,\n   And it seemed that the Snark had begun,\nAnd had spoken three hours, before any one guessed\n   What the pig was supposed to have done. \nThe Jury had each formed a different view\n   (Long before the indictment was read),\nAnd they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew\n   One word that the others had said. \n"You must know—" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed "Fudge!"\n   That statute is obsolete quite!\nLet me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends\n   On an ancient manorial right. \n"In the matter of Treason the pig would appear\n   To have aided, but scarcely abetted:\nWhile the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,\n   If you grant the plea \'never indebted.\' \n"The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;\n   But its guilt, as I trust, is removed\n(So far as relates to the costs of this suit)\n   By the Alibi which has been proved. \n"My poor client\'s fate now depends on your votes."\n   Here the speaker sat down in his place,\nAnd directed the Judge to refer to his notes\n   And briefly to sum up the case. \nBut the Judge said he never had summed up before;\n   So the Snark undertook it instead,\nAnd summed it so well that it came to far more\n   Than the Witnesses ever had said! \nWhen the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,\n   As the word was so puzzling to spell;\nBut they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn\'t mind\n   Undertaking that duty as well. \nSo the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,\n   It was spent with the toils of the day:\nWhen it said the word "GUILTY!" the Jury all groaned,\n   And some of them fainted away. \nThen the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite\n   Too nervous to utter a word:\nWhen it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,\n   And the fall of a pin might be heard. \n"Transportation for life" was the sentence it gave,\n   "And then to be fined forty pound."\nThe Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared\n   That the phrase was not legally sound. \nBut their wild exultation was suddenly checked\n   When the jailer informed them, with tears,\nSuch a sentence would have not the slightest effect,\n   As the pig had been dead for some years. \nThe Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:\n   But the Snark, though a little aghast,\nAs the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,\n   Went bellowing on to the last. \nThus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed\n   To grow every moment more clear:\nTill he woke to the knell of a furious bell,\n   Which the Bellman rang close at his ear. \n            Fit the Seventh\n               The Banker\'s Fate \nThey sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n   They pursued it with forks and hope;\nThey threatened its life with a railway-share;\n   They charmed it with smiles and soap. \nAnd the Banker, inspired with a courage so new\n   It was matter for general remark,\nRushed madly ahead and was lost to their view\n   In his zeal to discover the Snark \nBut while he was seeking with thimbles and care,\n   A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh\nAnd grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,\n   For he knew it was useless to fly. \nHe offered large discount—he offered a cheque\n   (Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:\nBut the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck\n   And grabbed at the Banker again. \nWithout rest or pause—while those frumious jaws\n   Went savagely snapping around—\nHe skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,\n   Till fainting he fell to the ground. \nThe Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared\n   Led on by that fear-stricken yell:\nAnd the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared!"\n   And solemnly tolled on his bell. \nHe was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace\n   The least likeness to what he had been:\nWhile so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white—\n   A wonderful thing to be seen! \nTo the horror of all who were present that day,\n   He uprose in full evening dress,\nAnd with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say\n   What his tongue could no longer express. \nDown he sank in a chair—ran his hands through his hair—\n   And chanted in mimsiest tones\nWords whose utter inanity proved his insanity,\n   While he rattled a couple of bones. \n"Leave him here to his fate—it is getting so late!"\n   The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.\n"We have lost half the day. Any further delay,\n   And we sha\'n\'t catch a Snark before night!" \n            Fit the Eighth\n               The Vanishing \nThey sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n   They pursued it with forks and hope;\nThey threatened its life with a railway-share;\n   They charmed it with smiles and soap. \nThey shuddered to think that the chase might fail,\n   And the Beaver, excited at last,\nWent bounding along on the tip of its tail,\n   For the daylight was nearly past. \n"There is Thingumbob shouting!" the Bellman said,\n   "He is shouting like mad, only hark!\nHe is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,\n   He has certainly found a Snark!" \nThey gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed\n   "He was always a desperate wag!"\nThey beheld him—their Baker—their hero unnamed—\n   On the top of a neighbouring crag, \nErect and sublime, for one moment of time,\n   In the next, that wild figure they saw\n(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,\n   While they waited and listened in awe. \n"It\'s a Snark!" was the sound that first came to their ears,\n   And seemed almost too good to be true.\nThen followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:\n   Then the ominous words "It\'s a Boo—" \nThen, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air\n   A weary and wandering sigh\nThat sounded like "-jum!" but the others declare\n   It was only a breeze that went by. \nThey hunted till darkness came on, but they found\n   Not a button, or feather, or mark,\nBy which they could tell that they stood on the ground\n   Where the Baker had met with the Snark. \nIn the midst of the word he was trying to say,\n   In the midst of his laughter and glee,\nHe had softly and suddenly vanished away—\n   For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.\n', '\nI am the only being whose doom\nNo tongue would ask, no eye would mourn;\nI never caused a thought of gloom,\nA smile of joy, since I was born. \nIn secret pleasure, secret tears,\nThis changeful life has slipped away,\nAs friendless after eighteen years,\nAs lone as on my natal day. \nThere have been times I cannot hide,\nThere have been times when this was drear,\nWhen my sad soul forgot its pride\nAnd longed for one to love me here. \nBut those were in the early glow\nOf feelings since subdued by care;\nAnd they have died so long ago,\nI hardly now believe they were. \nFirst melted off the hope of youth,\nThen fancy’s rainbow fast withdrew;\nAnd then experience told me truth\nIn mortal bosoms never grew. \n’Twas grief enough to think mankind\nAll hollow, servile, insincere;\nBut worse to trust to my own mind\nAnd find the same corruption there.\n \n', '\nI heard a Fly buzz - when I died -\nThe Stillness in the Room\nWas like the Stillness in the Air -\nBetween the Heaves of Storm - \nThe Eyes around - had wrung them dry -\nAnd Breaths were gathering firm\nFor that last Onset - when the King\nBe witnessed - in the Room - \nI willed my Keepsakes - Signed away\nWhat portion of me be\nAssignable - and then it was\nThere interposed a Fly - \nWith Blue - uncertain - stumbling Buzz -\nBetween the light - and me -\nAnd then the Windows failed - and then\nI could not see to see -\n', '\nI’m thankful that my life doth not deceive\nItself with a low loftiness, half height,\nAnd think it soars when still it dip its way\nBeneath the clouds on noiseless pinion\nLike the crow or owl, but it doth know\nThe full extent of all its trivialness,\nCompared with the splendid heights above.\n See how it waits to watch the mail come in\nWhile ’hind its back the sun goes out perchance.\nAnd yet their lumbering cart brings me no word,\nNot one scrawled leaf such as my neighbors get\nTo cheer them with the slight events forsooth,\nFaint ups and downs of their far distant friends—\nAnd now ’tis passed.

Not so the ancients of these lands—     The Indian, when from life released, Again is seated with his friends,     And shares again the joyous feast.  His imaged birds, and painted bowl,     And venison, for a journey dressed, Bespeak the nature of the soul,     Activity, that knows no rest.

Beyond its shrivelled tassels, perched upon The topmost rail, sits Joe, the settler’s son, A little semi-savage boy of nine. Now dozing in the warmth of Nature’s wine, His face the sun has tampered with, and wrought, By heated kisses, mischief, and has brought Some vagrant freckles, while from here and there A few wild locks of vagabond brown hair Escape the old straw hat the sun looks through, And blinks to meet his Irish eyes of blue. Barefooted, innocent of coat or vest, His grey checked shirt unbuttoned at his chest, Both hardy hands within their usual nest—   His breeches pockets — so, he waits to rest His little fingers, somewhat tired and worn, That all day long were husking Indian corn. His drowsy lids snap at some trivial sound, With lazy yawns he slips towards the ground, Then with an idle whistle lifts his load And shambles home along the country road That stretches on fringed out with stumps and weeds, And finally unto the backwoods leads, Where forests wait with giant trunk and bough The axe of pioneer, the settler’s plough.  \n', '\nWhen I was a boy and a man would die \nwe’d say a verse when the hearse went by \none car two car three car four\nsomeone knocking on the devil’s door.\nI smoked all night myself awake\nand saw the lights and the day break. \nWhen the sun was done with the final star \nI left the house and the door ajar\nand went to the church.

Now the sun Darts burning splendor on the glittering pane, Save where the canvas awning throws a shade On the gay merchandise. Now, spruce and trim, In shops (where beauty smiles with industry) Sits the smart damsel; while the passenger Peeps through the window, watching every charm. Now pastry dainties catch the eye minute Of humming insects, while the limy snare Waits to enthrall them. Now the lamp-lighter Mounts the tall ladder, nimbly venturous, To trim the half-filled lamps, while at his feet The pot-boy yells discordant! All along The sultry pavement, the old-clothes-man cries In tone monotonous, while sidelong views The area for his traffic: now the bag Is slyly opened, and the half-worn suit (Sometimes the pilfered treasure of the base Domestic spoiler), for one half its worth, Sinks in the green abyss.

The breeze comes softly, Laden with tribute that a hundred orchards Now in their fullest blossom send, in thanks For this refreshing shower. The birds pour forth In heightened melody the notes of praise They had suspended while God’s voice was speaking, And his eye flashing down upon his world. I sigh, half-charmed, half-pained. My sense is living, And, taking in this freshened beauty, tells Its pleasure to the mind. The mind replies, And strives to wake the heart in turn, repeating Poetic sentiments from many a record Which other souls have left, when stirred and satisfied By scenes as fair, as fragrant. But the heart Sends back a hollow echo to the call Of outward things, — and its once bright companion, Who erst would have been answered by a stream Of life-fraught treasures, thankful to be summoned, — Can now rouse nothing better than this echo; Unmeaning voice, which mocks their softened accents. Content thee, beautiful world! and hush, still busy mind! My heart hath sealed its fountains. To the things Of Time they shall be oped no more. Too long, Too often were they poured forth: part have sunk Into the desert; part profaned and swollen By bitter waters, mixed by those who feigned They asked them for refreshment, which, turned back, Have broken and o’erflowed their former urns. So when ye talk of pleasure, lonely world, And busy mind, ye ne’er again shall move me To answer ye, though still your calls have power To jar me through, and cause dull aching here.  No so the voice which hailed me from the depths Of yon dark-bosomed cloud, now vanishing Before the sun ye greet. It touched my centre, The voice of the Eternal, calling me To feel his other worlds; to feel that if I could deserve a home, I still might find it In other spheres, — and bade me not despair, Though ‘want of harmony’ and ‘aching void’ Are terms invented by the men of this, Which I may not forget.                                  In former times I loved to see the lightnings flash athwart The stooping heavens; I loved to hear the thunder Call to the seas and mountains; for I thought ‘Tis thus man’s flashing fancy doth enkidle The firmament of mind; ‘tis thus his eloquence   Calls unto the soul’s depths and heights; and still I defied the creature, nor remembered The Creator in his works.                                     Ah now how different! The proud delight of that keen sympathy Is gone; no longer riding on the wave, But whelmed beneath it: my own plans and works, Or, as the Scriptures phrase it, my ’inventions’ No longer interpose ‘twist me and Heaven.  Today, for the first time, I felt the Deity, And uttered prayer on hearing thunder. This Must be thy will, — for finer, higher spirits Have gone through this same process, — yet I think There was religion in that strong delight, Those sounds, those thoughts of power imparted. True, I did not say, ‘He is the Lord thy God,’ But I had feeling of his essence. But ‘’Twas pride by which the angels fell.’ So be it! But O, might I but see a little onward! Father, I cannot be a spirit of power; May I be active as a spirit of love, Since thou hast ta’en me from that path which Nature Seemed to appoint, O, deign to ope another, Where I may walk with thought and hope assured; ‘Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief!’ Had I but faith like that which fired Novalis, I too could bear that the heart ‘fall in ashes,’ While the freed spirit rises from beneath them, With heavenward-look, and Phoenix-plumes upsoaring!\n', '\nThe wooden horses\nare tired of their courses\nand plead from head to hoof \nto be fed to a stove—\nIn leaping lunging flames \nthey’d rise again, flared manes\nsnapping like chains behind them. \nThe smoke would not blind them\nas do these children’s hands: \nbeyond our cruel commands\nthe fire will free them then \nas once the artisan when\nout of the tree they\nwere nagged to this neigh.\n', '\n                    \n                    \n                    Out of the golden West, out of the leaden East, into the iron South, and to the silver North . . .

From thy poor tongue no accents come, Which can but rub thy toothless gum: Small understanding boasts thy face, Thy shapeless limbs nor step nor grace: A few short words thy feats may tell, And yet I love thee well.  When wakes the sudden bitter shriek, And redder swells thy little cheek When rattled keys thy woes beguile, And through thine eyelids gleams the smile, Still for thy weakly self is spent Thy little silly plaint.  But when thy friends are in distress. Thou’lt laugh and chuckle n’ertheless, Nor with kind sympathy be smitten, Though all are sad but thee and kitten; Yet puny varlet that thou art, Thou twitchest at the heart.  Thy smooth round cheek so soft and warm; Thy pinky hand and dimpled arm; Thy silken locks that scantly peep, With gold tipped ends, where circle deep, Around thy neck in harmless grace, So soft and sleekly hold their place, Might harder hearts with kindness fill, And gain our right goodwill.  Each passing clown bestows his blessing, Thy mouth is worn with old wives’ kissing; E’en lighter looks the gloomy eye Of surly sense when thou art by; And yet, I think, whoe’er they be, They love thee not like me.  Perhaps when time shall add a few Short years to thee, thou’lt love me too; And after that, through life’s long way, Become my sure and cheering stay; Wilt care for me and be my hold, When I am weak and old.  Thou’lt listen to my lengthened tale, And pity me when I am frail — But see, the sweepy spinning fly Upon the window takes thine eye.

The dang'rous Passions kept aloof, Far from the sainted growing woof; But near it sate ecstatic Wonder, List'ning the deep applauding thunder; And Truth, in sunny vest arrayed, By whose the tarsel's eyes were made; All the shad'wy tribes of Mind, In braided dance their murmurs joined; And all the bright uncounted powers Who feed on Heav'n's ambrosial flowers.

The Fate and Silence closed life’s blissful scene, Its being past, as it had never been. The sad rememberance only now remains, And by contrasting aggravates my pains. Hope still attendant and delusive stands, And points, but coldly points, to distant lands; Gilds their faint summits with her flatt’ring ray; But deserts, rocks, and seas obstruct the way; And age, and sickness, and the clouds that teem With unknown thunders, through the prospect gleam.  Ah me! no Gods, nor Angels now descend, The sons of men in pity to befriend! My sufferings else might some kind spirit move To give me back on terms the wife I love: And more than half my life would I resign, For health, her purchase, and herself, for mine, Borne by the Pow’rs of Air, or she should rise, Or I rejoin her through the distant skies. No more my thoughts in solitude should mourn My sweet companion from my presence torn; Nor rigid duty force me to remain, And see her sails diminish on the main.

Existence is as deep a verity: Without the dual, where is unity? And the ‘I am’ cannot forbear to be;  But from its primal nature forced to frame Mysteries, destinies of various name, Is forced to give what it has taught to claim.  Thus love must answer to its own unrest; The bad commands us to expect the best, And hope of its own prospects is the test.  And dost thou seek to find the one in two? Only upon the old can build the new; The symbol which you seek is found in you.  The heart and mind, the wisdom and the will, The man and woman, must be severed still, And Christ must reconcile the good and ill.  There are to whom each symbol is a mask; The life of love is a mysterious task; They want no answer, for they would not ask.  A single thought transfuses every form; The sunny day is changed into the storm, For light is dark, hard soft, and cold is warm.  One presence fills and floods the whole serene; Nothing can be, nothing has ever been, Except the one truth that creates the scene.  Does the heart beat, — that is a seeming only; You cannot be alone, though you are lonely; The All is neutralized in the One only.  You ask a faith, — they are content with faith; You ask to have, — but they reply, ‘IT hath.’ There is no end, and there need be no path.  The day wears heavily, — why, then, ignore it; Peace is the soul’s desire, — such thoughts restore it; The truth thou art, — it needs not to implore it.  The Presence all thy fancies supersedes, All that is done which thou wouldst seek in deeds, The wealth obliterates all seeming needs.  Both these are true, and if they are at strife, The mystery bears the one name of Life, That, slowly spelled, will yet compose the strife.  The men of old say, ‘Live twelve thousand years, And see the need of all that here appears, And Moxen* shall absorb thy smiles and tears.’  These later men say, ‘Live this little day. Believe that human nature is the way, And know both Son and Father while you pray;  And one in two, in three, and none alone, Letting you know even as you are known, Shall make the you and me eternal parts of one.’  To me, our destinies seem flower and fruit Born of an ever-generating root; The other statement I cannot dispute.  But say that Love and Life eternal seem, And if eternal ties be but a dream, What is the meaning of that self-same seem?  Your nature craves Eternity for Truth; Eternity of Love is prayer of youth; How, without love, would have gone forth your truth?  I do not think we are deceived to grow, But that the crudest fancy, slightest show, Covers some separate truth that we may know.  In the one Truth, each separate fact is true; Eternally in one I many view, And destinies through destiny pursue.  This is my tendency; but can I say That this my thought leads the true, only way? I only know it constant leads, and I obey.  I only know one prayer — ‘Give me the truth, Give me that colored whiteness, ancient youth, Complex and simple, seen in joy and truth.  Let me not by vain wishes bar my claim, Nor soothe my hunger by an empty name,  Nor crucify the Son of man by hasty blame.  But in the earth and fire, water and air, Live earnestly by turns without despair, Nor seek a home till home be every where!’\n', '\nI do not know if, climbing some steep hill,  Through fragrant wooded pass, this glimpse I bought, Or whether in some mid-day I was caught To upper air, where visions of God’s will In pictures to our quickened sense fulfil His word. But this I saw.                                     A path I sought Through wall of rock. No human fingers wrought The golden gates which opened sudden, still, And wide. My fear was hushed by my delight. Surpassing fair the lands; my path lay plain; Alas, so spell-bound, feasting on the sight, I paused, that I but reached the threshold bright, When, swinging swift, the golden gates again Were rocky wall, by which I wept in vain.  \n', '\nGone to seed, ailanthus, the poverty\n   tree.

Perhaps Tom the footman has fired her heart; And she’ll tell us how charming he looks in new clothes, And how nimble his hand moves in brushing the shoes; Or how, the last time that he went to May Fair, He bought her some sweethearts of gingerbread ware.” “For my part I think,” says old Lady Marr-joy, “A servant might find herself other employ: Was she mine I’d employ her as long as ’twas light, And send her to bed without candle at night.” “Why so?” says Miss Rhymer, displeased: “I protest ’Tis pity a genius should be so depressed!” “What ideas can such low-bred creatures conceive?” Says Mrs. Noworthy, and laughed in her sleeve. Says old Miss Prudella, “If servants can tell How to write to their mothers, to say they are well, And read of a Sunday The Duty of Man, Which is more I believe than one half of them can; I think ’tis much properer they should rest there, Than be reaching at things so much out of their sphere.” Says old Mrs. Candour, “I’ve now got a maid That’s the plague of my life—a young gossiping jade; There’s no end of the people that after her come, And whenever I’m out, she is never at home; I’d rather ten times she would sit down and write, Than gossip all over the town every night.” “Some whimsical trollop most like,” says Miss Prim, “Has been scribbling of nonsense, just out of a whim, And, conscious it neither is witty nor pretty, Conceals her true name, and ascribes it to Betty.” “I once had a servant myself,” says Miss Pines, “That wrote on a wedding some very good lines.” Says Mrs. Domestic, “And when they were done, I can’t see for my part what use they were on; Had she wrote a receipt, to’ve instructed you how To warm a cold breast of veal, like a ragout, Or to make cowslip wine, that would pass for Champagne, It might have been useful, again and again.” On the sofa was old Lady Pedigree placed; She owned that for poetry she had no taste, That the study of heraldry was more in fashion, And boasted she knew all the crests in the nation. Says Mrs. Routella, “Tom, take out the urn, And stir up the fire, you see it don’t burn.”    The tea-things removed, and the tea-table gone, The card-tables brought, and the cards laid thereon, The ladies, ambitious for each other’s crown, Like courtiers contending for honours, sat down.\n', '\nAlong Ancona’s hills the shimmering heat,\nA tropic tide of air with ebb and flow\nBathes all the fields of wheat until they glow\nLike flashing seas of green, which toss and beat\nAround the vines.

In snowy shirt unbraced, brown Robin stood, And leant upon his flail in thoughtful mood: His full round cheek where deeper flushes glow, The dewy drops which glisten on his brow; His dark cropped pate that erst at church or fair, So smooth and silky, showed his morning’s care, Which, all uncouth in matted locks combined, Now, ends erect, defies the ruffling wind; His neck-band loose, and hosen rumpled low, A careful lad, nor slack at labour, show. Nor scraping chickens chirping ’mongst the straw, Nor croaking rook o’erhead, nor chattering daw; Loud-breathing cow amongst the rampy weeds, Nor grunting sow that in the furrows feeds: Nor sudden breeze that shakes the quaking leaves, And lightly rustles through the scattered sheaves; Nor floating straw that skims athwart his nose, The deeply-musing youth may discompose. For Nelly fair, the blithest village maid, Whose tuneful voice beneath the hedgerow-shade, At early milking, o’er the meadows borne, E’er cheered the ploughman’s toil at rising morn: The neatest maid that e’er, in linen gown, Bore cream and butter to the market town: The tightest lass, that with untutored air, E’er footed alehouse floor at wake or fair, Since Easter last had Robin’s heart possessed, And many a time disturbed his nightly rest. Full oft, returning from the loosened plough, He slacked his pace, and knit his thoughtful brow; And oft, ere half his thresher’s talk was o’er, Would muse, with arms across, at cooling door: His mind thus bent, with downcast eyes he stood, And leant upon his flail in thoughtful mood. His soul o’er many a soft rememberance ran, And, muttering to himself, the youth began.     ‘Ah! happy is the man whose early lot Hath made him master of a furnished cot; Who trains the vine that round his window grows, And after setting sun his garden hoes; Whose wattled pales his own enclosure shield, Who toils not daily in another’s field. Wheree’er he goes, to church or market-town, With more respect he and his dog are known; A brisker face he wears at wake or fair, Nor views with longing eyes the pedlar’s ware, But buys at will or ribbands, gloves or beads, And willing maidens to the alehouse leads; And, oh! secure from toils which cumber life, He makes the maid he loves an easy wife. Ah, Nelly! canst thou, with contented mind, Become the helpmate of a labouring hind, And share his lot, whate’er the chances be, Who hath no dower but love to fix on thee? Yes, gayest maid may meekest matron prove, And things of little note may ’token love. When from the church thou cam’st at eventide And I and red-haired Susan by thy side, I pulled the blossoms from the bending tree, And some to Susan gave, and some to thee; Thine were the best, and well thy smiling eye The difference marked, and guessed the reason why. When on a holiday we rambling strayed, And passed old Hodge’s cottage in the glade; Neat was the garden dressed, sweet hummed the bee, I wished both cot and Nelly made for me; And well methought thy very eyes revealed The self-same wish within thy breast concealed. When artful, once, I sought my love to tell, And spoke to thee of one who loved thee well, You saw the cheat, and jeering homeward hied, Yet secret pleasure in thy looks I spied. Ay, gayest maid may meekest matron prove, And smaller signs than these have ’tokened love.’     Now, at a distance, on the neighbouring plain, With creaking wheels slow comes the heavy wain: High on its towering load a maid appears, And Nelly’s voice sounds shrill in Robin’s ears. Quick from his hand he throws the cumbrous flail, And leaps with lightsome limbs the enclosing pale. O’er field and fence he scours, and furrows wide, With wakened Comrade barking by his side; Whilst tracks of trodden grain, and sidelong hay, And broken hedge-flowers sweet, mark his impetuous way. \n', "\nYes, injured Woman! rise, assert thy right!\nWoman! too long degraded, scorned, opprest;\nO born to rule in partial Law's despite,\nResume thy native empire o'er the breast! \nGo forth arrayed in panoply divine;\nThat angel pureness which admits no stain;\nGo, bid proud Man his boasted rule resign,\nAnd kiss the golden sceptre of thy reign. \nGo, gird thyself with grace; collect thy store\nOf bright artillery glancing from afar;\nSoft melting tones thy thundering cannon's roar,\nBlushes and fears thy magazine of war. \nThy rights are empire: urge no meaner claim,—\nFelt, not defined, and if debated, lost;\nLike sacred mysteries, which withheld from fame,\nShunning discussion, are revered the most. \nTry all that wit and art suggest to bend\nOf thy imperial foe the stubborn knee;\nMake treacherous Man thy subject, not thy friend;\nThou mayst command, but never canst be free. \nAwe the licentious, and restrain the rude;\nSoften the sullen, clear the cloudy brow:\nBe, more than princes' gifts, thy favours sued;—\nShe hazards all, who will the least allow. \nBut hope not, courted idol of mankind,\nOn this proud eminence secure to stay;\nSubduing and subdued, thou soon shalt find\nThy coldness soften, and thy pride give way. \nThen, then, abandon each ambitious thought,\nConquest or rule thy heart shall feebly move,\nIn Nature's school, by her soft maxims taught,\nThat separate rights are lost in mutual love.\n", '\nWhen Britain first, at heaven\'s command,     Arose from out the azure main, This was the charter of the land,     And guardian angels sung this strain—        "Rule, Britannia, rule the waves;        Britons never will be slaves."  The nations, not so blest as thee,     Must in their turns to tyrants fall; While thou shalt flourish great and free,     The dread and envy of them all.

of languor, finds at last;\nWhat forms the real picture of the poor,\nDemands a song—the Muse can give no more.\nFled are those times, if e\'er such times were seen, \nWhen rustic poets praised their native green;\nNo shepherds now, in smooth alternate verse,\nTheir country\'s beauty or their nymphs\' rehearse;\nYet still for these we frame the tender strain,\nStill in our lays fond Corydons complain,\nAnd shepherds\' boys their amorous pains reveal,\nThe only pains, alas! they never feel.\n On Mincio\'s banks, in Caesar\'s bounteous reign,\nIf Tityrus found the Golden Age again,\nMust sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong,\nMechanic echoes of the Mantuan song?\nFrom truth and nature shall we widely stray,\nWhere Virgil, not where Fancy, leads the way?\n Yes, thus the Muses sing of happy swains,\nBecause the Muses never knew their pains.\nThey boast their peasants\' pipes, but peasants now\nResign their pipes and plod behind the plough;\nAnd few amid the rural tribe have time\nTo number syllables and play with rhyme;\nSave honest Duck, what son of verse could share\nThe poet\'s rapture and the peasant\'s care?\nOr the great labours of the field degrade\nWith the new peril of a poorer trade?\n From one chief cause these idle praises spring,\nThat themes so easy few forbear to sing;\nThey ask no thought, require no deep design,\nBut swell the song and liquefy the line;\nThe gentle lover takes the rural strain,\nA nymph his mistress and himself a swain;\nWith no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer,\nBut all, to look like her, is painted fair.\nI grant indeed that fields and flocks have charms\nFor him that gazes or for him that farms;\nBut when amid such pleasing scenes I trace\nThe poor laborious natives of the place,\nAnd see the mid-day sun, with fervid ray,\nOn their bare heads and dewy temples play;\nWhile some, with feebler heads and fainter hearts,\nDeplore their fortune, yet sustain their parts:\nThen shall I dare these real ills to hide\nIn tinsel trappings of poetic pride?\n No, cast by Fortune on a frowning coast,\nWhich can no groves nor happy valleys boast;\nWhere other cares than those the Muse relates,\nAnd other shepherds dwell with other mates;\nBy such examples taught, I paint the cot,\nAs truth will paint it, and as bards will not:\nNor you, ye poor, of lettered scorn complain,\nTo you the smoothest song is smooth in vain;\nO\'ercome by labour and bowed down by time,\nFeel you the barren flattery of a rhyme?\nCan poets soothe you, when you pine for bread,\nBy winding myrtles round your ruined shed?\nCan their light tales your weighty griefs o\'erpower,\nOr glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour?\n Lo! where the heath, with withering brake grown o\'er,\nLends the light turf that warms the neighboring poor;\nFrom thence a length of burning sand appears,\nWhere the thin harvest waves its withered ears;\nRank weeds, that every art and care defy,\nReign o\'er the land and rob the blighted rye:\nThere thistles stretch their prickly arms afar,\nAnd to the ragged infant threaten war;\nThere poppies, nodding, mock the hope of toil,\nThere the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil;\nHardy and high, above the slender sheaf,\nThe slimy mallow waves her silky leaf;\nO\'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade,\nAnd the wild tare clings round the sickly blade;\nWith mingled tints the rocky coasts abound,\nAnd a sad splendor vainly shines around.\n So looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn,\nBetrayed by man, then left for man to scorn;\nWhose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose\nWhile her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose;\nWhose outward splendour is but folly\'s dress,\nExposing most, when most it gilds distress.\n Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race,\nWith sullen woe displayed in every face;\nWho far from civil arts and social fly,\nAnd scowl at strangers with suspicious eye.\n Here too the lawless merchant of the main\nDraws from his plough th\' intoxicated swain;\nWant only claimed the labor of the day,\nBut vice now steals his nightly rest away.\n Where are the swains, who, daily labor done,\nWith rural games played down the setting sun;\nWho struck with matchless force the bounding ball,\nOr made the pond\'rous quoit obliquely fall;\nWhile some huge Ajax, terrible and strong,\nEngaged some artful stripling of the throng,\nAnd, foiled, beneath the young Ulysses fell,\nWhen peals of praise the merry mischief tell?\nWhere now are these?—Beneath yon cliff they stand,\nTo show the freighted pinnace where to land;\nTo load the ready steed with guilty haste;\nTo fly in terror o\'er the pathless waste,\nOr, when detected in their straggling course,\nTo foil their foes by cunning or by force;\nOr, yielding part (when equal knaves contest),\nTo gain a lawless passport for the rest.\n Here, wand\'ring long amid these frowning fields,\nI sought the simple life that Nature yields;\nRapine and Wrong and Fear usurped her place,\nAnd a bold, artful, surly, savage race;\nWho, only skilled to take the finny tribe,\nThe yearly dinner, or septennial bribe\nWait on the shore and, as the waves run high,\nOn the tossed vessel bend their eager eye,\nWhich to their coast directs its vent\'rous way,\nTheirs, or the ocean\'s, miserable prey.\n As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand,\nAnd wait for favoring winds to leave the land;\nWhile still for flight the ready wing is spread:\nSo waited I the favouring hour, and fled;\nFled from these shores where guilt and famine reign,\nAnd cried, Ah! hapless they who still remain;\nWho still remain to hear the ocean roar,\nWhose greedy waves devour the lessening shore;\nTill some fierce tide, with more imperious sway,\nSweeps the low hut and all it holds away;\nWhen the sad tenant weeps from door to door,\nAnd begs a poor protection from the poor!\n But these are scenes where Nature\'s niggard hand\nGave a spare portion to the famished land;\nHers is the fault, if here mankind complain\nOf fruitless toil and labor spent in vain;\nBut yet in other scenes, more fair in view,\nWhere Plenty smiles—alas! she smiles for few\nAnd those who taste not, yet behold her store,\nAre as the slaves that dig the golden ore,\nThe wealth around them makes them doubly poor.\nOr will you deem them amply paid in health,\nLabor\'s fair child, that languishes with wealth?\nGo then! and see them rising with the sun,\nThrough a long course of daily toil to run;\nLike him to make the plenteous harvest grow,\nAnd yet not shard the plenty they bestow;\nSee them beneath the dog-star\'s raging heat,\nWhen the knees tremble and the temples beat;\nBehold them, leaning on their scythes, look o\'er\nThe labour past, and toils to come explore;\nSee them alternate suns and showers engage,\nAnd hoard up aches and anguish for their age;\nThrough fens and marshy moors their steps pursue,\nWhen their warm pores imbibe the evening dew;\nThen own that labour may as fatal be\nTo these thy slaves, as luxury to thee.\n Amid this tribe too oft a manly pride\nStrives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide;\nThere may you see the youth of slender frame\nContend with weakness, weariness, and shame:\nYet urged along, and proudly loth to yield,\nHe strives to join his fellows of the field;\nTill long-contending nature droops at last,\nDeclining health rejects his poor repast,\nHis cheerless spouse the coming danger sees,\nAnd mutual murmurs urge the slow disease.\nYet grant them health, \'tis not for us to tell,\nThough the head droops not, that the heart is well;\nOr will you urge their homely, plenteous fare,\nHealthy and plain and still the poor man\'s share!\nOh! trifle not with wants you cannot feel,\nNor mock the misery of a stinted meal;\nHomely not wholesome, plain not plenteous, such\nAs you who envy would disdain to touch.\n Ye gentle souls, who dream of rural ease,\nWhom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please;\nGo! if the peaceful cot your praises share,\nGo, look within, and ask if peace be there:\nIf peace be his—that drooping weary sire,\nOr theirs, that offspring round their feeble fire,\nOr hers, that matron pale, whose trembling hand\nTurns on the wretched hearth th\' expiring brand.\nNor yet can time itself obtain for these\nLife\'s latest comforts, due respect and ease;\nFor yonder see that hoary swain, whose age\nCan with no cares except his own engage;\nWho, propped on that rude staff, looks up to see\nThe bare arms broken from the withering tree,\nOn which, a boy, he climbed the loftiest bough,\nThen his first joy, but his sad emblem now.\n He once was chief in all the rustic trade,\nHis steady hand the straightest furrow made;\nFull many a prize he won, and still is proud\nTo find the triumphs of his youth allowed.\nA transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes,\nHe hears and smiles, then thinks again and sighs:\nFor now he journeys to his grave in pain;\nThe rich disdain him, nay, the poor disdain;\nAlternate masters now their slave command,\nAnd urge the efforts of his feeble hand;\nWho, when his age attempts its task in vain,\nWith ruthless taunts of lazy poor complain.\n Oft may you see him, when he tends the sheep,\nHis winter-charge, beneath the hillock weep;\nOft hear him murmur to the winds that blow\nO\'er his white locks and bury them in snow;\nWhen, roused by rage and muttering in the morn,\nHe mends the broken hedge with icy thorn:\n "Why do I live, when I desire to be\nAt once from life and life\'s long labour free?\nLike leaves in spring, the young are blown away,\nWithout the sorrows of a slow decay;\nI, like yon withered leaf, remain behind,\nNipped by the frost, and shivering in the wind;\nThere it abides till younger buds come on,\nAs I, now all my fellow-swains are gone;\nThen, from the rising generation thrust,\nIt falls, like me, unnoticed to the dust.\n "These fruitful fields, these numerous flocks I see,\nAre others\' gain, but killing cares to me;\nTo me the children of my youth are lords,\nSlow in their gifts but hasty in their words:\nWants of their own demand their care, and who\nFeels his own want and succors others too?\nA lonely, wretched man, in pain I go,\nNone need my help and none relieve my woe;\nThen let my bones beneath the turf be laid,\nAnd men forget the wretch they would not aid."\n Thus groan the old, till, by disease oppressed,\nThey taste a final woe, and then they rest.\nTheirs is yon house that holds the parish poor,\nWhose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door;\nThere, where the putrid vapours, flagging, play,\nAnd the dull wheel hums doleful through the day;\nThere children dwell, who know no parents\' care,\nParents, who know no children\'s love, dwell there;\nHeart-broken matrons on their joyless bed,\nForsaken wives, and mothers never wed;\nDejected widows with unheeded tears,\nAnd crippled age with more than childhood-fears;\nThe lame, the blind, and, far the happiest they!\nThe moping idiot and the madman gay.\n Here too the sick their final doom receive,\nHere brought, amid the scenes of grief, to grieve,\nWhere the loud groans from some sad chamber flow,\nMixed with the clamors of the crowd below;\nHere, sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow scan,\nAnd the cold charities of man to man:\nWhose laws indeed for ruined age provide,\nAnd strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride;\nBut still that scrap is bought with many a sigh,\nAnd pride embitters what it can\'t deny.\n Say ye, oppressed by some fantastic woes,\nSome jarring nerve that baffles your repose;\nWho press the downy couch, while slaves advance\nWith timid eye to read the distant glance;\nWho with sad prayers the weary doctor tease\nTo name the nameless ever-new disease;\nWho with mock patience dire complaints endure,\nWhich real pain, and that alone, can cure;\nHow would ye bear in real pain to lie,\nDespised, neglected, left alone to die?\nHow would ye bear to draw your latest breath,\nWhere all that\'s wretched paves the way for death?\n Such is that room which one rude beam divides,\nAnd naked rafters form the sloping sides;\nWhere the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen,\nAnd lath and mud is all that lie between;\nSave one dull pane, that, coarsely patched, gives way\nTo the rude tempest, yet excludes the day.\nHere, on a matted flock, with dust o\'erspread,\nThe drooping wretch reclines his languid head;\nFor him no hand the cordial cup applies,\nNor wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes;\nNo friends with soft discourse his pain beguile,\nNor promise hope till sickness wears a smile.\n But soon a loud and hasty summons calls,\nShakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls.\nAnon, a figure enters, quaintly neat,\nAll pride and business, bustle and conceit;\nWith looks unaltered by these scenes of woe,\nWith speed that, entering, speaks his haste to go,\nHe bids the gazing throng around him fly,\nAnd carries fate and physic in his eye;\nA potent quack, long versed in human ills,\nWho first insults the victim whom he kills;\nWhose murd\'rous hand a drowsy bench protect,\nAnd whose most tender mercy is neglect.\n Paid by the parish for attendance here,\nHe wears contempt upon his sapient sneer;\nIn haste he seeks the bed where misery lies,\nImpatience marked in his averted eyes;\nAnd, some habitual queries hurried o\'er,\nWithout reply, he rushes on the door:\nHis drooping patient, long inured to pain,\nAnd long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain;\nHe ceases now the feeble help to crave\nOf man, and mutely hastens to the grave.\n But ere his death some pious doubts arise,\nSome simple fears, which "bold bad" men despise;\nFain would he ask the parish priest to prove\nHis title certain to the joys above;\nFor this he sends the murmuring nurse, who calls\nThe holy stranger to these dismal walls;\nAnd doth not he, the pious man, appear,\nHe, "passing rich with forty pounds a year"?\nAh! no; a shepherd of a different stock,\nAnd far unlike him, feeds this little flock:\nA jovial youth, who thinks his Sunday\'s task\nAs much as God or man can fairly ask;\nThe rest he gives to loves and labors light,\nTo fields the morning and to feasts the night;\nNone better skilled the noisy pack to guide,\nTo urge their chase, to cheer them or to chide;\nSure in his shot, his game he seldom missed,\nAnd seldom failed to win his game at whist;\nThen, while such honors bloom around his head,\nShall he sit sadly by the sick man\'s bed\nTo raise the hope he feels not, or with zeal\nTo combat fears that ev\'n the pious feel\n Now once again the gloomy scene explore,\nLess gloomy now; the bitter hour is o\'er,\nThe man of many sorrows sighs no more.\n Up yonder hill, behold how sadly slow\nThe bier moves winding from the vale below;\nThere lie the happy dead, from trouble free,\nAnd the glad parish pays the frugal fee.\nNo more, oh Death! thy victim starts to hear\nChurchwarden stern, or kingly overseer;\nNo more the farmer gets his humble bow,\nThou art his lord, the best of tyrants thou!\n Now to the church behold the mourners come,\nSedately torpid and devoutly dumb;\nThe village children now their games suspend,\nTo see the bier that bears their ancient friend:\nFor he was one in all their idle sport,\nAnd like a monarch ruled their little court;\nThe pliant bow he formed, the flying ball,\nThe bat, the wicket, were his labours all;\nHim now they follow to his grave, and stand\nSilent and sad, and gazing, hand in hand;\nWhile bending low, their eager eyes explore\nThe mingled relics of the parish poor.\nThe bell tolls late, the moping owl flies round,\nFear marks the flight and magnifies the sound;\nThe busy priest, detained by weightier care,\nDefers his duty till the day of prayer;\nAnd, waiting long, the crowd retire distressed,\nTo think a poor man\'s bones should lie unblessed.\n', '']
